45. CHAPTER I
46. 
47. 
48. "Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
49. Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,
50. if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
51. Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more
52. to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful
53. slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened
54. you--sit down and tell me all the news."
55. 
56. It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna
57. Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With
58. these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and
59. importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna
60. had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la
61. grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the
62. elite.
63. 
64. All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered
65. by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:
66. 
67. "If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the
68. prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,
69. I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette
70. Scherer."
71. 
72. "Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the
73. least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an
74. embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on
75. his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that
76. refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and
77. with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance
78. who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna,
79. kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,
80. and complacently seated himself on the sofa.
81. 
82. "First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind
83. at rest," said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness
84. and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be
85. discerned.
86. 
87. "Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like
88. these if one has any feeling?" said Anna Pavlovna. "You are staying the
89. whole evening, I hope?"
90. 
91. "And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must
92. put in an appearance there," said the prince. "My daughter is coming for
93. me to take me there."
94. 
95. "I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these
96. festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome."
97. 
98. "If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been
99. put off," said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit
100. said things he did not even wish to be believed.
101. 
102. "Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's
103. dispatch? You know everything."
104. 
105. "What can one say about it?" replied the prince in a cold, listless
106. tone. "What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has
107. burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours."
108. 
109. Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale
110. part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years,
111. overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had
112. become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not
113. feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the
114. expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it
115. did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,
116. as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,
117. which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to
118. correct.
119. 
120. In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst
121. out:
122. 
123. "Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand things,
124. but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is
125. betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign
126. recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one
127. thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform
128. the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will
129. not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
130. revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of
131. this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just
132. one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial
133. spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness
134. of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find,
135. and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did
136. Novosiltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot
137. understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for
138. himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they
139. promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not
140. perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and
141. that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a
142. word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian
143. neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty
144. destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!"
145. 
146. She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
147. 
148. "I think," said the prince with a smile, "that if you had been sent
149. instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of
150. Prussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a
151. cup of tea?"
152. 
153. "In a moment. A propos," she added, becoming calm again, "I am expecting
154. two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is
155. connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best
156. French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones. And
157. also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been
158. received by the Emperor. Had you heard?"
159. 
160. "I shall be delighted to meet them," said the prince. "But tell me," he
161. added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,
162. though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his
163. visit, "is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be
164. appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor
165. creature."
166. 
167. Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were
168. trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for the
169. baron.
170. 
171. Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
172. anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was
173. pleased with.
174. 
175. "Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,"
176. was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.
177. 
178. As she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna's face suddenly assumed an
179. expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
180. sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
181. patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke
182. beaucoup d'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.
183. 
184. The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and
185. courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pavlovna wished
186. both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended
187. to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:
188. 
189. "Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came
190. out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly
191. beautiful."
192. 
193. The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.
194. 
195. "I often think," she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to
196. the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political
197. and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
198. conversation--"I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are
199. distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don't
200. speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like him," she added in a tone
201. admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. "Two such charming
202. children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you
203. don't deserve to have them."
204. 
205. And she smiled her ecstatic smile.
206. 
207. "I can't help it," said the prince. "Lavater would have said I lack the
208. bump of paternity."
209. 
210. "Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am
211. dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves" (and her face
212. assumed its melancholy expression), "he was mentioned at Her Majesty's
213. and you were pitied...."
214. 
215. The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
216. awaiting a reply. He frowned.
217. 
218. "What would you have me do?" he said at last. "You know I did all a
219. father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.
220. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That
221. is the only difference between them." He said this smiling in a way more
222. natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth
223. very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.
224. 
225. "And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father
226. there would be nothing I could reproach you with," said Anna Pavlovna,
227. looking up pensively.
228. 
229. "I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my
230. children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That
231. is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!"
232. 
233. He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
234. gesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.
235. 
236. "Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?" she
237. asked. "They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I
238. don't feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is
239. very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary
240. Bolkonskaya."
241. 
242. Prince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and
243. perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of
244. the head that he was considering this information.
245. 
246. "Do you know," he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad
247. current of his thoughts, "that Anatole is costing me forty thousand
248. rubles a year? And," he went on after a pause, "what will it be in five
249. years, if he goes on like this?" Presently he added: "That's what we
250. fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?"
251. 
252. "Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the
253. well-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the
254. late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.' He is very clever
255. but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a
256. brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an
257. aide-de-camp of Kutuzov's and will be here tonight."
258. 
259. "Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pavlovna's
260. hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange that affair for
261. me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as
262. a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good
263. family and that's all I want."
264. 
265. And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the
266. maid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as
267. he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.
268. 
269. "Attendez," said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, "I'll speak to Lise, young
270. Bolkonski's wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be
271. arranged. It shall be on your family's behalf that I'll start my
272. apprenticeship as old maid."
273. 
274. 
275. 
276. 
277. 
278. CHAPTER II
279. 
280. 
281. Anna Pavlovna's drawing room was gradually filling. The highest
282. Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age
283. and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.
284. Prince Vasili's daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her father
285. to the ambassador's entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge
286. as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya, known as la
287. femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg, * was also there. She had been
288. married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to
289. any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince Vasili's son,
290. Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbe Morio
291. and many others had also come.
292. 
293. 
294.      * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.
295. 
296. 
297. To each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, "You have not yet seen my aunt,"
298. or "You do not know my aunt?" and very gravely conducted him or her to
299. a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come
300. sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive;
301. and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pavlovna
302. mentioned each one's name and then left them.
303. 
304. Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
305. one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them
306. cared about; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
307. solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in
308. the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her
309. Majesty, "who, thank God, was better today." And each visitor, though
310. politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a
311. sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return
312. to her the whole evening.
313. 
314. The young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a
315. gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a
316. delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth,
317. but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she
318. occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case
319. with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect--the shortness of her
320. upper lip and her half-open mouth--seemed to be her own special and
321. peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty
322. young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and
323. carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones
324. who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a
325. little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life
326. and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile
327. and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a
328. specially amiable mood that day.
329. 
330. The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying
331. steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat
332. down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a
333. pleasure to herself and to all around her. "I have brought my work,"
334. said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.
335. "Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me," she
336. added, turning to her hostess. "You wrote that it was to be quite a
337. small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed." And she spread
338. out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress,
339. girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.
340. 
341. "Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,"
342. replied Anna Pavlovna.
343. 
344. "You know," said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
345. French, turning to a general, "my husband is deserting me? He is going
346. to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?" she
347. added, addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting for an answer she
348. turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Helene.
349. 
350. "What a delightful woman this little princess is!" said Prince Vasili to
351. Anna Pavlovna.
352. 
353. One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with
354. close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable
355. at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout
356. young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-known
357. grandee of Catherine's time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man
358. had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only
359. just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his
360. first appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted him with the nod she
361. accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of
362. this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight
363. of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face
364. when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than
365. the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to
366. the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which
367. distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.
368. 
369. "It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor
370. invalid," said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt
371. as she conducted him to her.
372. 
373. Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as
374. if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little
375. princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.
376. 
377. Anna Pavlovna's alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the
378. aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty's health. Anna
379. Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words: "Do you know the Abbe
380. Morio? He is a most interesting man."
381. 
382. "Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very
383. interesting but hardly feasible."
384. 
385. "You think so?" rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and
386. get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed
387. a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had
388. finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who
389. wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart,
390. he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbe's plan chimerical.
391. 
392. "We will talk of it later," said Anna Pavlovna with a smile.
393. 
394. And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she
395. resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready
396. to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As
397. the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes
398. round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
399. creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the
400. machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pavlovna moved about her
401. drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a
402. word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,
403. proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about
404. Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached
405. the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and
406. again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe.
407. 
408. Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pavlovna's
409. was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the
410. intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child
411. in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any
412. clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and
413. refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting
414. to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the
415. conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity
416. to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.
417. 
418. 
419. 
420. 
421. 
422. CHAPTER III
423. 
424. 
425. Anna Pavlovna's reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed
426. steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,
427. beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face
428. was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had
429. settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the
430. abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess
431. Helene, Prince Vasili's daughter, and the little Princess Bolkonskaya,
432. very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third
433. group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna.
434. 
435. The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished
436. manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
437. politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
438. which he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a
439. treat to her guests. As a clever maitre d'hotel serves up as a specially
440. choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the
441. kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served up to her
442. guests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly choice
443. morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the
444. murder of the Duc d'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d'Enghien had
445. perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons
446. for Buonaparte's hatred of him.
447. 
448. "Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte," said Anna Pavlovna, with a
449. pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in the sound of
450. that sentence: "Contez nous cela, Vicomte."
451. 
452. The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to
453. comply. Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to
454. listen to his tale.
455. 
456. "The vicomte knew the duc personally," whispered Anna Pavlovna to of
457. the guests. "The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur," said she to another.
458. "How evidently he belongs to the best society," said she to a third;
459. and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most
460. advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot
461. dish.
462. 
463. The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.
464. 
465. "Come over here, Helene, dear," said Anna Pavlovna to the beautiful
466. young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another
467. group.
468. 
469. The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which
470. she had first entered the room--the smile of a perfectly beautiful
471. woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss
472. and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling
473. diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking
474. at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the
475. privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders,
476. back, and bosom--which in the fashion of those days were very much
477. exposed--and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as
478. she moved toward Anna Pavlovna. Helene was so lovely that not only
479. did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even
480. appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She
481. seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.
482. 
483. "How lovely!" said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his
484. shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
485. when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
486. unchanging smile.
487. 
488. "Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience," said he, smilingly
489. inclining his head.
490. 
491. The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered
492. a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was
493. being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,
494. altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more
495. beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time
496. to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story
497. produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna, at once adopted just
498. the expression she saw on the maid of honor's face, and again relapsed
499. into her radiant smile.
500. 
501. The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Helene.
502. 
503. "Wait a moment, I'll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking
504. of?" she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. "Fetch me my workbag."
505. 
506. There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking
507. merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
508. seat.
509. 
510. "Now I am all right," she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she
511. took up her work.
512. 
513. Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and
514. moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.
515. 
516. Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance
517. to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of
518. this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his
519. sister's, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,
520. self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the
521. wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary
522. was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen
523. self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and
524. mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms
525. and legs always fell into unnatural positions.
526. 
527. "It's not going to be a ghost story?" said he, sitting down beside
528. the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this
529. instrument he could not begin to speak.
530. 
531. "Why no, my dear fellow," said the astonished narrator, shrugging his
532. shoulders.
533. 
534. "Because I hate ghost stories," said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which
535. showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had
536. uttered them.
537. 
538. He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure
539. whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in
540. a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
541. effrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.
542. 
543. The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,
544. to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit
545. Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also
546. enjoyed the famous actress' favors, and that in his presence Napoleon
547. happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject,
548. and was thus at the duc's mercy. The latter spared him, and this
549. magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.
550. 
551. The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point
552. where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked
553. agitated.
554. 
555. "Charming!" said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little
556. princess.
557. 
558. "Charming!" whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her
559. work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
560. prevented her from going on with it.
561. 
562. The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
563. prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept a
564. watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was
565. talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe, so she hurried to the
566. rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about
567. the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young
568. man's simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were
569. talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna
570. Pavlovna disapproved.
571. 
572. "The means are... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the
573. people," the abbe was saying. "It is only necessary for one powerful
574. nation like Russia--barbaric as she is said to be--to place herself
575. disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the
576. maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the
577. world!"
578. 
579. "But how are you to get that balance?" Pierre was beginning.
580. 
581. At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,
582. asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian's
583. face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary
584. expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.
585. 
586. "I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
587. society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had
588. the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of
589. the climate," said he.
590. 
591. Not letting the abbe and Pierre escape, Anna Pavlovna, the more
592. conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the
593. larger circle.
594. 
595. 
596. 
597. 
598. 
599. CHAPTER IV
600. 
601. 
602. Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew
603. Bolkonski, the little princess' husband. He was a very handsome young
604. man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about
605. him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,
606. offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was
607. evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had
608. found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to
609. them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed
610. to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her
611. with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pavlovna's
612. hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.
613. 
614. "You are off to the war, Prince?" said Anna Pavlovna.
615. 
616. "General Kutuzov," said Bolkonski, speaking French and stressing the
617. last syllable of the general's name like a Frenchman, "has been pleased
618. to take me as an aide-de-camp...."
619. 
620. "And Lise, your wife?"
621. 
622. "She will go to the country."
623. 
624. "Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?"
625. 
626. "Andre," said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish
627. manner in which she spoke to other men, "the vicomte has been telling us
628. such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!"
629. 
630. Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from
631. the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,
632. affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round
633. Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was
634. touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre's beaming face he gave him an
635. unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.
636. 
637. "There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?" said he to Pierre.
638. 
639. "I knew you would be here," replied Pierre. "I will come to supper with
640. you. May I?" he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte
641. who was continuing his story.
642. 
643. "No, impossible!" said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre's
644. hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to
645. say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasili and his daughter
646. got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.
647. 
648. "You must excuse me, dear Vicomte," said Prince Vasili to the Frenchman,
649. holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising.
650. "This unfortunate fete at the ambassador's deprives me of a pleasure,
651. and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your
652. enchanting party," said he, turning to Anna Pavlovna.
653. 
654. His daughter, Princess Helene, passed between the chairs, lightly
655. holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more
656. radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,
657. almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.
658. 
659. "Very lovely," said Prince Andrew.
660. 
661. "Very," said Pierre.
662. 
663. In passing Prince Vasili seized Pierre's hand and said to Anna Pavlovna:
664. "Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month
665. and this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so
666. necessary for a young man as the society of clever women."
667. 
668. Anna Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his
669. father to be a connection of Prince Vasili's. The elderly lady who had
670. been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasili
671. in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed had
672. left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and
673. fear.
674. 
675. "How about my son Boris, Prince?" said she, hurrying after him into the
676. anteroom. "I can't remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I
677. may take back to my poor boy."
678. 
679. Although Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to
680. the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an
681. ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go
682. away.
683. 
684. "What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would
685. be transferred to the Guards at once?" said she.
686. 
687. "Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can," answered Prince
688. Vasili, "but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should advise
689. you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn. That would be the
690. best way."
691. 
692. The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya, belonging to one of the
693. best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of
694. society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to
695. Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.
696. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had obtained an
697. invitation to Anna Pavlovna's reception and had sat listening to the
698. vicomte's story. Prince Vasili's words frightened her, an embittered
699. look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she
700. smiled again and clutched Prince Vasili's arm more tightly.
701. 
702. "Listen to me, Prince," said she. "I have never yet asked you for
703. anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my
704. father's friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God's sake to
705. do this for my son--and I shall always regard you as a benefactor," she
706. added hurriedly. "No, don't be angry, but promise! I have asked Golitsyn
707. and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were," she said,
708. trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.
709. 
710. "Papa, we shall be late," said Princess Helene, turning her beautiful
711. head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood
712. waiting by the door.
713. 
714. Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized
715. if it is to last. Prince Vasili knew this, and having once realized that
716. if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable
717. to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But in
718. Princess Drubetskaya's case he felt, after her second appeal, something
719. like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was quite true;
720. he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career.
721. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those
722. women--mostly mothers--who, having once made up their minds, will not
723. rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary
724. to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make
725. scenes. This last consideration moved him.
726. 
727. "My dear Anna Mikhaylovna," said he with his usual familiarity and
728. weariness of tone, "it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask;
729. but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father's memory,
730. I will do the impossible--your son shall be transferred to the Guards.
731. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?"
732. 
733. "My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you--I knew your
734. kindness!" He turned to go.
735. 
736. "Wait--just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards..." she
737. faltered. "You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich Kutuzov...
738. recommend Boris to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and
739. then..."
740. 
741. Prince Vasili smiled.
742. 
743. "No, I won't promise that. You don't know how Kutuzov is pestered since
744. his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all the
745. Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants."
746. 
747. "No, but do promise! I won't let you go! My dear benefactor..."
748. 
749. "Papa," said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, "we
750. shall be late."
751. 
752. "Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?"
753. 
754. "Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?"
755. 
756. "Certainly; but about Kutuzov, I don't promise."
757. 
758. "Do promise, do promise, Vasili!" cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went,
759. with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came
760. naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.
761. 
762. Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed
763. all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face
764. resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the
765. group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to
766. listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was
767. accomplished.
768. 
769. 
770. 
771. 
772. 
773. CHAPTER V
774. 
775. 
776. "And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?"
777. asked Anna Pavlovna, "and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and
778. Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur
779. Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the
780. nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one's head whirl! It is as if
781. the whole world had gone crazy."
782. 
783. Prince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic
784. smile.
785. 
786. "'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!' * They say he was very fine
787. when he said that," he remarked, repeating the words in Italian: "'Dio
788. mi l'ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!'"
789. 
790. 
791.      * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!
792. 
793. 
794. "I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
795. over," Anna Pavlovna continued. "The sovereigns will not be able to
796. endure this man who is a menace to everything."
797. 
798. "The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia," said the vicomte, polite but
799. hopeless: "The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XVII,
800. for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!" and he became more
801. animated. "And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal
802. of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors
803. to compliment the usurper."
804. 
805. And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.
806. 
807. Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
808. through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the
809. little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Conde
810. coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity
811. as if she had asked him to do it.
812. 
813. "Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d'azur--maison Conde," said he.
814. 
815. The princess listened, smiling.
816. 
817. "If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer," the
818. vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which
819. he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but
820. follows the current of his own thoughts, "things will have gone too far.
821. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society--I mean
822. good French society--will have been forever destroyed, and then..."
823. 
824. He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to
825. make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pavlovna,
826. who had him under observation, interrupted:
827. 
828. "The Emperor Alexander," said she, with the melancholy which always
829. accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, "has declared
830. that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their
831. own form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper,
832. the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its
833. rightful king," she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist
834. emigrant.
835. 
836. "That is doubtful," said Prince Andrew. "Monsieur le Vicomte quite
837. rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will
838. be difficult to return to the old regime."
839. 
840. "From what I have heard," said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the
841. conversation, "almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
842. Bonaparte's side."
843. 
844. "It is the Buonapartists who say that," replied the vicomte without
845. looking at Pierre. "At the present time it is difficult to know the real
846. state of French public opinion."
847. 
848. "Bonaparte has said so," remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile.
849. 
850. It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
851. remarks at him, though without looking at him.
852. 
853. "'I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,'" Prince
854. Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon's words.
855. "'I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.' I do not know how far
856. he was justified in saying so."
857. 
858. "Not in the least," replied the vicomte. "After the murder of the
859. duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some
860. people," he went on, turning to Anna Pavlovna, "he ever was a hero,
861. after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
862. hero less on earth."
863. 
864. Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation
865. of the vicomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and
866. though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she
867. was unable to stop him.
868. 
869. "The execution of the Duc d'Enghien," declared Monsieur Pierre, "was a
870. political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness
871. of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of
872. that deed."
873. 
874. "Dieu! Mon Dieu!" muttered Anna Pavlovna in a terrified whisper.
875. 
876. "What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows
877. greatness of soul?" said the little princess, smiling and drawing her
878. work nearer to her.
879. 
880. "Oh! Oh!" exclaimed several voices.
881. 
882. "Capital!" said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee
883. with the palm of his hand.
884. 
885. The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his
886. audience over his spectacles and continued.
887. 
888. "I say so," he continued desperately, "because the Bourbons fled
889. from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone
890. understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,
891. he could not stop short for the sake of one man's life."
892. 
893. "Won't you come over to the other table?" suggested Anna Pavlovna.
894. 
895. But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.
896. 
897. "No," cried he, becoming more and more eager, "Napoleon is great because
898. he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all
899. that was good in it--equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and
900. of the press--and only for that reason did he obtain power."
901. 
902. "Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit
903. murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called him
904. a great man," remarked the vicomte.
905. 
906. "He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might rid
907. them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man. The
908. Revolution was a grand thing!" continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by
909. this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his
910. wish to express all that was in his mind.
911. 
912. "What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But
913. won't you come to this other table?" repeated Anna Pavlovna.
914. 
915. "Rousseau's Contrat social," said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.
916. 
917. "I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas."
918. 
919. "Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide," again interjected an
920. ironical voice.
921. 
922. "Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important.
923. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices,
924. and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained
925. in full force."
926. 
927. "Liberty and equality," said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last
928. deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were,
929. "high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love
930. liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality.
931. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We
932. wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it."
933. 
934. Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the
935. vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of
936. Pierre's outburst Anna Pavlovna, despite her social experience, was
937. horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words had
938. not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was
939. impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
940. a vigorous attack on the orator.
941. 
942. "But, my dear Monsieur Pierre," said she, "how do you explain the fact
943. of a great man executing a duc--or even an ordinary man who--is innocent
944. and untried?"
945. 
946. "I should like," said the vicomte, "to ask how monsieur explains the
947. 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at
948. all like the conduct of a great man!"
949. 
950. "And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!" said the
951. little princess, shrugging her shoulders.
952. 
953. "He's a low fellow, say what you will," remarked Prince Hippolyte.
954. 
955. Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His
956. smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,
957. his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by
958. another--a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to
959. ask forgiveness.
960. 
961. The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that
962. this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were
963. silent.
964. 
965. "How do you expect him to answer you all at once?" said Prince Andrew.
966. "Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between
967. his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor. So it
968. seems to me."
969. 
970. "Yes, yes, of course!" Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this
971. reinforcement.
972. 
973. "One must admit," continued Prince Andrew, "that Napoleon as a man was
974. great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he
975. gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but... but there are other acts
976. which it is difficult to justify."
977. 
978. Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
979. Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
980. go.
981. 
982. Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,
983. and asking them all to be seated began:
984. 
985. "I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.
986. Excuse me, Vicomte--I must tell it in Russian or the point will be
987. lost...." And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian
988. as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.
989. Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
990. attention to his story.
991. 
992. "There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must
993. have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her
994. taste. And she had a lady's maid, also big. She said..."
995. 
996. Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with
997. difficulty.
998. 
999. "She said... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the maid, 'put on a livery,
1000. get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.'"
1001. 
1002. Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
1003. audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several
1004. persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pavlovna, did however
1005. smile.
1006. 
1007. "She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and
1008. her long hair came down...." Here he could contain himself no longer and
1009. went on, between gasps of laughter: "And the whole world knew...."
1010. 
1011. And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told
1012. it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pavlovna and the
1013. others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's social tact in so agreeably ending
1014. Pierre's unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote the
1015. conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and
1016. next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and
1017. where.
1018. 
1019. 
1020. 
1021. 
1022. 
1023. CHAPTER VI
1024. 
1025. 
1026. Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began
1027. to take their leave.
1028. 
1029. Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge
1030. red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing
1031. room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something
1032. particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was
1033. absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the
1034. general's three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till
1035. the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and
1036. inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by
1037. his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna Pavlovna turned toward
1038. him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his
1039. indiscretion, nodded and said: "I hope to see you again, but I also hope
1040. you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre."
1041. 
1042. When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody
1043. saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, "Opinions are
1044. opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am." And
1045. everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, felt this.
1046. 
1047. Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders
1048. to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened
1049. indifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also
1050. come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant
1051. princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.
1052. 
1053. "Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold," said the little princess,
1054. taking leave of Anna Pavlovna. "It is settled," she added in a low
1055. voice.
1056. 
1057. Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she
1058. contemplated between Anatole and the little princess' sister-in-law.
1059. 
1060. "I rely on you, my dear," said Anna Pavlovna, also in a low tone.
1061. "Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au
1062. revoir!"--and she left the hall.
1063. 
1064. Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face
1065. close to her, began to whisper something.
1066. 
1067. Two footmen, the princess' and his own, stood holding a shawl and a
1068. cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to
1069. the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of
1070. understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual
1071. spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.
1072. 
1073. "I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador's," said Prince Hippolyte
1074. "-so dull-. It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!"
1075. 
1076. "They say the ball will be very good," replied the princess, drawing up
1077. her downy little lip. "All the pretty women in society will be there."
1078. 
1079. "Not all, for you will not be there; not all," said Prince Hippolyte
1080. smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he
1081. even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from
1082. awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the
1083. shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as
1084. though embracing her.
1085. 
1086. Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her
1087. husband. Prince Andrew's eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he
1088. seem.
1089. 
1090. "Are you ready?" he asked his wife, looking past her.
1091. 
1092. Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion
1093. reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch
1094. following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.
1095. 
1096. "Princesse, au revoir," cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well as
1097. with his feet.
1098. 
1099. The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark
1100. carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under
1101. pretense of helping, was in everyone's way.
1102. 
1103. "Allow me, sir," said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable
1104. tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.
1105. 
1106. "I am expecting you, Pierre," said the same voice, but gently and
1107. affectionately.
1108. 
1109. The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte
1110. laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
1111. whom he had promised to take home.
1112. 
1113. "Well, mon cher," said the vicomte, having seated himself beside
1114. Hippolyte in the carriage, "your little princess is very nice, very nice
1115. indeed, quite French," and he kissed the tips of his fingers. Hippolyte
1116. burst out laughing.
1117. 
1118. "Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,"
1119. continued the vicomte. "I pity the poor husband, that little officer who
1120. gives himself the airs of a monarch."
1121. 
1122. Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, "And you were
1123. saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to
1124. know how to deal with them."
1125. 
1126. 
1127. Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew's study like
1128. one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took
1129. from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesar's
1130. Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.
1131. 
1132. "What have you done to Mlle Scherer? She will be quite ill now," said
1133. Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands.
1134. 
1135. Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager
1136. face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.
1137. 
1138. "That abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
1139. right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but--I do not
1140. know how to express it... not by a balance of political power...."
1141. 
1142. It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract
1143. conversation.
1144. 
1145. "One can't everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have you
1146. at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a
1147. diplomatist?" asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.
1148. 
1149. Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.
1150. 
1151. "Really, I don't yet know. I don't like either the one or the other."
1152. 
1153. "But you must decide on something! Your father expects it."
1154. 
1155. Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor,
1156. and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow
1157. his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man, "Now go to
1158. Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to
1159. anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasili, and here is money. Write to
1160. me all about it, and I will help you in everything." Pierre had
1161. already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided
1162. on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.
1163. Pierre rubbed his forehead.
1164. 
1165. "But he must be a Freemason," said he, referring to the abbe whom he had
1166. met that evening.
1167. 
1168. "That is all nonsense." Prince Andrew again interrupted him, "let us
1169. talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?"
1170. 
1171. "No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to
1172. tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for
1173. freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army;
1174. but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is
1175. not right."
1176. 
1177. Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre's childish words. He
1178. put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense,
1179. but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than
1180. the one Prince Andrew gave to this naive question.
1181. 
1182. "If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,"
1183. he said.
1184. 
1185. "And that would be splendid," said Pierre.
1186. 
1187. Prince Andrew smiled ironically.
1188. 
1189. "Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about..."
1190. 
1191. "Well, why are you going to the war?" asked Pierre.
1192. 
1193. "What for? I don't know. I must. Besides that I am going..." He paused.
1194. "I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!"
1195. 
1196. 
1197. 
1198. 
1199. 
1200. CHAPTER VII
1201. 
1202. 
1203. The rustle of a woman's dress was heard in the next room. Prince Andrew
1204. shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had
1205. in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa.
1206. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as
1207. fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a
1208. chair for her.
1209. 
1210. "How is it," she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and
1211. fussily in the easy chair, "how is it Annette never got married? How
1212. stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so,
1213. but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you are,
1214. Monsieur Pierre!"
1215. 
1216. "And I am still arguing with your husband. I can't understand why he
1217. wants to go to the war," replied Pierre, addressing the princess with
1218. none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
1219. intercourse with young women.
1220. 
1221. The princess started. Evidently Pierre's words touched her to the quick.
1222. 
1223. "Ah, that is just what I tell him!" said she. "I don't understand it; I
1224. don't in the least understand why men can't live without wars. How is
1225. it that we women don't want anything of the kind, don't need it? Now
1226. you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is Uncle's
1227. aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well known, so much
1228. appreciated by everyone. The other day at the Apraksins' I heard a lady
1229. asking, 'Is that the famous Prince Andrew?' I did indeed." She laughed.
1230. "He is so well received everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp
1231. to the Emperor. You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously.
1232. Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?"
1233. 
1234. Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the
1235. conversation, gave no reply.
1236. 
1237. "When are you starting?" he asked.
1238. 
1239. "Oh, don't speak of his going, don't! I won't hear it spoken of," said
1240. the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken
1241. to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited
1242. to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member. "Today when I
1243. remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off...
1244. and then you know, Andre..." (she looked significantly at her husband)
1245. "I'm afraid, I'm afraid!" she whispered, and a shudder ran down her
1246. back.
1247. 
1248. Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides
1249. Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of
1250. frigid politeness.
1251. 
1252. "What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don't understand," said he.
1253. 
1254. "There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of
1255. his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in
1256. the country."
1257. 
1258. "With my father and sister, remember," said Prince Andrew gently.
1259. 
1260. "Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to be
1261. afraid."
1262. 
1263. Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a
1264. joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she
1265. felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the
1266. gist of the matter lay in that.
1267. 
1268. "I still can't understand what you are afraid of," said Prince Andrew
1269. slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.
1270. 
1271. The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.
1272. 
1273. "No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have..."
1274. 
1275. "Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier," said Prince Andrew. "You
1276. had better go."
1277. 
1278. The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.
1279. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.
1280. 
1281. Pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise, now at him and
1282. now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.
1283. 
1284. "Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?" exclaimed the little
1285. princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful
1286. grimace. "I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed
1287. so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no
1288. pity for me. Why is it?"
1289. 
1290. "Lise!" was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an
1291. entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself
1292. regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:
1293. 
1294. "You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave
1295. like that six months ago?"
1296. 
1297. "Lise, I beg you to desist," said Prince Andrew still more emphatically.
1298. 
1299. Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
1300. all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the
1301. sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.
1302. 
1303. "Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because... I assure you
1304. I myself have experienced... and so... because... No, excuse me!
1305. An outsider is out of place here... No, don't distress yourself...
1306. Good-by!"
1307. 
1308. Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.
1309. 
1310. "No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the
1311. pleasure of spending the evening with you."
1312. 
1313. "No, he thinks only of himself," muttered the princess without
1314. restraining her angry tears.
1315. 
1316. "Lise!" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which
1317. indicates that patience is exhausted.
1318. 
1319. Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess' pretty
1320. face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes
1321. glanced askance at her husband's face, and her own assumed the timid,
1322. deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
1323. drooping tail.
1324. 
1325. "Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!" she muttered, and lifting her dress with one hand
1326. she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.
1327. 
1328. "Good night, Lise," said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as
1329. he would have done to a stranger.
1330. 
1331. 
1332. 
1333. 
1334. 
1335. CHAPTER VIII
1336. 
1337. 
1338. The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre
1339. continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead
1340. with his small hand.
1341. 
1342. "Let us go and have supper," he said with a sigh, going to the door.
1343. 
1344. They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.
1345. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore
1346. that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.
1347. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,
1348. with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on
1349. his face, began to talk--as one who has long had something on his mind
1350. and suddenly determines to speak out.
1351. 
1352. "Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's my advice: never marry till
1353. you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and
1354. until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen
1355. her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
1356. mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing--or all that is
1357. good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles.
1358. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with such surprise. If you marry
1359. expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every
1360. step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing
1361. room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an
1362. idiot!... But what's the good?..." and he waved his arm.
1363. 
1364. Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and
1365. the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend
1366. in amazement.
1367. 
1368. "My wife," continued Prince Andrew, "is an excellent woman, one of those
1369. rare women with whom a man's honor is safe; but, O God, what would I
1370. not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I
1371. mention this, because I like you."
1372. 
1373. As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkonski who
1374. had lolled in Anna Pavlovna's easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had
1375. uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face
1376. was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire
1377. of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It
1378. was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more
1379. impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.
1380. 
1381. "You don't understand why I say this," he continued, "but it is the
1382. whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career," said he
1383. (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), "but Bonaparte when he
1384. worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing
1385. but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with
1386. a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you
1387. have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with
1388. regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality--these are
1389. the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war,
1390. the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for
1391. nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit," continued Prince
1392. Andrew, "and at Anna Pavlovna's they listen to me. And that stupid set
1393. without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women... If you only knew
1394. what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right.
1395. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything--that's what women are
1396. when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it
1397. seems as if there were something in them, but there's nothing, nothing,
1398. nothing! No, don't marry, my dear fellow; don't marry!" concluded Prince
1399. Andrew.
1400. 
1401. "It seems funny to me," said Pierre, "that you, you should consider
1402. yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have everything
1403. before you, everything. And you..."
1404. 
1405. He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he
1406. thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.
1407. 
1408. "How can he talk like that?" thought Pierre. He considered his friend
1409. a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest
1410. degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best
1411. described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince
1412. Andrew's calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory,
1413. his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had
1414. an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and
1415. study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew's lack of capacity
1416. for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly
1417. addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of
1418. strength.
1419. 
1420. Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise
1421. and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels
1422. that they may run smoothly.
1423. 
1424. "My part is played out," said Prince Andrew. "What's the use of talking
1425. about me? Let us talk about you," he added after a silence, smiling at
1426. his reassuring thoughts.
1427. 
1428. That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre's face.
1429. 
1430. "But what is there to say about me?" said Pierre, his face relaxing into
1431. a careless, merry smile. "What am I? An illegitimate son!" He suddenly
1432. blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say
1433. this. "Without a name and without means... And it really..." But he
1434. did not say what "it really" was. "For the present I am free and am
1435. all right. Only I haven't the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to
1436. consult you seriously."
1437. 
1438. Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance--friendly and
1439. affectionate as it was--expressed a sense of his own superiority.
1440. 
1441. "I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our
1442. whole set. Yes, you're all right! Choose what you will; it's all the
1443. same. You'll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting
1444. those Kuragins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so badly--all
1445. this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!"
1446. 
1447. "What would you have, my dear fellow?" answered Pierre, shrugging his
1448. shoulders. "Women, my dear fellow; women!"
1449. 
1450. "I don't understand it," replied Prince Andrew. "Women who are comme il
1451. faut, that's a different matter; but the Kuragins' set of women, 'women
1452. and wine' I don't understand!"
1453. 
1454. Pierre was staying at Prince Vasili Kuragin's and sharing the dissipated
1455. life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by
1456. marrying him to Prince Andrew's sister.
1457. 
1458. "Do you know?" said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought,
1459. "seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such a life I
1460. can't decide or think properly about anything. One's head aches, and one
1461. spends all one's money. He asked me for tonight, but I won't go."
1462. 
1463. "You give me your word of honor not to go?"
1464. 
1465. "On my honor!"
1466. 
1467. 
1468. 
1469. 
1470. 
1471. CHAPTER IX
1472. 
1473. 
1474. It was past one o'clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless,
1475. northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive
1476. straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the
1477. impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to
1478. see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning
1479. or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kuragin
1480. was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there
1481. was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre
1482. was very fond of.
1483. 
1484. "I should like to go to Kuragin's," thought he.
1485. 
1486. But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go
1487. there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so
1488. passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
1489. that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his
1490. promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he
1491. had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; "besides,"
1492. thought he, "all such 'words of honor' are conventional things with no
1493. definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may
1494. be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and
1495. dishonor will be all the same!" Pierre often indulged in reflections
1496. of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to
1497. Kuragin's.
1498. 
1499. Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards' barracks, in which
1500. Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs,
1501. and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty
1502. bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of
1503. alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.
1504. 
1505. Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.
1506. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the
1507. remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on
1508. the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of
1509. laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and
1510. general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
1511. round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one
1512. pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.
1513. 
1514. "I bet a hundred on Stevens!" shouted one.
1515. 
1516. "Mind, no holding on!" cried another.
1517. 
1518. "I bet on Dolokhov!" cried a third. "Kuragin, you part our hands."
1519. 
1520. "There, leave Bruin alone; here's a bet on."
1521. 
1522. "At one draught, or he loses!" shouted a fourth.
1523. 
1524. "Jacob, bring a bottle!" shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who
1525. stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen
1526. shirt unfastened in front. "Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here is Petya!
1527. Good man!" cried he, addressing Pierre.
1528. 
1529. Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,
1530. particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring,
1531. cried from the window: "Come here; part the bets!" This was Dolokhov,
1532. an officer of the Semenov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who
1533. was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.
1534. 
1535. "I don't understand. What's it all about?"
1536. 
1537. "Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here," said Anatole, taking a
1538. glass from the table he went up to Pierre.
1539. 
1540. "First of all you must drink!"
1541. 
1542. Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at
1543. the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening
1544. to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre's glass while
1545. explaining that Dolokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval
1546. officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
1547. of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.
1548. 
1549. "Go on, you must drink it all," said Anatole, giving Pierre the last
1550. glass, "or I won't let you go!"
1551. 
1552. "No, I won't," said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the
1553. window.
1554. 
1555. Dolokhov was holding the Englishman's hand and clearly and distinctly
1556. repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to
1557. Anatole and Pierre.
1558. 
1559. Dolokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He
1560. was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache,
1561. so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly
1562. seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle
1563. of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm
1564. lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually
1565. round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute,
1566. insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it
1567. impossible not to notice his face. Dolokhov was a man of small means and
1568. no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles,
1569. Dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that
1570. all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him more than
1571. they did Anatole. Dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won.
1572. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kuragin
1573. and Dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces
1574. of Petersburg.
1575. 
1576. The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone
1577. from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who
1578. were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
1579. the gentlemen around.
1580. 
1581. Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to
1582. smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but
1583. could not move it. He smashed a pane.
1584. 
1585. "You have a try, Hercules," said he, turning to Pierre.
1586. 
1587. Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with
1588. a crash.
1589. 
1590. "Take it right out, or they'll think I'm holding on," said Dolokhov.
1591. 
1592. "Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?" said Anatole.
1593. 
1594. "First-rate," said Pierre, looking at Dolokhov, who with a bottle of rum
1595. in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky,
1596. the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.
1597. 
1598. Dolokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window
1599. sill. "Listen!" cried he, standing there and addressing those in the
1600. room. All were silent.
1601. 
1602. "I bet fifty imperials"--he spoke French that the Englishman might
1603. understand him, but he did, not speak it very well--"I bet fifty
1604. imperials... or do you wish to make it a hundred?" added he, addressing
1605. the Englishman.
1606. 
1607. "No, fifty," replied the latter.
1608. 
1609. "All right. Fifty imperials... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum
1610. without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this
1611. spot" (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window)
1612. "and without holding on to anything. Is that right?"
1613. 
1614. "Quite right," said the Englishman.
1615. 
1616. Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons
1617. of his coat and looking down at him--the Englishman was short--began
1618. repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.
1619. 
1620. "Wait!" cried Dolokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to
1621. attract attention. "Wait a bit, Kuragin. Listen! If anyone else does the
1622. same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?"
1623. 
1624. The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to
1625. accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though
1626. he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating
1627. Dolokhov's words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life
1628. Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill,
1629. leaned over, and looked down.
1630. 
1631. "Oh! Oh! Oh!" he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of
1632. the pavement.
1633. 
1634. "Shut up!" cried Dolokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad
1635. jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.
1636. 
1637. Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,
1638. Dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his
1639. legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on
1640. his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to
1641. the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed
1642. them on the window sill, though it was already quite light. Dolokhov's
1643. back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both
1644. sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front. Pierre
1645. stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others present,
1646. suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize
1647. hold of Dolokhov's shirt.
1648. 
1649. "I say, this is folly! He'll be killed," said this more sensible man.
1650. 
1651. Anatole stopped him.
1652. 
1653. "Don't touch him! You'll startle him and then he'll be killed. Eh?...
1654. What then?... Eh?"
1655. 
1656. Dolokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged
1657. himself on his seat.
1658. 
1659. "If anyone comes meddling again," said he, emitting the words separately
1660. through his thin compressed lips, "I will throw him down there. Now
1661. then!"
1662. 
1663. Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle
1664. and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand
1665. to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
1666. broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
1667. window and from Dolokhov's back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes.
1668. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had
1669. wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself
1670. on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a
1671. faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror
1672. and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dolokhov
1673. still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back
1674. till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the
1675. bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The
1676. bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head
1677. tilting yet further back. "Why is it so long?" thought Pierre. It seemed
1678. to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dolokhov made
1679. a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this
1680. was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping
1681. ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more
1682. with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill, but
1683. refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he
1684. would never open them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around.
1685. He looked up: Dolokhov was standing on the window sill, with a pale but
1686. radiant face.
1687. 
1688. "It's empty."
1689. 
1690. He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. Dolokhov
1691. jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.
1692. 
1693. "Well done!... Fine fellow!... There's a bet for you!... Devil take
1694. you!" came from different sides.
1695. 
1696. The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.
1697. Dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the window
1698. sill.
1699. 
1700. "Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I'll do the same thing!" he
1701. suddenly cried. "Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a
1702. bottle. I'll do it.... Bring a bottle!"
1703. 
1704. "Let him do it, let him do it," said Dolokhov, smiling.
1705. 
1706. "What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go
1707. giddy even on a staircase," exclaimed several voices.
1708. 
1709. "I'll drink it! Let's have a bottle of rum!" shouted Pierre, banging the
1710. table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out
1711. of the window.
1712. 
1713. They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who
1714. touched him was sent flying.
1715. 
1716. "No, you'll never manage him that way," said Anatole. "Wait a bit and
1717. I'll get round him.... Listen! I'll take your bet tomorrow, but now we
1718. are all going to ----'s."
1719. 
1720. "Come on then," cried Pierre. "Come on!... And we'll take Bruin with
1721. us."
1722. 
1723. And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,
1724. and began dancing round the room with it.
1725. 
1726. 
1727. 
1728. 
1729. 
1730. CHAPTER X
1731. 
1732. 
1733. Prince Vasili kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskaya who
1734. had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Boris on the evening of Anna
1735. Pavlovna's soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception
1736. made, and Boris transferred into the regiment of Semenov Guards with the
1737. rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment to Kutuzov's staff
1738. despite all Anna Mikhaylovna's endeavors and entreaties. Soon after
1739. Anna Pavlovna's reception Anna Mikhaylovna returned to Moscow and went
1740. straight to her rich relations, the Rostovs, with whom she stayed when
1741. in the town and where her darling Bory, who had only just entered a
1742. regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards
1743. as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a
1744. time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and
1745. her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them
1746. on the march to Radzivilov.
1747. 
1748. It was St. Natalia's day and the name day of two of the Rostovs--the
1749. mother and the youngest daughter--both named Nataly. Ever since
1750. the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going
1751. continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostova's big house on
1752. the Povarskaya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and
1753. her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing-room with the visitors
1754. who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in
1755. relays.
1756. 
1757. The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type
1758. of face, evidently worn out with childbearing--she had had twelve.
1759. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a
1760. distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikhaylovna
1761. Drubetskaya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the
1762. drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young
1763. people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to
1764. take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw
1765. them off, inviting them all to dinner.
1766. 
1767. "I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher," or "ma chere"--he called
1768. everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his
1769. tone, "my dear," whether they were above or below him in rank--"I thank
1770. you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping.
1771. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended, ma chere! On
1772. behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!" These words he
1773. repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and with the same
1774. expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the same firm
1775. pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As soon as he
1776. had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the
1777. drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out
1778. his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who
1779. enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity,
1780. offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health,
1781. sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident
1782. French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment
1783. of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray
1784. hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his
1785. way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and
1786. pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were being set
1787. out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in
1788. silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he
1789. would call Dmitri Vasilevich, a man of good family and the manager of
1790. all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table
1791. would say: "Well, Dmitri, you'll see that things are all as they should
1792. be? That's right! The great thing is the serving, that's it." And with a
1793. complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.
1794. 
1795. "Marya Lvovna Karagina and her daughter!" announced the countess'
1796. gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The
1797. countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with
1798. her husband's portrait on it.
1799. 
1800. "I'm quite worn out by these callers. However, I'll see her and no more.
1801. She is so affected. Ask her in," she said to the footman in a sad voice,
1802. as if saying: "Very well, finish me off."
1803. 
1804. A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling
1805. daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.
1806. 
1807. "Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child...
1808. at the Razumovski's ball... and Countess Apraksina... I was so
1809. delighted..." came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting
1810. one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping
1811. of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last out until,
1812. at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say,
1813. "I am so delighted... Mamma's health... and Countess Apraksina..." and
1814. then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles,
1815. and drive away. The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the
1816. illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine's day, Count
1817. Bezukhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved
1818. so improperly at Anna Pavlovna's reception.
1819. 
1820. "I am so sorry for the poor count," said the visitor. "He is in such bad
1821. health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!"
1822. 
1823. "What is that?" asked the countess as if she did not know what the
1824. visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of
1825. Count Bezukhov's distress some fifteen times.
1826. 
1827. "That's what comes of a modern education," exclaimed the visitor. "It
1828. seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he
1829. liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things
1830. that he has been expelled by the police."
1831. 
1832. "You don't say so!" replied the countess.
1833. 
1834. "He chose his friends badly," interposed Anna Mikhaylovna. "Prince
1835. Vasili's son, he, and a certain Dolokhov have, it is said, been up to
1836. heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it. Dolokhov
1837. has been degraded to the ranks and Bezukhov's son sent back to Moscow.
1838. Anatole Kuragin's father managed somehow to get his son's affair hushed
1839. up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg."
1840. 
1841. "But what have they been up to?" asked the countess.
1842. 
1843. "They are regular brigands, especially Dolokhov," replied the visitor.
1844. "He is a son of Marya Ivanovna Dolokhova, such a worthy woman, but
1845. there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a
1846. carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried
1847. to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and
1848. the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there
1849. was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back!"
1850. 
1851. "What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!" shouted the
1852. count, dying with laughter.
1853. 
1854. "Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?"
1855. 
1856. Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.
1857. 
1858. "It was all they could do to rescue the poor man," continued the
1859. visitor. "And to think it is Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov's son who
1860. amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well
1861. educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has done for
1862. him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in spite of his
1863. money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have
1864. my daughters to consider."
1865. 
1866. "Why do you say this young man is so rich?" asked the countess, turning
1867. away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention. "His
1868. children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is illegitimate."
1869. 
1870. The visitor made a gesture with her hand.
1871. 
1872. "I should think he has a score of them."
1873. 
1874. Princess Anna Mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently
1875. wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in
1876. society.
1877. 
1878. "The fact of the matter is," said she significantly, and also in a half
1879. whisper, "everyone knows Count Cyril's reputation.... He has lost count
1880. of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite."
1881. 
1882. "How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!" remarked the
1883. countess. "I have never seen a handsomer man."
1884. 
1885. "He is very much altered now," said Anna Mikhaylovna. "Well, as I was
1886. saying, Prince Vasili is the next heir through his wife, but the count
1887. is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the
1888. Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death--and he is so
1889. ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from
1890. Petersburg--no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre
1891. or Prince Vasili. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know
1892. it all very well for Prince Vasili told me himself. Besides, Cyril
1893. Vladimirovich is my mother's second cousin. He's also my Bory's
1894. godfather," she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the
1895. fact.
1896. 
1897. "Prince Vasili arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on some
1898. inspection business," remarked the visitor.
1899. 
1900. "Yes, but between ourselves," said the princess, "that is a pretext. The
1901. fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladimirovich, hearing how ill he
1902. is."
1903. 
1904. "But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke," said the count; and
1905. seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the young
1906. ladies. "I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!"
1907. 
1908. And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form
1909. again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats
1910. well and, in particular, drinks well. "So do come and dine with us!" he
1911. said.
1912. 
1913. 
1914. 
1915. 
1916. 
1917. CHAPTER XI
1918. 
1919. 
1920. Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,
1921. but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now
1922. rose and took their leave. The visitor's daughter was already smoothing
1923. down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from
1924. the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to
1925. the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen,
1926. hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and
1927. stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident that she had
1928. not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway
1929. appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards,
1930. a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.
1931. 
1932. The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide
1933. and threw them round the little girl who had run in.
1934. 
1935. "Ah, here she is!" he exclaimed laughing. "My pet, whose name day it is.
1936. My dear pet!"
1937. 
1938. "Ma chere, there is a time for everything," said the countess with
1939. feigned severity. "You spoil her, Ilya," she added, turning to her
1940. husband.
1941. 
1942. "How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name
1943. day," said the visitor. "What a charming child," she added, addressing
1944. the mother.
1945. 
1946. This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life--with
1947. childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her
1948. bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs
1949. in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers--was just at that
1950. charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not
1951. yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her
1952. flushed face in the lace of her mother's mantilla--not paying the least
1953. attention to her severe remark--and began to laugh. She laughed, and in
1954. fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced
1955. from the folds of her frock.
1956. 
1957. "Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see..." was all Natasha managed
1958. to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against her mother
1959. and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim
1960. visitor could not help joining in.
1961. 
1962. "Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you," said the mother,
1963. pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the
1964. visitor she added: "She is my youngest girl."
1965. 
1966. Natasha, raising her face for a moment from her mother's mantilla,
1967. glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.
1968. 
1969. The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it
1970. necessary to take some part in it.
1971. 
1972. "Tell me, my dear," said she to Natasha, "is Mimi a relation of yours? A
1973. daughter, I suppose?"
1974. 
1975. Natasha did not like the visitor's tone of condescension to childish
1976. things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.
1977. 
1978. Meanwhile the younger generation: Boris, the officer, Anna Mikhaylovna's
1979. son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count's eldest son; Sonya, the
1980. count's fifteen-year-old niece, and little Petya, his youngest boy,
1981. had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to
1982. restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that
1983. shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms, from which they
1984. had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing
1985. than the drawing-room talk of society scandals, the weather, and
1986. Countess Apraksina. Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly
1987. able to suppress their laughter.
1988. 
1989. The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood,
1990. were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Boris
1991. was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate
1992. features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression.
1993. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face
1994. expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered
1995. the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but
1996. failed. Boris on the contrary at once found his footing, and related
1997. quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was
1998. still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged
1999. during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked
2000. right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at Natasha. She
2001. turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was
2002. screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable
2003. to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as
2004. fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. Boris did not laugh.
2005. 
2006. "You were meaning to go out, weren't you, Mamma? Do you want the
2007. carriage?" he asked his mother with a smile.
2008. 
2009. "Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready," she answered, returning
2010. his smile.
2011. 
2012. Boris quietly left the room and went in search of Natasha. The plump
2013. boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been
2014. disturbed.
2015. 
2016. 
2017. 
2018. 
2019. 
2020. CHAPTER XII
2021. 
2022. 
2023. The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the
2024. young lady visitor and the countess' eldest daughter (who was four years
2025. older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were
2026. Nicholas and Sonya, the niece. Sonya was a slender little brunette with
2027. a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black
2028. plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion
2029. and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular
2030. arms and neck. By the grace of her movements, by the softness and
2031. flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of
2032. manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises
2033. to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it proper to
2034. show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite
2035. of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who
2036. was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that
2037. her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it
2038. was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more
2039. energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like
2040. Natasha and Boris, escape from the drawing room.
2041. 
2042. "Ah yes, my dear," said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing
2043. to Nicholas, "his friend Boris has become an officer, and so for
2044. friendship's sake he is leaving the university and me, his old father,
2045. and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a place
2046. and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn't that
2047. friendship?" remarked the count in an inquiring tone.
2048. 
2049. "But they say that war has been declared," replied the visitor.
2050. 
2051. "They've been saying so a long while," said the count, "and they'll say
2052. so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My dear, there's
2053. friendship for you," he repeated. "He's joining the hussars."
2054. 
2055. The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.
2056. 
2057. "It's not at all from friendship," declared Nicholas, flaring up and
2058. turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. "It is not from friendship
2059. at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation."
2060. 
2061. He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both
2062. regarding him with a smile of approbation.
2063. 
2064. "Schubert, the colonel of the Pavlograd Hussars, is dining with us
2065. today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with
2066. him. It can't be helped!" said the count, shrugging his shoulders and
2067. speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.
2068. 
2069. "I have already told you, Papa," said his son, "that if you don't wish
2070. to let me go, I'll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in the
2071. army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.--I don't know how to
2072. hide what I feel." As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness
2073. of a handsome youth at Sonya and the young lady visitor.
2074. 
2075. The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment
2076. to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.
2077. 
2078. "All right, all right!" said the old count. "He always flares up! This
2079. Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he rose
2080. from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it," he added,
2081. not noticing his visitor's sarcastic smile.
2082. 
2083. The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karagina turned to young
2084. Rostov.
2085. 
2086. "What a pity you weren't at the Arkharovs' on Thursday. It was so dull
2087. without you," said she, giving him a tender smile.
2088. 
2089. The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish
2090. smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation
2091. without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart
2092. of Sonya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk
2093. he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and
2094. hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile
2095. on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholas' animation
2096. vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then
2097. with a distressed face left the room to find Sonya.
2098. 
2099. "How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their
2100. sleeves!" said Anna Mikhaylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.
2101. "Cousinage--dangereux voisinage;" * she added.
2102. 
2103. 
2104.      * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.
2105. 
2106. 
2107. "Yes," said the countess when the brightness these young people had
2108. brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no
2109. one had put but which was always in her mind, "and how much suffering,
2110. how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in
2111. them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is
2112. always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both
2113. for girls and boys."
2114. 
2115. "It all depends on the bringing up," remarked the visitor.
2116. 
2117. "Yes, you're quite right," continued the countess. "Till now I have
2118. always, thank God, been my children's friend and had their full
2119. confidence," said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who
2120. imagine that their children have no secrets from them. "I know I shall
2121. always be my daughters' first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his
2122. impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can't help it), he will
2123. all the same never be like those Petersburg young men."
2124. 
2125. "Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters," chimed in the count, who
2126. always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that
2127. everything was splendid. "Just fancy: wants to be an hussar. What's one
2128. to do, my dear?"
2129. 
2130. "What a charming creature your younger girl is," said the visitor; "a
2131. little volcano!"
2132. 
2133. "Yes, a regular volcano," said the count. "Takes after me! And what a
2134. voice she has; though she's my daughter, I tell the truth when I say
2135. she'll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an Italian to
2136. give her lessons."
2137. 
2138. "Isn't she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train it
2139. at that age."
2140. 
2141. "Oh no, not at all too young!" replied the count. "Why, our mothers used
2142. to be married at twelve or thirteen."
2143. 
2144. "And she's in love with Boris already. Just fancy!" said the countess
2145. with a gentle smile, looking at Boris' and went on, evidently concerned
2146. with a thought that always occupied her: "Now you see if I were to be
2147. severe with her and to forbid it... goodness knows what they might be up
2148. to on the sly" (she meant that they would be kissing), "but as it is,
2149. I know every word she utters. She will come running to me of her own
2150. accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but
2151. really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter."
2152. 
2153. "Yes, I was brought up quite differently," remarked the handsome elder
2154. daughter, Countess Vera, with a smile.
2155. 
2156. But the smile did not enhance Vera's beauty as smiles generally do;
2157. on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,
2158. expression. Vera was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning,
2159. was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was
2160. true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone--the visitors and
2161. countess alike--turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said
2162. it, and they all felt awkward.
2163. 
2164. "People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make
2165. something exceptional of them," said the visitor.
2166. 
2167. "What's the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too
2168. clever with Vera," said the count. "Well, what of that? She's turned out
2169. splendidly all the same," he added, winking at Vera.
2170. 
2171. The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.
2172. 
2173. "What manners! I thought they would never go," said the countess, when
2174. she had seen her guests out.
2175. 
2176. 
2177. 
2178. 
2179. 
2180. CHAPTER XIII
2181. 
2182. 
2183. When Natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the
2184. conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation
2185. in the drawing room, waiting for Boris to come out. She was already
2186. growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming
2187. at once, when she heard the young man's discreet steps approaching
2188. neither quickly nor slowly. At this Natasha dashed swiftly among the
2189. flower tubs and hid there.
2190. 
2191. Boris paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little
2192. dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined
2193. his handsome face. Natasha, very still, peered out from her ambush,
2194. waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the
2195. glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Natasha was about
2196. to call him but changed her mind. "Let him look for me," thought she.
2197. Hardly had Boris gone than Sonya, flushed, in tears, and muttering
2198. angrily, came in at the other door. Natasha checked her first impulse to
2199. run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching--as under an
2200. invisible cap--to see what went on in the world. She was experiencing
2201. a new and peculiar pleasure. Sonya, muttering to herself, kept looking
2202. round toward the drawing-room door. It opened and Nicholas came in.
2203. 
2204. "Sonya, what is the matter with you? How can you?" said he, running up
2205. to her.
2206. 
2207. "It's nothing, nothing; leave me alone!" sobbed Sonya.
2208. 
2209. "Ah, I know what it is."
2210. 
2211. "Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!"
2212. 
2213. "So-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that,
2214. for a mere fancy?" said Nicholas taking her hand.
2215. 
2216. Sonya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natasha, not stirring
2217. and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes.
2218. "What will happen now?" thought she.
2219. 
2220. "Sonya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are everything!"
2221. said Nicholas. "And I will prove it to you."
2222. 
2223. "I don't like you to talk like that."
2224. 
2225. "Well, then, I won't; only forgive me, Sonya!" He drew her to him and
2226. kissed her.
2227. 
2228. "Oh, how nice," thought Natasha; and when Sonya and Nicholas had gone
2229. out of the conservatory she followed and called Boris to her.
2230. 
2231. "Boris, come here," said she with a sly and significant look. "I
2232. have something to tell you. Here, here!" and she led him into the
2233. conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.
2234. 
2235. Boris followed her, smiling.
2236. 
2237. "What is the something?" asked he.
2238. 
2239. She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown
2240. down on one of the tubs, picked it up.
2241. 
2242. "Kiss the doll," said she.
2243. 
2244. Boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not
2245. reply.
2246. 
2247. "Don't you want to? Well, then, come here," said she, and went further
2248. in among the plants and threw down the doll. "Closer, closer!" she
2249. whispered.
2250. 
2251. She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and
2252. fear appeared on her flushed face.
2253. 
2254. "And me? Would you like to kiss me?" she whispered almost inaudibly,
2255. glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from
2256. excitement.
2257. 
2258. Boris blushed.
2259. 
2260. "How funny you are!" he said, bending down to her and blushing still
2261. more, but he waited and did nothing.
2262. 
2263. Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so
2264. that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing
2265. back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.
2266. 
2267. Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs
2268. and stood, hanging her head.
2269. 
2270. "Natasha," he said, "you know that I love you, but..."
2271. 
2272. "You are in love with me?" Natasha broke in.
2273. 
2274. "Yes, I am, but please don't let us do like that.... In another four
2275. years... then I will ask for your hand."
2276. 
2277. Natasha considered.
2278. 
2279. "Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen," she counted on her slender
2280. little fingers. "All right! Then it's settled?"
2281. 
2282. A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.
2283. 
2284. "Settled!" replied Boris.
2285. 
2286. "Forever?" said the little girl. "Till death itself?"
2287. 
2288. She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining
2289. sitting room.
2290. 
2291. 
2292. 
2293. 
2294. 
2295. CHAPTER XIV
2296. 
2297. 
2298. After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave
2299. orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite
2300. to dinner all who came "to congratulate." The countess wished to have
2301. a tete-a-tete talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna
2302. Mikhaylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from
2303. Petersburg. Anna Mikhaylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face, drew
2304. her chair nearer to that of the countess.
2305. 
2306. "With you I will be quite frank," said Anna Mikhaylovna. "There are not
2307. many left of us old friends! That's why I so value your friendship."
2308. 
2309. Anna Mikhaylovna looked at Vera and paused. The countess pressed her
2310. friend's hand.
2311. 
2312. "Vera," she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
2313. favorite, "how is it you have so little tact? Don't you see you are not
2314. wanted here? Go to the other girls, or..."
2315. 
2316. The handsome Vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.
2317. 
2318. "If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone," she replied as
2319. she rose to go to her own room.
2320. 
2321. But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting,
2322. one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. Sonya was
2323. sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the
2324. first he had ever written. Boris and Natasha were at the other window
2325. and ceased talking when Vera entered. Sonya and Natasha looked at Vera
2326. with guilty, happy faces.
2327. 
2328. It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but
2329. apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Vera.
2330. 
2331. "How often have I asked you not to take my things?" she said. "You have
2332. a room of your own," and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.
2333. 
2334. "In a minute, in a minute," he said, dipping his pen.
2335. 
2336. "You always manage to do things at the wrong time," continued Vera.
2337. "You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of
2338. you."
2339. 
2340. Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one
2341. replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the
2342. room with the inkstand in her hand.
2343. 
2344. "And at your age what secrets can there be between Natasha and Boris, or
2345. between you two? It's all nonsense!"
2346. 
2347. "Now, Vera, what does it matter to you?" said Natasha in defense,
2348. speaking very gently.
2349. 
2350. She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
2351. everyone.
2352. 
2353. "Very silly," said Vera. "I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!"
2354. 
2355. "All have secrets of their own," answered Natasha, getting warmer. "We
2356. don't interfere with you and Berg."
2357. 
2358. "I should think not," said Vera, "because there can never be anything
2359. wrong in my behavior. But I'll just tell Mamma how you are behaving with
2360. Boris."
2361. 
2362. "Natalya Ilynichna behaves very well to me," remarked Boris. "I have
2363. nothing to complain of."
2364. 
2365. "Don't, Boris! You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome," said
2366. Natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly. (She used the word
2367. "diplomat," which was just then much in vogue among the children, in the
2368. special sense they attached to it.) "Why does she bother me?" And she
2369. added, turning to Vera, "You'll never understand it, because you've
2370. never loved anyone. You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis
2371. and nothing more" (this nickname, bestowed on Vera by Nicholas,
2372. was considered very stinging), "and your greatest pleasure is to be
2373. unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please," she
2374. finished quickly.
2375. 
2376. "I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors..."
2377. 
2378. "Well, now you've done what you wanted," put in Nicholas--"said
2379. unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let's go to the nursery."
2380. 
2381. All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.
2382. 
2383. "The unpleasant things were said to me," remarked Vera, "I said none to
2384. anyone."
2385. 
2386. "Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!" shouted laughing voices through
2387. the door.
2388. 
2389. The handsome Vera, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect
2390. on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been said to her,
2391. went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf. Looking at
2392. her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer.
2393. 
2394. 
2395. In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.
2396. 
2397. "Ah, my dear," said the countess, "my life is not all roses either.
2398. Don't I know that at the rate we are living our means won't last long?
2399. It's all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the country do we
2400. get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what besides! But
2401. don't let's talk about me; tell me how you managed everything. I often
2402. wonder at you, Annette--how at your age you can rush off alone in a
2403. carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people,
2404. and know how to deal with them all! It's quite astonishing. How did you
2405. get things settled? I couldn't possibly do it."
2406. 
2407. "Ah, my love," answered Anna Mikhaylovna, "God grant you never know
2408. what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love
2409. to distraction! One learns many things then," she added with a certain
2410. pride. "That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those big
2411. people I write a note: 'Princess So-and-So desires an interview with
2412. So and-So,' and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four
2413. times--till I get what I want. I don't mind what they think of me."
2414. 
2415. "Well, and to whom did you apply about Bory?" asked the countess. "You
2416. see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas is
2417. going as a cadet. There's no one to interest himself for him. To whom
2418. did you apply?"
2419. 
2420. "To Prince Vasili. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything,
2421. and put the matter before the Emperor," said Princess Anna Mikhaylovna
2422. enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured
2423. to gain her end.
2424. 
2425. "Has Prince Vasili aged much?" asked the countess. "I have not seen him
2426. since we acted together at the Rumyantsovs' theatricals. I expect he has
2427. forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days," said the countess,
2428. with a smile.
2429. 
2430. "He is just the same as ever," replied Anna Mikhaylovna, "overflowing
2431. with amiability. His position has not turned his head at all. He said to
2432. me, 'I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess. I am at
2433. your command.' Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation.
2434. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his
2435. happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now
2436. a terrible one," continued Anna Mikhaylovna, sadly, dropping her voice.
2437. "My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress. Would you
2438. believe it, I have literally not a penny and don't know how to equip
2439. Boris." She took out her handkerchief and began to cry. "I need five
2440. hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble note. I am in such a
2441. state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov.
2442. If he will not assist his godson--you know he is Bory's godfather--and
2443. allow him something for his maintenance, all my trouble will have been
2444. thrown away.... I shall not be able to equip him."
2445. 
2446. The countess' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.
2447. 
2448. "I often think, though, perhaps it's a sin," said the princess, "that
2449. here lives Count Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov so rich, all alone... that
2450. tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It's a burden to him,
2451. and Bory's life is only just beginning...."
2452. 
2453. "Surely he will leave something to Boris," said the countess.
2454. 
2455. "Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish. Still,
2456. I will take Boris and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to him
2457. straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it's really all the
2458. same to me when my son's fate is at stake." The princess rose. "It's now
2459. two o'clock and you dine at four. There will just be time."
2460. 
2461. And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of
2462. time, Anna Mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the
2463. anteroom with him.
2464. 
2465. "Good-by, my dear," said she to the countess who saw her to the door,
2466. and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, "Wish me good
2467. luck."
2468. 
2469. "Are you going to Count Cyril Vladimirovich, my dear?" said the count
2470. coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added: "If
2471. he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the house, you
2472. know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my dear.
2473. We will see how Taras distinguishes himself today. He says Count Orlov
2474. never gave such a dinner as ours will be!"
2475. 
2476. 
2477. 
2478. 
2479. 
2480. CHAPTER XV
2481. 
2482. 
2483. "My dear Boris," said Princess Anna Mikhaylovna to her son as Countess
2484. Rostova's carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw
2485. covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril
2486. Vladimirovich Bezukhov's house. "My dear Boris," said the mother,
2487. drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and
2488. tenderly on her son's arm, "be affectionate and attentive to him. Count
2489. Cyril Vladimirovich is your godfather after all, your future depends on
2490. him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how
2491. to be."
2492. 
2493. "If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it..."
2494. answered her son coldly. "But I have promised and will do it for your
2495. sake."
2496. 
2497. Although the hall porter saw someone's carriage standing at the
2498. entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to
2499. be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
2500. rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady's old
2501. cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and,
2502. hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse
2503. today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.
2504. 
2505. "We may as well go back," said the son in French.
2506. 
2507. "My dear!" exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand on
2508. his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.
2509. 
2510. Boris said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking
2511. off his cloak.
2512. 
2513. "My friend," said Anna Mikhaylovna in gentle tones, addressing the hall
2514. porter, "I know Count Cyril Vladimirovich is very ill... that's why I
2515. have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my friend... I
2516. only need see Prince Vasili Sergeevich: he is staying here, is he not?
2517. Please announce me."
2518. 
2519. The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned
2520. away.
2521. 
2522. "Princess Drubetskaya to see Prince Vasili Sergeevich," he called to a
2523. footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat, who
2524. ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.
2525. 
2526. The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large
2527. Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly
2528. ascended the carpeted stairs.
2529. 
2530. "My dear," she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a touch,
2531. "you promised me!"
2532. 
2533. The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.
2534. 
2535. They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the
2536. apartments assigned to Prince Vasili.
2537. 
2538. Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were
2539. about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they
2540. entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasili
2541. came out--wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast, as
2542. was his custom when at home--taking leave of a good-looking, dark-haired
2543. man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.
2544. 
2545. "Then it is certain?" said the prince.
2546. 
2547. "Prince, humanum est errare, * but..." replied the doctor, swallowing
2548. his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.
2549. 
2550. 
2551.      * To err is human.
2552. 
2553. 
2554. "Very well, very well..."
2555. 
2556. Seeing Anna Mikhaylovna and her son, Prince Vasili dismissed the doctor
2557. with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry. The
2558. son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his
2559. mother's face, and he smiled slightly.
2560. 
2561. "Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our
2562. dear invalid?" said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look
2563. fixed on her.
2564. 
2565. Prince Vasili stared at her and at Boris questioningly and perplexed.
2566. Boris bowed politely. Prince Vasili without acknowledging the bow turned
2567. to Anna Mikhaylovna, answering her query by a movement of the head and
2568. lips indicating very little hope for the patient.
2569. 
2570. "Is it possible?" exclaimed Anna Mikhaylovna. "Oh, how awful! It is
2571. terrible to think.... This is my son," she added, indicating Boris. "He
2572. wanted to thank you himself."
2573. 
2574. Boris bowed again politely.
2575. 
2576. "Believe me, Prince, a mother's heart will never forget what you have
2577. done for us."
2578. 
2579. "I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikhaylovna,"
2580. said Prince Vasili, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner,
2581. here in Moscow to Anna Mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an
2582. obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done
2583. in Petersburg at Anna Scherer's reception.
2584. 
2585. "Try to serve well and show yourself worthy," added he, addressing Boris
2586. with severity. "I am glad.... Are you here on leave?" he went on in his
2587. usual tone of indifference.
2588. 
2589. "I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency," replied
2590. Boris, betraying neither annoyance at the prince's brusque manner nor
2591. a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly and
2592. respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.
2593. 
2594. "Are you living with your mother?"
2595. 
2596. "I am living at Countess Rostova's," replied Boris, again adding, "your
2597. excellency."
2598. 
2599. "That is, with Ilya Rostov who married Nataly Shinshina," said Anna
2600. Mikhaylovna.
2601. 
2602. "I know, I know," answered Prince Vasili in his monotonous voice.
2603. "I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that
2604. unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too,
2605. I am told."
2606. 
2607. "But a very kind man, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylovna with a pathetic
2608. smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostov deserved this censure,
2609. but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. "What do the
2610. doctors say?" asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again
2611. expressing deep sorrow.
2612. 
2613. "They give little hope," replied the prince.
2614. 
2615. "And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me and
2616. Boris. He is his godson," she added, her tone suggesting that this fact
2617. ought to give Prince Vasili much satisfaction.
2618. 
2619. Prince Vasili became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikhaylovna saw that
2620. he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezukhov's fortune,
2621. and hastened to reassure him.
2622. 
2623. "If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle," said
2624. she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, "I know
2625. his character: noble, upright... but you see he has no one with him
2626. except the young princesses.... They are still young...." She bent
2627. her head and continued in a whisper: "Has he performed his final duty,
2628. Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no
2629. worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill. We
2630. women, Prince," and she smiled tenderly, "always know how to say these
2631. things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for me. I
2632. am used to suffering."
2633. 
2634. Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had
2635. done at Anna Pavlovna's, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna
2636. Mikhaylovna.
2637. 
2638. "Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikhaylovna?"
2639. said he. "Let us wait until evening. The doctors are expecting a
2640. crisis."
2641. 
2642. "But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the
2643. welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a
2644. Christian..."
2645. 
2646. A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the
2647. count's niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her body
2648. was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vasili turned
2649. to her.
2650. 
2651. "Well, how is he?"
2652. 
2653. "Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise..." said the
2654. princess, looking at Anna Mikhaylovna as at a stranger.
2655. 
2656. "Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you," said Anna Mikhaylovna with a happy
2657. smile, ambling lightly up to the count's niece. "I have come, and am at
2658. your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you have gone
2659. through," and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.
2660. 
2661. The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as
2662. Anna Mikhaylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had
2663. conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasili to take a
2664. seat beside her.
2665. 
2666. "Boris," she said to her son with a smile, "I shall go in to see the
2667. count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile
2668. and don't forget to give him the Rostovs' invitation. They ask him to
2669. dinner. I suppose he won't go?" she continued, turning to the prince.
2670. 
2671. "On the contrary," replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed,
2672. "I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man.... Here
2673. he is, and the count has not once asked for him."
2674. 
2675. He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Boris down one flight of
2676. stairs and up another, to Pierre's rooms.
2677. 
2678. 
2679. 
2680. 
2681. 
2682. CHAPTER XVI
2683. 
2684. 
2685. Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in
2686. Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
2687. sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostov's was true.
2688. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been
2689. for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father's house.
2690. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known
2691. in Moscow and that the ladies about his father--who were never favorably
2692. disposed toward him--would have used it to turn the count against him,
2693. he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father's part of
2694. the house. Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most
2695. of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at
2696. embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was
2697. reading--the one who had met Anna Mikhaylovna. The two younger ones were
2698. embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that
2699. one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier. Pierre
2700. was received as if he were a corpse or a leper. The eldest princess
2701. paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes;
2702. the second assumed precisely the same expression; while the youngest,
2703. the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition,
2704. bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene
2705. she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely
2706. able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the
2707. pattern.
2708. 
2709. "How do you do, cousin?" said Pierre. "You don't recognize me?"
2710. 
2711. "I recognize you only too well, too well."
2712. 
2713. "How is the count? Can I see him?" asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but
2714. unabashed.
2715. 
2716. "The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have
2717. done your best to increase his mental sufferings."
2718. 
2719. "Can I see the count?" Pierre again asked.
2720. 
2721. "Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see
2722. him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle's beef tea is ready--it is almost
2723. time," she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and
2724. busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only
2725. busy causing him annoyance.
2726. 
2727. Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and
2728. said: "Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see
2729. him."
2730. 
2731. And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the
2732. sister with the mole.
2733. 
2734. Next day Prince Vasili had arrived and settled in the count's house. He
2735. sent for Pierre and said to him: "My dear fellow, if you are going to
2736. behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that is
2737. all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must not
2738. see him at all."
2739. 
2740. Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in
2741. his rooms upstairs.
2742. 
2743. When Boris appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room,
2744. stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,
2745. as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely
2746. over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering
2747. indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.
2748. 
2749. "England is done for," said he, scowling and pointing his finger at
2750. someone unseen. "Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights
2751. of man, is sentenced to..." But before Pierre--who at that moment
2752. imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the
2753. dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London--could
2754. pronounce Pitt's sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome young
2755. officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left Moscow when Boris
2756. was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual
2757. impulsive and hearty way he took Boris by the hand with a friendly
2758. smile.
2759. 
2760. "Do you remember me?" asked Boris quietly with a pleasant smile. "I have
2761. come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well."
2762. 
2763. "Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him," answered
2764. Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.
2765. 
2766. Boris felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it
2767. necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least
2768. embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.
2769. 
2770. "Count Rostov asks you to come to dinner today," said he, after a
2771. considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.
2772. 
2773. "Ah, Count Rostov!" exclaimed Pierre joyfully. "Then you are his son,
2774. Ilya? Only fancy, I didn't know you at first. Do you remember how we
2775. went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It's such an age..."
2776. 
2777. "You are mistaken," said Boris deliberately, with a bold and slightly
2778. sarcastic smile. "I am Boris, son of Princess Anna Mikhaylovna
2779. Drubetskaya. Rostov, the father, is Ilya, and his son is Nicholas. I
2780. never knew any Madame Jacquot."
2781. 
2782. Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.
2783. 
2784. "Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I've mixed everything up. One has so
2785. many relatives in Moscow! So you are Boris? Of course. Well, now we
2786. know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?
2787. The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the
2788. Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve
2789. doesn't make a mess of things!"
2790. 
2791. Boris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the
2792. papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve's name.
2793. 
2794. "We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
2795. than with politics," said he in his quiet ironical tone. "I know nothing
2796. about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy with
2797. gossip," he continued. "Just now they are talking about you and your
2798. father."
2799. 
2800. Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion's
2801. sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.
2802. But Boris spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into
2803. Pierre's eyes.
2804. 
2805. "Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip," Boris went on. "Everybody
2806. is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune, though he may
2807. perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will..."
2808. 
2809. "Yes, it is all very horrid," interrupted Pierre, "very horrid."
2810. 
2811. Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
2812. something disconcerting to himself.
2813. 
2814. "And it must seem to you," said Boris flushing slightly, but not
2815. changing his tone or attitude, "it must seem to you that everyone is
2816. trying to get something out of the rich man?"
2817. 
2818. "So it does," thought Pierre.
2819. 
2820. "But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are quite
2821. mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are very
2822. poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your
2823. father is rich, I don't regard myself as a relation of his, and neither
2824. I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him."
2825. 
2826. For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped
2827. up from the sofa, seized Boris under the elbow in his quick, clumsy
2828. way, and, blushing far more than Boris, began to speak with a feeling of
2829. mingled shame and vexation.
2830. 
2831. "Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know
2832. very well..."
2833. 
2834. But Boris again interrupted him.
2835. 
2836. "I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You
2837. must excuse me," said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put
2838. at ease by him, "but I hope I have not offended you. I always make it
2839. a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to
2840. dinner at the Rostovs'?"
2841. 
2842. And Boris, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and
2843. extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,
2844. became quite pleasant again.
2845. 
2846. "No, but I say," said Pierre, calming down, "you are a wonderful fellow!
2847. What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you don't know me.
2848. We have not met for such a long time... not since we were children. You
2849. might think that I... I understand, quite understand. I could not have
2850. done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but it's splendid. I
2851. am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It's queer," he added after
2852. a pause, "that you should have suspected me!" He began to laugh. "Well,
2853. what of it! I hope we'll get better acquainted," and he pressed Boris'
2854. hand. "Do you know, I have not once been in to see the count. He has not
2855. sent for me.... I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?"
2856. 
2857. "And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?" asked
2858. Boris with a smile.
2859. 
2860. Pierre saw that Boris wished to change the subject, and being of the
2861. same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
2862. Boulogne expedition.
2863. 
2864. A footman came in to summon Boris--the princess was going. Pierre, in
2865. order to make Boris' better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner,
2866. and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles
2867. into Boris' eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down
2868. the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with
2869. his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant,
2870. intelligent, and resolute young man.
2871. 
2872. As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely
2873. life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up
2874. his mind that they would be friends.
2875. 
2876. Prince Vasili saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes
2877. and her face was tearful.
2878. 
2879. "It is dreadful, dreadful!" she was saying, "but cost me what it may I
2880. shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be left
2881. like this. Every moment is precious. I can't think why his nieces put
2882. it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!... Adieu,
2883. Prince! May God support you..."
2884. 
2885. "Adieu, ma bonne," answered Prince Vasili turning away from her.
2886. 
2887. "Oh, he is in a dreadful state," said the mother to her son when they
2888. were in the carriage. "He hardly recognizes anybody."
2889. 
2890. "I don't understand, Mamma--what is his attitude to Pierre?" asked the
2891. son.
2892. 
2893. "The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it."
2894. 
2895. "But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?"
2896. 
2897. "Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!"
2898. 
2899. "Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma..."
2900. 
2901. "Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!" exclaimed the mother.
2902. 
2903. 
2904. 
2905. 
2906. 
2907. CHAPTER XVII
2908. 
2909. 
2910. After Anna Mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril
2911. Vladimirovich Bezukhov, Countess Rostova sat for a long time all alone
2912. applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.
2913. 
2914. "What is the matter with you, my dear?" she said crossly to the maid who
2915. kept her waiting some minutes. "Don't you wish to serve me? Then I'll
2916. find you another place."
2917. 
2918. The countess was upset by her friend's sorrow and humiliating poverty,
2919. and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always
2920. found expression in calling her maid "my dear" and speaking to her with
2921. exaggerated politeness.
2922. 
2923. "I am very sorry, ma'am," answered the maid.
2924. 
2925. "Ask the count to come to me."
2926. 
2927. The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as
2928. usual.
2929. 
2930. "Well, little countess? What a saute of game au madere we are to have,
2931. my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Taras were not
2932. ill-spent. He is worth it!"
2933. 
2934. He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling
2935. his gray hair.
2936. 
2937. "What are your commands, little countess?"
2938. 
2939. "You see, my dear... What's that mess?" she said, pointing to his
2940. waistcoat. "It's the saute, most likely," she added with a smile. "Well,
2941. you see, Count, I want some money."
2942. 
2943. Her face became sad.
2944. 
2945. "Oh, little countess!"... and the count began bustling to get out his
2946. pocketbook.
2947. 
2948. "I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles," and taking out
2949. her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband's waistcoat.
2950. 
2951. "Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who's there?" he called out in a
2952. tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush
2953. to obey the summons. "Send Dmitri to me!"
2954. 
2955. Dmitri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count's
2956. house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.
2957. 
2958. "This is what I want, my dear fellow," said the count to the deferential
2959. young man who had entered. "Bring me..." he reflected a moment, "yes,
2960. bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don't bring me such
2961. tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones for the
2962. countess."
2963. 
2964. "Yes, Dmitri, clean ones, please," said the countess, sighing deeply.
2965. 
2966. "When would you like them, your excellency?" asked Dmitri. "Allow me to
2967. inform you... But, don't be uneasy," he added, noticing that the count
2968. was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of
2969. approaching anger. "I was forgetting... Do you wish it brought at once?"
2970. 
2971. "Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess."
2972. 
2973. "What a treasure that Dmitri is," added the count with a smile when
2974. the young man had departed. "There is never any 'impossible' with him.
2975. That's a thing I hate! Everything is possible."
2976. 
2977. "Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world," said
2978. the countess. "But I am in great need of this sum."
2979. 
2980. "You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift," said the count,
2981. and having kissed his wife's hand he went back to his study.
2982. 
2983. When Anna Mikhaylovna returned from Count Bezukhov's the money, all
2984. in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess'
2985. little table, and Anna Mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating
2986. her.
2987. 
2988. "Well, my dear?" asked the countess.
2989. 
2990. "Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so
2991. ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word..."
2992. 
2993. "Annette, for heaven's sake don't refuse me," the countess began, with a
2994. blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and
2995. she took the money from under the handkerchief.
2996. 
2997. Anna Mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready
2998. to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.
2999. 
3000. "This is for Boris from me, for his outfit."
3001. 
3002. Anna Mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess
3003. wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were
3004. kindhearted, and because they--friends from childhood--had to think
3005. about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....
3006. But those tears were pleasant to them both.
3007. 
3008. 
3009. 
3010. 
3011. 
3012. CHAPTER XVIII
3013. 
3014. 
3015. Countess Rostova, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was
3016. already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into
3017. his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes.
3018. From time to time he went out to ask: "Hasn't she come yet?" They were
3019. expecting Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, known in society as le terrible
3020. dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for common
3021. sense and frank plainness of speech. Marya Dmitrievna was known to the
3022. Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities
3023. wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told good
3024. stories about her, while none the less all without exception respected
3025. and feared her.
3026. 
3027. In the count's room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of war
3028. that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the recruiting. None
3029. of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew it had appeared.
3030. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and
3031. talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head first to one
3032. side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure
3033. and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he egged on
3034. against each other.
3035. 
3036. One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled
3037. face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable
3038. young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,
3039. having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the
3040. smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,
3041. Shinshin, a cousin of the countess', a man with "a sharp tongue" as they
3042. said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his companion.
3043. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed,
3044. brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with
3045. red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome
3046. mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semenov
3047. regiment with whom Boris was to travel to join the army, and about
3048. whom Natasha had, teased her elder sister Vera, speaking of Berg as her
3049. "intended." The count sat between them and listened attentively. His
3050. favorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very
3051. fond of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting
3052. two loquacious talkers at one another.
3053. 
3054. "Well, then, old chap, mon tres honorable Alphonse Karlovich," said
3055. Shinshin, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian
3056. expressions with the choicest French phrases--which was a peculiarity of
3057. his speech. "Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l'etat; * you want
3058. to make something out of your company?"
3059. 
3060. 
3061.      * You expect to make an income out of the government.
3062. 
3063. 
3064. "No, Peter Nikolaevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry the
3065. advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own
3066. position now, Peter Nikolaevich..."
3067. 
3068. Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His
3069. conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm
3070. and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
3071. on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put
3072. out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as
3073. soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk
3074. circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.
3075. 
3076. "Consider my position, Peter Nikolaevich. Were I in the cavalry I should
3077. get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even with the
3078. rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty," said
3079. he, looking at Shinshin and the count with a joyful, pleasant smile,
3080. as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief
3081. desire of everyone else.
3082. 
3083. "Besides that, Peter Nikolaevich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall
3084. be in a more prominent position," continued Berg, "and vacancies occur
3085. much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think what can be
3086. done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a little
3087. aside and to send something to my father," he went on, emitting a smoke
3088. ring.
3089. 
3090. "La balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the
3091. proverb says," remarked Shinshin, moving his pipe to the other side of
3092. his mouth and winking at the count.
3093. 
3094. 
3095.       * So that squares matters.
3096. 
3097. 
3098. The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinshin was
3099. talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference,
3100. continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already
3101. gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime
3102. the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company,
3103. might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in
3104. the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently
3105. enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others,
3106. too, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily
3107. sedate, and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that he
3108. disarmed his hearers.
3109. 
3110. "Well, my boy, you'll get along wherever you go--foot or horse--that
3111. I'll warrant," said Shinshin, patting him on the shoulder and taking his
3112. feet off the sofa.
3113. 
3114. Berg smiled joyously. The count, by his guests, went into the drawing
3115. room.
3116. 
3117. It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests,
3118. expecting the summons to zakuska, * avoid engaging in any long
3119. conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order
3120. to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and
3121. hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another,
3122. and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are
3123. waiting for--some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish
3124. that is not yet ready.
3125. 
3126. 
3127.      * Hors d'oeuvres.
3128. 
3129. 
3130. Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the
3131. middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across,
3132. blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk, but
3133. he went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if in search
3134. of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He was in
3135. the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of the
3136. guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at
3137. this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest fellow
3138. could have played such a prank on a policeman.
3139. 
3140. "You have only lately arrived?" the countess asked him.
3141. 
3142. "Oui, madame," replied he, looking around him.
3143. 
3144. "You have not yet seen my husband?"
3145. 
3146. "Non, madame." He smiled quite inappropriately.
3147. 
3148. "You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it's very
3149. interesting."
3150. 
3151. "Very interesting."
3152. 
3153. The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhaylovna. The latter
3154. understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and
3155. sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he
3156. answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other
3157. guests were all conversing with one another. "The Razumovskis... It was
3158. charming... You are very kind... Countess Apraksina..." was heard on all
3159. sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.
3160. 
3161. "Marya Dmitrievna?" came her voice from there.
3162. 
3163. "Herself," came the answer in a rough voice, and Marya Dmitrievna
3164. entered the room.
3165. 
3166. All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
3167. oldest rose. Marya Dmitrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,
3168. holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood
3169. surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if
3170. rolling them up. Marya Dmitrievna always spoke in Russian.
3171. 
3172. "Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her
3173. children," she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all
3174. others. "Well, you old sinner," she went on, turning to the count who
3175. was kissing her hand, "you're feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay? Nowhere
3176. to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just see how
3177. these nestlings are growing up," and she pointed to the girls. "You must
3178. look for husbands for them whether you like it or not...."
3179. 
3180. "Well," said she, "how's my Cossack?" (Marya Dmitrievna always called
3181. Natasha a Cossack) and she stroked the child's arm as she came up
3182. fearless and gay to kiss her hand. "I know she's a scamp of a girl, but
3183. I like her."
3184. 
3185. She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,
3186. having given them to the rosy Natasha, who beamed with the pleasure
3187. of her saint's-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to
3188. Pierre.
3189. 
3190. "Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit," said she, assuming a soft high tone
3191. of voice. "Come here, my friend..." and she ominously tucked up her
3192. sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a childlike
3193. way through his spectacles.
3194. 
3195. "Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell
3196. your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it's my
3197. evident duty." She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to
3198. follow, for this was dearly only a prelude.
3199. 
3200. "A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed and
3201. he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame, sir,
3202. for shame! It would be better if you went to the war."
3203. 
3204. She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep
3205. from laughing.
3206. 
3207. "Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?" said Marya Dmitrievna.
3208. 
3209. The count went in first with Marya Dmitrievna, the countess followed
3210. on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because
3211. Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikhaylovna
3212. with Shinshin. Berg gave his arm to Vera. The smiling Julie Karagina
3213. went in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the
3214. whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses
3215. followed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the
3216. band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their
3217. places. Then the strains of the count's household band were replaced by
3218. the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the soft
3219. steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with
3220. Marya Dmitrievna on her right and Anna Mikhaylovna on her left, the
3221. other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count,
3222. with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshin and the other male
3223. visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the
3224. grownup young people: Vera beside Berg, and Pierre beside Boris; and on
3225. the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind the
3226. crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife
3227. and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his
3228. neighbors' glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn,
3229. without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from
3230. behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed
3231. by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the
3232. ladies' end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the
3233. men's end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the
3234. colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so
3235. much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg
3236. with tender smiles was saying to Vera that love is not an earthly but a
3237. heavenly feeling. Boris was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests
3238. were and exchanging glances with Natasha, who was sitting opposite.
3239. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a great deal.
3240. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the
3241. game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines. These latter
3242. the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind
3243. the next man's shoulders and whispered: "Dry Madeira"... "Hungarian"...
3244. or "Rhine wine" as the case might be. Of the four crystal glasses
3245. engraved with the count's monogram that stood before his plate,
3246. Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with
3247. ever-increasing amiability at the other guests. Natasha, who sat
3248. opposite, was looking at Boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they
3249. are in love with and have just kissed for the first time. Sometimes that
3250. same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl's look made
3251. him inclined to laugh without knowing why.
3252. 
3253. Nicholas sat at some distance from Sonya, beside Julie Karagina, to
3254. whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sonya wore
3255. a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned
3256. pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas
3257. and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round
3258. uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the
3259. children. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines,
3260. and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner
3261. to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler
3262. with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to
3263. appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because
3264. no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from
3265. greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for
3266. knowledge.
3267. 
3268. 
3269. 
3270. 
3271. 
3272. CHAPTER XIX
3273. 
3274. 
3275. At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. The
3276. colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in
3277. Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been
3278. forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.
3279. 
3280. "And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?" remarked Shinshin.
3281. "He has stopped Austria's cackle and I fear it will be our turn next."
3282. 
3283. The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to
3284. the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshin's remark.
3285. 
3286. "It is for the reasson, my goot sir," said he, speaking with a German
3287. accent, "for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He declares in ze
3288. manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening
3289. Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity
3290. of its alliances..." he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as
3291. if in it lay the gist of the matter.
3292. 
3293. Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
3294. repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:
3295. 
3296. ... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor's sole and absolute
3297. aim--to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations--has now decided
3298. him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition
3299. for the attainment of that purpose.
3300. 
3301. "Zat, my dear sir, is vy..." he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine
3302. with dignity and looking to the count for approval.
3303. 
3304. "Connaissez-vous le Proverbe: * 'Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but turn
3305. spindles at home!'?" said Shinshin, puckering his brows and smiling.
3306. "Cela nous convient a merveille.*(2) Suvorov now--he knew what he was
3307. about; yet they beat him a plate couture,*(3) and where are we to find
3308. Suvorovs now? Je vous demande un peu,"*(4) said he, continually changing
3309. from French to Russian.
3310. 
3311. 
3312.      *Do you know the proverb?
3313. 
3314.      *(2) That suits us down to the ground.
3315. 
3316.      *(3) Hollow.
3317. 
3318.      *(4) I just ask you that.
3319. 
3320. 
3321. "Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!" said the colonel,
3322. thumping the table; "and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill
3323. pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible"... he dwelt
3324. particularly on the word possible... "as po-o-ossible," he ended, again
3325. turning to the count. "Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and zere's
3326. an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you
3327. judge of it?" he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the
3328. war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears
3329. intent on the colonel.
3330. 
3331. "I am quite of your opinion," replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his
3332. plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and
3333. desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger.
3334. "I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer," he concluded,
3335. conscious--as were others--after the words were uttered that his remarks
3336. were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore
3337. awkward.
3338. 
3339. "What you said just now was splendid!" said his partner Julie.
3340. 
3341. Sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down
3342. to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.
3343. 
3344. Pierre listened to the colonel's speech and nodded approvingly.
3345. 
3346. "That's fine," said he.
3347. 
3348. "The young man's a real hussar!" shouted the colonel, again thumping the
3349. table.
3350. 
3351. "What are you making such a noise about over there?" Marya Dmitrievna's
3352. deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table. "What are
3353. you thumping the table for?" she demanded of the hussar, "and why are
3354. you exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?"
3355. 
3356. "I am speaking ze truce," replied the hussar with a smile.
3357. 
3358. "It's all about the war," the count shouted down the table. "You know my
3359. son's going, Marya Dmitrievna? My son is going."
3360. 
3361. "I have four sons in the army but still I don't fret. It is all in
3362. God's hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle,"
3363. replied Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice, which easily carried the whole
3364. length of the table.
3365. 
3366. "That's true!"
3367. 
3368. Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladies' at the one end and
3369. the men's at the other.
3370. 
3371. "You won't ask," Natasha's little brother was saying; "I know you won't
3372. ask!"
3373. 
3374. "I will," replied Natasha.
3375. 
3376. Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half
3377. rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what
3378. was coming, and turning to her mother:
3379. 
3380. "Mamma!" rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,
3381. audible the whole length of the table.
3382. 
3383. "What is it?" asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her daughter's
3384. face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly with a
3385. threatening and forbidding movement of her head.
3386. 
3387. The conversation was hushed.
3388. 
3389. "Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?" and Natasha's voice sounded
3390. still more firm and resolute.
3391. 
3392. The countess tried to frown, but could not. Marya Dmitrievna shook her
3393. fat finger.
3394. 
3395. "Cossack!" she said threateningly.
3396. 
3397. Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the
3398. elders.
3399. 
3400. "You had better take care!" said the countess.
3401. 
3402. "Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?" Natasha again cried boldly,
3403. with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in good part.
3404. 
3405. Sonya and fat little Petya doubled up with laughter.
3406. 
3407. "You see! I have asked," whispered Natasha to her little brother and to
3408. Pierre, glancing at him again.
3409. 
3410. "Ice pudding, but you won't get any," said Marya Dmitrievna.
3411. 
3412. Natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
3413. Marya Dmitrievna.
3414. 
3415. "Marya Dmitrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don't like ice cream."
3416. 
3417. "Carrot ices."
3418. 
3419. "No! What kind, Marya Dmitrievna? What kind?" she almost screamed; "I
3420. want to know!"
3421. 
3422. Marya Dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the guests
3423. joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Marya Dmitrievna's answer but at the
3424. incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to
3425. treat Marya Dmitrievna in this fashion.
3426. 
3427. Natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
3428. pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band
3429. again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving
3430. their seats, went up to "congratulate" the countess, and reached across
3431. the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with
3432. one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the
3433. same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the guests
3434. returned to the drawing room and to the count's study.
3435. 
3436. 
3437. 
3438. 
3439. 
3440. CHAPTER XX
3441. 
3442. 
3443. The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the count's
3444. visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms, some in the
3445. sitting room, some in the library.
3446. 
3447. The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from
3448. dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything.
3449. The young people, at the countess' instigation, gathered round the
3450. clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she
3451. had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the
3452. other young ladies in begging Natasha and Nicholas, who were noted for
3453. their musical talent, to sing something. Natasha, who was treated as
3454. though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the
3455. same time felt shy.
3456. 
3457. "What shall we sing?" she said.
3458. 
3459. "'The Brook,'" suggested Nicholas.
3460. 
3461. "Well, then, let's be quick. Boris, come here," said Natasha. "But where
3462. is Sonya?"
3463. 
3464. She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to
3465. look for her.
3466. 
3467. Running into Sonya's room and not finding her there, Natasha ran to the
3468. nursery, but Sonya was not there either. Natasha concluded that she must
3469. be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was the place
3470. of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostov household.
3471. And there in fact was Sonya lying face downward on Nurse's dirty feather
3472. bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her,
3473. hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively
3474. that her bare little shoulders shook. Natasha's face, which had been so
3475. radiantly happy all that saint's day, suddenly changed: her eyes became
3476. fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of
3477. her mouth drooped.
3478. 
3479. "Sonya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!" And
3480. Natasha's large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began
3481. to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sonya was crying.
3482. Sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and hid her face
3483. still deeper in the bed. Natasha wept, sitting on the blue-striped
3484. feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort Sonya sat up and
3485. began wiping her eyes and explaining.
3486. 
3487. "Nicholas is going away in a week's time, his... papers... have come...
3488. he told me himself... but still I should not cry," and she showed
3489. a paper she held in her hand--with the verses Nicholas had written,
3490. "still, I should not cry, but you can't... no one can understand... what
3491. a soul he has!"
3492. 
3493. And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.
3494. 
3495. "It's all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and Boris
3496. also," she went on, gaining a little strength; "he is nice... there are
3497. no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin... one would
3498. have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it can't be done.
3499. And besides, if she tells Mamma" (Sonya looked upon the countess as her
3500. mother and called her so) "that I am spoiling Nicholas' career and am
3501. heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God is my witness," and she
3502. made the sign of the cross, "I love her so much, and all of you, only
3503. Vera... And what for? What have I done to her? I am so grateful to you
3504. that I would willingly sacrifice everything, only I have nothing...."
3505. 
3506. Sonya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the
3507. feather bed. Natasha began consoling her, but her face showed that she
3508. understood all the gravity of her friend's trouble.
3509. 
3510. "Sonya," she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason
3511. of her friend's sorrow, "I'm sure Vera has said something to you since
3512. dinner? Hasn't she?"
3513. 
3514. "Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and
3515. she found them on my table and said she'd show them to Mamma, and that
3516. I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me,
3517. but that he'll marry Julie. You see how he's been with her all day...
3518. Natasha, what have I done to deserve it?..."
3519. 
3520. And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natasha lifted
3521. her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting
3522. her.
3523. 
3524. "Sonya, don't believe her, darling! Don't believe her! Do you remember
3525. how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room after
3526. supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don't quite remember
3527. how, but don't you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice
3528. it all was? There's Uncle Shinshin's brother has married his first
3529. cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know. And Boris says it
3530. is quite possible. You know I have told him all about it. And he is so
3531. clever and so good!" said Natasha. "Don't you cry, Sonya, dear love,
3532. darling Sonya!" and she kissed her and laughed. "Vera's spiteful; never
3533. mind her! And all will come right and she won't say anything to Mamma.
3534. Nicholas will tell her himself, and he doesn't care at all for Julie."
3535. 
3536. Natasha kissed her on the hair.
3537. 
3538. Sonya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it
3539. seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin
3540. playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.
3541. 
3542. "Do you think so?... Really? Truly?" she said, quickly smoothing her
3543. frock and hair.
3544. 
3545. "Really, truly!" answered Natasha, pushing in a crisp lock that had
3546. strayed from under her friend's plaits.
3547. 
3548. Both laughed.
3549. 
3550. "Well, let's go and sing 'The Brook.'"
3551. 
3552. "Come along!"
3553. 
3554. "Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!" said
3555. Natasha, stopping suddenly. "I feel so happy!"
3556. 
3557. And she set off at a run along the passage.
3558. 
3559. Sonya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
3560. verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran
3561. after Natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face
3562. and light, joyous steps. At the visitors' request the young people sang
3563. the quartette, "The Brook," with which everyone was delighted. Then
3564. Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:
3565. 
3566. 
3567.    At nighttime in the moon's fair glow
3568.      How sweet, as fancies wander free,
3569.    To feel that in this world there's one
3570.      Who still is thinking but of thee!
3571. 
3572.    That while her fingers touch the harp
3573.      Wafting sweet music o'er the lea,
3574.    It is for thee thus swells her heart,
3575.      Sighing its message out to thee...
3576. 
3577.    A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,
3578.      But oh! till then I cannot live!...
3579. 
3580. 
3581. He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to
3582. get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the
3583. coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.
3584. 
3585. 
3586. Pierre was sitting in the drawing-room where Shinshin had engaged him,
3587. as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in
3588. which several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began
3589. Natasha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and
3590. blushing:
3591. 
3592. "Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers."
3593. 
3594. "I am afraid of mixing the figures," Pierre replied; "but if you will
3595. be my teacher..." And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender
3596. little girl.
3597. 
3598. While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,
3599. Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natasha was perfectly happy;
3600. she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was
3601. sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady.
3602. She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold.
3603. Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where
3604. she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and
3605. smiling over the fan.
3606. 
3607. "Dear, dear! Just look at her!" exclaimed the countess as she crossed
3608. the ballroom, pointing to Natasha.
3609. 
3610. Natasha blushed and laughed.
3611. 
3612. "Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised at?"
3613. 
3614. 
3615. In the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being
3616. pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Marya Dmitrievna had
3617. been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older
3618. visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long, and
3619. replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First came
3620. Marya Dmitrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The count,
3621. with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to
3622. Marya Dmitrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit
3623. up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended,
3624. he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery,
3625. addressing the first violin:
3626. 
3627. "Semen! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?"
3628. 
3629. This was the count's favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.
3630. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)
3631. 
3632. "Look at Papa!" shouted Natasha to the whole company, and quite
3633. forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her
3634. curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.
3635. 
3636. And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
3637. jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,
3638. Marya Dmitrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his
3639. shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by
3640. a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the
3641. onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay
3642. strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant
3643. dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly
3644. filled by the domestic serfs--the men on one side and the women on the
3645. other--who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry.
3646. 
3647. "Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!" loudly remarked the
3648. nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.
3649. 
3650. The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not
3651. want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms
3652. hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her
3653. stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed
3654. by the whole of the count's plump figure, in Marya Dmitrievna found
3655. expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.
3656. But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed
3657. the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the
3658. agility with which he capered about on his light feet, Marya Dmitrievna
3659. produced no less impression by slight exertions--the least effort
3660. to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her
3661. foot--which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual
3662. severity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could
3663. not attract a moment's attention to their own evolutions and did not
3664. even try to do so. All were watching the count and Marya Dmitrievna.
3665. Natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to "look
3666. at Papa!" though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple.
3667. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved and
3668. shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster;
3669. lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying
3670. round Marya Dmitrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until,
3671. turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas,
3672. raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling
3673. and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and
3674. laughter led by Natasha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily
3675. and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.
3676. 
3677. "That's how we used to dance in our time, ma chere," said the count.
3678. 
3679. "That was a Daniel Cooper!" exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna, tucking up her
3680. sleeves and puffing heavily.
3681. 
3682. 
3683. 
3684. 
3685. 
3686. CHAPTER XXI
3687. 
3688. 
3689. While in the Rostovs' ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced, to a
3690. tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and
3691. cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezukhov had a sixth stroke.
3692. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute confession,
3693. communion was administered to the dying man, preparations made for the
3694. sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle and thrill
3695. of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond the gates,
3696. a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in
3697. expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral. The Military
3698. Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to
3699. inquire after the count's health, came himself that evening to bid a
3700. last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine's court, Count
3701. Bezukhov.
3702. 
3703. The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up
3704. respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an
3705. hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their
3706. bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
3707. on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince
3708. Vasili, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days,
3709. escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in
3710. low tones.
3711. 
3712. When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasili sat down all alone on
3713. a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other, leaning
3714. his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After sitting
3715. so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened eyes,
3716. went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the
3717. back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.
3718. 
3719. Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
3720. whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man's
3721. room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at
3722. his door, which creaked slightly when opened.
3723. 
3724. "The limits of human life... are fixed and may not be o'erpassed,"
3725. said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was
3726. listening naively to his words.
3727. 
3728. "I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?" asked the lady,
3729. adding the priest's clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own
3730. on the subject.
3731. 
3732. "Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament," replied the priest, passing his
3733. hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald
3734. head.
3735. 
3736. "Who was that? The Military Governor himself?" was being asked at the
3737. other side of the room. "How young-looking he is!"
3738. 
3739. "Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes
3740. anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction."
3741. 
3742. "I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times."
3743. 
3744. The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
3745. from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a
3746. graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a
3747. table.
3748. 
3749. "Beautiful," said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather.
3750. "The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow one feels as
3751. if one were in the country."
3752. 
3753. "Yes, indeed," replied the princess with a sigh. "So he may have
3754. something to drink?"
3755. 
3756. Lorrain considered.
3757. 
3758. "Has he taken his medicine?"
3759. 
3760. "Yes."
3761. 
3762. The doctor glanced at his watch.
3763. 
3764. "Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar," and
3765. he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.
3766. 
3767. "Dere has neffer been a gase," a German doctor was saying to an
3768. aide-de-camp, "dat one liffs after de sird stroke."
3769. 
3770. "And what a well-preserved man he was!" remarked the aide-de-camp. "And
3771. who will inherit his wealth?" he added in a whisper.
3772. 
3773. "It von't go begging," replied the German with a smile.
3774. 
3775. Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second
3776. princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain's
3777. instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.
3778. 
3779. "Do you think he can last till morning?" asked the German, addressing
3780. Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.
3781. 
3782. Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before
3783. his nose.
3784. 
3785. "Tonight, not later," said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a
3786. decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand
3787. and state the patient's condition.
3788. 
3789. 
3790. Meanwhile Prince Vasili had opened the door into the princess' room.
3791. 
3792. In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before
3793. the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.
3794. The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots,
3795. cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was
3796. just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.
3797. 
3798. "Ah, is it you, cousin?"
3799. 
3800. She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth
3801. that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with
3802. varnish.
3803. 
3804. "Has anything happened?" she asked. "I am so terrified."
3805. 
3806. "No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business,
3807. Catiche," * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair
3808. she had just vacated. "You have made the place warm, I must say," he
3809. remarked. "Well, sit down: let's have a talk."
3810. 
3811. 
3812.      *Catherine.
3813. 
3814. 
3815. "I thought perhaps something had happened," she said with her unchanging
3816. stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the prince, she
3817. prepared to listen.
3818. 
3819. "I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can't."
3820. 
3821. "Well, my dear?" said Prince Vasili, taking her hand and bending it
3822. downwards as was his habit.
3823. 
3824. It was plain that this "well?" referred to much that they both
3825. understood without naming.
3826. 
3827. The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her
3828. legs, looked directly at Prince Vasili with no sign of emotion in her
3829. prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons
3830. with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and
3831. devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince Vasili
3832. understood it as an expression of weariness.
3833. 
3834. "And I?" he said; "do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out
3835. as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very
3836. serious talk."
3837. 
3838. Prince Vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now
3839. on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression
3840. which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes too seemed
3841. strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next
3842. glanced round in alarm.
3843. 
3844. The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
3845. hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasili's eyes evidently resolved
3846. not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.
3847. 
3848. "Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semenovna,"
3849. continued Prince Vasili, returning to his theme, apparently not
3850. without an inner struggle; "at such a moment as this one must think of
3851. everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you
3852. all, like children of my own, as you know."
3853. 
3854. The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same
3855. dull expression.
3856. 
3857. "And then of course my family has also to be considered," Prince Vasili
3858. went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her.
3859. "You know, Catiche, that we--you three sisters, Mamontov, and my
3860. wife--are the count's only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is
3861. for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me; but,
3862. my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything. Do
3863. you know I have sent for Pierre? The count," pointing to his portrait,
3864. "definitely demanded that he should be called."
3865. 
3866. Prince Vasili looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make
3867. out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was
3868. simply looking at him.
3869. 
3870. "There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin," she
3871. replied, "and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his
3872. noble soul peacefully to leave this..."
3873. 
3874. "Yes, yes, of course," interrupted Prince Vasili impatiently, rubbing
3875. his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that
3876. he had pushed away. "But... in short, the fact is... you know yourself
3877. that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his
3878. property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre."
3879. 
3880. "He has made wills enough!" quietly remarked the princess. "But he
3881. cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate."
3882. 
3883. "But, my dear," said Prince Vasili suddenly, clutching the little table
3884. and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: "what if a letter
3885. has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre's
3886. legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the count's
3887. services, his request would be granted?..."
3888. 
3889. The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the
3890. subject under discussion than those they are talking with.
3891. 
3892. "I can tell you more," continued Prince Vasili, seizing her hand, "that
3893. letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it.
3894. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon
3895. as all is over," and Prince Vasili sighed to intimate what he meant by
3896. the words all is over, "and the count's papers are opened, the will and
3897. letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition will certainly
3898. be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son."
3899. 
3900. "And our share?" asked the princess smiling ironically, as if anything
3901. might happen, only not that.
3902. 
3903. "But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the
3904. legal heir to everything and you won't get anything. You must know, my
3905. dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have
3906. been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you
3907. ought to know where they are, and must find them, because..."
3908. 
3909. "What next?" the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not
3910. changing the expression of her eyes. "I am a woman, and you think we are
3911. all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit... un
3912. batard!" * she added, as if supposing that this translation of the
3913. word would effectively prove to Prince Vasili the invalidity of his
3914. contention.
3915. 
3916. 
3917.      * A bastard.
3918. 
3919. 
3920. "Well, really, Catiche! Can't you understand! You are so intelligent,
3921. how is it you don't see that if the count has written a letter to the
3922. Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that
3923. Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezukhov, and will then
3924. inherit everything under the will? And if the will and letter are not
3925. destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been
3926. dutiful et tout ce qui s'ensuit! * That's certain."
3927. 
3928. 
3929.      * And all that follows therefrom.
3930. 
3931. 
3932. "I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and you,
3933. mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool," said the princess with
3934. the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something
3935. witty and stinging.
3936. 
3937. "My dear Princess Catherine Semenovna," began Prince Vasili impatiently,
3938. "I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about your interests
3939. as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I tell you for the
3940. tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre's
3941. favor are among the count's papers, then, my dear girl, you and your
3942. sisters are not heiresses! If you don't believe me, then believe
3943. an expert. I have just been talking to Dmitri Onufrich" (the family
3944. solicitor) "and he says the same."
3945. 
3946. At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess' ideas; her
3947. thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice
3948. when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself
3949. evidently did not expect.
3950. 
3951. "That would be a fine thing!" said she. "I never wanted anything and I
3952. don't now."
3953. 
3954. She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.
3955. 
3956. "And this is gratitude--this is recognition for those who have
3957. sacrificed everything for his sake!" she cried. "It's splendid! Fine! I
3958. don't want anything, Prince."
3959. 
3960. "Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters..." replied
3961. Prince Vasili.
3962. 
3963. But the princess did not listen to him.
3964. 
3965. "Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect
3966. nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude--the
3967. blackest ingratitude--in this house..."
3968. 
3969. "Do you or do you not know where that will is?" insisted Prince Vasili,
3970. his cheeks twitching more than ever.
3971. 
3972. "Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and
3973. sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has
3974. been intriguing!"
3975. 
3976. The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She
3977. had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race.
3978. She gave her companion an angry glance.
3979. 
3980. "There is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was
3981. all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards
3982. forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his
3983. last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let
3984. him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who..."
3985. 
3986. "Who sacrificed everything for him," chimed in the princess, who would
3987. again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, "though he
3988. never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin," she added with a sigh, "I
3989. shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward, that
3990. in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one has
3991. to be cunning and cruel."
3992. 
3993. "Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart."
3994. 
3995. "No, I have a wicked heart."
3996. 
3997. "I know your heart," repeated the prince. "I value your friendship and
3998. wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don't upset yourself, and let
3999. us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it but an
4000. hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where it is.
4001. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the count. He has,
4002. no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it. You understand that
4003. my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes; that is my
4004. only reason for being here. I came simply to help him and you."
4005. 
4006. "Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing--I know!" cried the
4007. princess.
4008. 
4009. "That's not the point, my dear."
4010. 
4011. "It's that protege of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskaya, that Anna
4012. Mikhaylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the infamous, vile
4013. woman!"
4014. 
4015. "Do not let us lose any time..."
4016. 
4017. "Ah, don't talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and
4018. told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about
4019. Sophie--I can't repeat them--that it made the count quite ill and he
4020. would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this
4021. vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid."
4022. 
4023. "We've got to it at last--why did you not tell me about it sooner?"
4024. 
4025. "It's in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow," said the
4026. princess, ignoring his question. "Now I know! Yes; if I have a sin,
4027. a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!" almost shrieked the
4028. princess, now quite changed. "And what does she come worming herself in
4029. here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time will come!"
4030. 
4031. 
4032. 
4033. 
4034. 
4035. CHAPTER XXII
4036. 
4037. 
4038. While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the
4039. princess' room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and
4040. Anna Mikhaylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was driving
4041. into the court of Count Bezukhov's house. As the wheels rolled softly
4042. over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikhaylovna, having turned with
4043. words of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in
4044. his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna
4045. Mikhaylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the
4046. interview with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they
4047. had not come to the front entrance but to the back door. While he
4048. was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like
4049. tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of
4050. the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the
4051. same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides. But neither
4052. Anna Mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help
4053. seeing these people, took any notice of them. "It seems to be all
4054. right," Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikhaylovna. She hurriedly
4055. ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre,
4056. who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it was
4057. necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go
4058. by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikhaylovna's air of assurance
4059. and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary.
4060. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who,
4061. carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. These
4062. men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna pass
4063. and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.
4064. 
4065. "Is this the way to the princesses' apartments?" asked Anna Mikhaylovna
4066. of one of them.
4067. 
4068. "Yes," replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were now
4069. permissible; "the door to the left, ma'am."
4070. 
4071. "Perhaps the count did not ask for me," said Pierre when he reached the
4072. landing. "I'd better go to my own room."
4073. 
4074. Anna Mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come up.
4075. 
4076. "Ah, my friend!" she said, touching his arm as she had done her son's
4077. when speaking to him that afternoon, "believe me I suffer no less than
4078. you do, but be a man!"
4079. 
4080. "But really, hadn't I better go away?" he asked, looking kindly at her
4081. over his spectacles.
4082. 
4083. "Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you.
4084. Think that he is your father... perhaps in the agony of death." She
4085. sighed. "I have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to
4086. me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests."
4087. 
4088. Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had
4089. to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikhaylovna who was
4090. already opening a door.
4091. 
4092. This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the
4093. princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been
4094. in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of
4095. these rooms. Anna Mikhaylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past
4096. with a decanter on a tray as "my dear" and "my sweet," asked about the
4097. princess' health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The first
4098. door on the left led into the princesses' apartments. The maid with the
4099. decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house
4100. was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna Mikhaylovna in
4101. passing instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince Vasili and the
4102. eldest princess were sitting close together talking. Seeing them pass,
4103. Prince Vasili drew back with obvious impatience, while the princess
4104. jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all
4105. her might.
4106. 
4107. This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted
4108. on Prince Vasili's face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre
4109. stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna
4110. Mikhaylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as
4111. if to say that this was no more than she had expected.
4112. 
4113. "Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests," said she in
4114. reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.
4115. 
4116. Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what
4117. "watching over his interests" meant, but he decided that all these
4118. things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit
4119. room adjoining the count's reception room. It was one of those sumptuous
4120. but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but
4121. even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been
4122. spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer and by
4123. a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They went into
4124. the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening
4125. into the conservatory, with its large bust and full length portrait of
4126. Catherine the Great. The same people were still sitting here in almost
4127. the same positions as before, whispering to one another. All became
4128. silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna Mikhaylovna as she
4129. entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head,
4130. meekly followed her.
4131. 
4132. Anna Mikhaylovna's face expressed a consciousness that the decisive
4133. moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now,
4134. keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than
4135. that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the
4136. dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid
4137. glance at all those in the room and noticing the count's confessor
4138. there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet
4139. seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing
4140. first of one and then of another priest.
4141. 
4142. "God be thanked that you are in time," said she to one of the priests;
4143. "all we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young man is the
4144. count's son," she added more softly. "What a terrible moment!"
4145. 
4146. Having said this she went up to the doctor.
4147. 
4148. "Dear doctor," said she, "this young man is the count's son. Is there
4149. any hope?"
4150. 
4151. The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
4152. shoulders. Anna Mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised her
4153. shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away
4154. from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and
4155. tenderly sad voice, she said:
4156. 
4157. "Trust in His mercy!" and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit
4158. and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was
4159. watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.
4160. 
4161. Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved
4162. toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikhaylovna had
4163. disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him
4164. with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they
4165. whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind
4166. of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before
4167. received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to
4168. the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up
4169. and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully
4170. silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre
4171. wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to
4172. pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not
4173. even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and
4174. that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful
4175. rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound
4176. to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the
4177. aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady's chair, placing his huge hands
4178. symmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an Egyptian statue,
4179. and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in
4180. order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his
4181. own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of
4182. those who were guiding him.
4183. 
4184. Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasili with head erect
4185. majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three
4186. stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning;
4187. his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed
4188. Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do),
4189. and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly
4190. fixed on.
4191. 
4192. "Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is well!"
4193. and he turned to go.
4194. 
4195. But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: "How is..." and hesitated, not
4196. knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man "the count,"
4197. yet ashamed to call him "father."
4198. 
4199. "He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my friend..."
4200. 
4201. Pierre's mind was in such a confused state that the word "stroke"
4202. suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasili
4203. in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
4204. illness. Prince Vasili said something to Lorrain in passing and went
4205. through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his
4206. whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and
4207. the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door.
4208. Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and at
4209. last Anna Mikhaylovna, still with the same expression, pale but resolute
4210. in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm
4211. said:
4212. 
4213. "The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be administered.
4214. Come."
4215. 
4216. Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed
4217. that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all
4218. followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to
4219. enter that room.
4220. 
4221. 
4222. 
4223. 
4224. 
4225. CHAPTER XXIII
4226. 
4227. 
4228. Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its
4229. walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the
4230. columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and
4231. on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated
4232. with red light like a Russian church during evening service. Under
4233. the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair
4234. on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre
4235. saw--covered to the waist by a bright green quilt--the familiar,
4236. majestic figure of his father, Count Bezukhov, with that gray mane of
4237. hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep
4238. characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay
4239. just under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the
4240. right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust
4241. between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from
4242. behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the priests,
4243. their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments,
4244. with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the
4245. service. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding
4246. handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest
4247. sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on
4248. the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer
4249. for herself should she glance round. Anna Mikhaylovna, with a meek,
4250. sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door
4251. near the strange lady. Prince Vasili in front of the door, near the
4252. invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on
4253. the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose,
4254. and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward
4255. each time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety
4256. and resignation to the will of God. "If you do not understand these
4257. sentiments," he seemed to be saying, "so much the worse for you!"
4258. 
4259. Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants;
4260. the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing
4261. themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting
4262. of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of
4263. feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mikhaylovna, with an
4264. air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was
4265. about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him
4266. a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him, began
4267. crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.
4268. 
4269. Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole,
4270. watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained
4271. with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she
4272. again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him
4273. without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of
4274. temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst
4275. of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered
4276. to one another, and the old servant who was holding the count's hand got
4277. up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikhaylovna stepped forward
4278. and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her
4279. back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning against one of the
4280. columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite
4281. of all differences of faith, understood the full importance of the rite
4282. now being performed and even approved of it. He now approached the
4283. sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his
4284. delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was
4285. free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The
4286. sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir around him, then
4287. the people resumed their places and the service continued. During this
4288. interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasili left the chair on which he
4289. had been leaning, and--with an air which intimated that he knew what he
4290. was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse
4291. for them--did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the
4292. eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood
4293. the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the bed both
4294. Prince Vasili and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned
4295. to their places one after the other before the service was concluded.
4296. Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of
4297. what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw
4298. happening around him that evening was in some way essential.
4299. 
4300. The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was
4301. heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the
4302. sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around
4303. him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which
4304. Anna Mikhaylovna's was the most distinct.
4305. 
4306. Pierre heard her say:
4307. 
4308. "Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be impossible..."
4309. 
4310. The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants
4311. that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray
4312. mane--which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of
4313. for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the cautious
4314. movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had
4315. lifted the dying man and were moving him.
4316. 
4317. "Catch hold of my arm or you'll drop him!" he heard one of the servants
4318. say in a frightened whisper. "Catch hold from underneath. Here!"
4319. exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and
4320. the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they
4321. were carrying were too much for them.
4322. 
4323. As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikhaylovna, passed the young man
4324. he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying
4325. man's high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by
4326. those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,
4327. leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones,
4328. its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was
4329. not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre
4330. remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to
4331. Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven
4332. movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon
4333. nothing.
4334. 
4335. After a few minutes' bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had
4336. carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikhaylovna touched Pierre's hand
4337. and said, "Come." Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick
4338. man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just
4339. completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His hands
4340. were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downward.
4341. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a
4342. look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man.
4343. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they
4344. must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing
4345. what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikhaylovna made
4346. a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man's hand and moving
4347. her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his neck
4348. so as not to touch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his
4349. lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a
4350. single muscle of the count's face stirred. Once more Pierre looked
4351. questioningly at Anna Mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next. Anna
4352. Mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed.
4353. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right.
4354. Anna Mikhaylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell into the naively
4355. symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that his
4356. stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look
4357. as small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed at the
4358. spot where Pierre's face had been before he sat down. Anna Mikhaylovna
4359. indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance
4360. of these last moments of meeting between the father and son. This lasted
4361. about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad
4362. muscles and lines of the count's face began to twitch. The twitching
4363. increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre
4364. realize how near death his father was), and from that distorted mouth
4365. issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikhaylovna looked attentively
4366. at the sick man's eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed
4367. first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasili in an
4368. inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the
4369. sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who
4370. stood constantly at the head of the bed.
4371. 
4372. "Wants to turn on the other side," whispered the servant, and got up to
4373. turn the count's heavy body toward the wall.
4374. 
4375. Pierre rose to help him.
4376. 
4377. While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back
4378. helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he
4379. noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm,
4380. or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any
4381. rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre's terror-stricken face,
4382. and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared,
4383. quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own
4384. helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering
4385. in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. The
4386. sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall. He sighed.
4387. 
4388. "He is dozing," said Anna Mikhaylovna, observing that one of the
4389. princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. "Let us go."
4390. 
4391. Pierre went out.
4392. 
4393. 
4394. 
4395. 
4396. 
4397. CHAPTER XXIV
4398. 
4399. 
4400. There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasili and the
4401. eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the
4402. Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion
4403. they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide
4404. something as she whispered:
4405. 
4406. "I can't bear the sight of that woman."
4407. 
4408. "Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room," said Prince
4409. Vasili to Anna Mikhaylovna. "Go and take something, my poor Anna
4410. Mikhaylovna, or you will not hold out."
4411. 
4412. To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze
4413. below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikhaylovna into the small
4414. drawing room.
4415. 
4416. "There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this
4417. delicious Russian tea," Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained
4418. animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless
4419. cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small
4420. circular room. Around the table all who were at Count Bezukhov's house
4421. that night had gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre well remembered
4422. this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables.
4423. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance,
4424. had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed
4425. through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare
4426. shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which
4427. repeated their reflections several times. Now this same room was dimly
4428. lighted by two candles. On one small table tea things and supper dishes
4429. stood in disorder, and in the middle of the night a motley throng
4430. of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and
4431. betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what
4432. was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did
4433. not eat anything though he would very much have liked to. He looked
4434. inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe
4435. to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasili and the eldest
4436. princess. Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a
4437. short interval followed her. Anna Mikhaylovna was standing beside the
4438. princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.
4439. 
4440. "Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not
4441. necessary," said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the same
4442. state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.
4443. 
4444. "But, my dear princess," answered Anna Mikhaylovna blandly but
4445. impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
4446. from passing, "won't this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he
4447. needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already
4448. prepared..."
4449. 
4450. Prince Vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with
4451. one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so flabby
4452. that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but he wore
4453. the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying.
4454. 
4455. "Come, my dear Anna Mikhaylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You know
4456. how fond the count is of her."
4457. 
4458. "I don't even know what is in this paper," said the younger of the two
4459. ladies, addressing Prince Vasili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she
4460. held in her hand. "All I know is that his real will is in his writing
4461. table, and this is a paper he has forgotten...."
4462. 
4463. She tried to pass Anna Mikhaylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar
4464. her path.
4465. 
4466. "I know, my dear, kind princess," said Anna Mikhaylovna, seizing the
4467. portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.
4468. "Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous en
4469. conjure..."
4470. 
4471. The princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the
4472. portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if
4473. the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna
4474. Mikhaylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none
4475. of its honeyed firmness and softness.
4476. 
4477. "Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a
4478. family consultation; is it not so, Prince?"
4479. 
4480. "Why don't you speak, cousin?" suddenly shrieked the princess so loud
4481. that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. "Why do you
4482. remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere, making
4483. a scene on the very threshold of a dying man's room? Intriguer!" she
4484. hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio.
4485. 
4486. But Anna Mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the
4487. portfolio, and changed her grip.
4488. 
4489. Prince Vasili rose. "Oh!" said he with reproach and surprise, "this is
4490. absurd! Come, let go I tell you."
4491. 
4492. The princess let go.
4493. 
4494. "And you too!"
4495. 
4496. But Anna Mikhaylovna did not obey him.
4497. 
4498. "Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go
4499. and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?"
4500. 
4501. "But, Prince," said Anna Mikhaylovna, "after such a solemn sacrament,
4502. allow him a moment's peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion," said
4503. she, turning to the young man who, having come quite close, was gazing
4504. with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all
4505. dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasili.
4506. 
4507. "Remember that you will answer for the consequences," said Prince Vasili
4508. severely. "You don't know what you are doing."
4509. 
4510. "Vile woman!" shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna
4511. Mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.
4512. 
4513. Prince Vasili bent his head and spread out his hands.
4514. 
4515. At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long
4516. and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged
4517. against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out
4518. wringing her hands.
4519. 
4520. "What are you doing!" she cried vehemently. "He is dying and you leave
4521. me alone with him!"
4522. 
4523. Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikhaylovna, stooping, quickly
4524. caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest
4525. princess and Prince Vasili, recovering themselves, followed her. A few
4526. minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again
4527. biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an
4528. irrepressible hatred.
4529. 
4530. "Yes, now you may be glad!" said she; "this is what you have been
4531. waiting for." And bursting into tears she hid her face in her
4532. handkerchief and rushed from the room.
4533. 
4534. Prince Vasili came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was
4535. sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre
4536. noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an
4537. ague.
4538. 
4539. "Ah, my friend!" said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was
4540. in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it
4541. before. "How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am
4542. near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is
4543. awful..." and he burst into tears.
4544. 
4545. Anna Mikhaylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet
4546. steps.
4547. 
4548. "Pierre!" she said.
4549. 
4550. Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his
4551. forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:
4552. 
4553. "He is no more...."
4554. 
4555. Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.
4556. 
4557. "Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as
4558. tears."
4559. 
4560. She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could
4561. see his face. Anna Mikhaylovna left him, and when she returned he was
4562. fast asleep with his head on his arm.
4563. 
4564. In the morning Anna Mikhaylovna said to Pierre:
4565. 
4566. "Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you. But
4567. God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of
4568. an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you well
4569. enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes
4570. duties on you, and you must be a man."
4571. 
4572. Pierre was silent.
4573. 
4574. "Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been
4575. there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised
4576. me only the day before yesterday not to forget Boris. But he had no
4577. time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's wish?"
4578. 
4579. Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
4580. silence at Princess Anna Mikhaylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna
4581. Mikhaylovna returned to the Rostovs' and went to bed. On waking in the
4582. morning she told the Rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of
4583. Count Bezukhov's death. She said the count had died as she would herself
4584. wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As to the
4585. last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she could
4586. not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved better
4587. during those awful moments--the father who so remembered everything
4588. and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or
4589. Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief,
4590. though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father.
4591. "It is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such
4592. men as the old count and his worthy son," said she. Of the behavior of
4593. the eldest princess and Prince Vasili she spoke disapprovingly, but in
4594. whispers and as a great secret.
4595. 
4596. 
4597. 
4598. 
4599. 
4600. CHAPTER XXV
4601. 
4602. 
4603. At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andreevich Bolkonski's estate, the
4604. arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but
4605. this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the
4606. old prince's household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andreevich
4607. (nicknamed in society, "the King of Prussia") ever since the Emperor
4608. Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
4609. with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle
4610. Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the
4611. capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that
4612. anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to
4613. Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to
4614. say that there are only two sources of human vice--idleness and
4615. superstition, and only two virtues--activity and intelligence. He
4616. himself undertook his daughter's education, and to develop these two
4617. cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry
4618. till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was
4619. occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving
4620. problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working
4621. in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on
4622. at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity,
4623. regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of
4624. exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions,
4625. and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about
4626. him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably
4627. exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear
4628. and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was
4629. in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high
4630. official appointed to the province in which the prince's estate lay
4631. considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber
4632. just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince
4633. appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this
4634. antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when
4635. the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather
4636. small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray
4637. eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd,
4638. youthfully glittering eyes.
4639. 
4640. On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess
4641. Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the
4642. morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a
4643. silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning
4644. prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.
4645. 
4646. An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
4647. quietly and said in a whisper: "Please walk in."
4648. 
4649. Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly
4650. opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the
4651. entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round
4652. continued his work.
4653. 
4654. The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use.
4655. The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted
4656. bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while
4657. standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with
4658. tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around--all indicated
4659. continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot
4660. shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure
4661. of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the
4662. tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more turns
4663. of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel,
4664. dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching
4665. the table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing,
4666. so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding
4667. her tenderly and attentively, said severely:
4668. 
4669. "Quite well? All right then, sit down." He took the exercise book
4670. containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
4671. with his foot.
4672. 
4673. "For tomorrow!" said he, quickly finding the page and making a scratch
4674. from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.
4675. 
4676. The princess bent over the exercise book on the table.
4677. 
4678. "Wait a bit, here's a letter for you," said the old man suddenly, taking
4679. a letter addressed in a woman's hand from a bag hanging above the table,
4680. onto which he threw it.
4681. 
4682. At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
4683. princess' face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.
4684. 
4685. "From Heloise?" asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still
4686. sound, yellowish teeth.
4687. 
4688. "Yes, it's from Julie," replied the princess with a timid glance and a
4689. timid smile.
4690. 
4691. "I'll let two more letters pass, but the third I'll read," said the
4692. prince sternly; "I'm afraid you write much nonsense. I'll read the
4693. third!"
4694. 
4695. "Read this if you like, Father," said the princess, blushing still more
4696. and holding out the letter.
4697. 
4698. "The third, I said the third!" cried the prince abruptly, pushing the
4699. letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the
4700. exercise book containing geometrical figures.
4701. 
4702. "Well, madam," he began, stooping over the book close to his daughter
4703. and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that
4704. she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age
4705. and tobacco, which she had known so long. "Now, madam, these triangles
4706. are equal; please note that the angle ABC..."
4707. 
4708. The princess looked in a scared way at her father's eyes glittering
4709. close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was
4710. plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her
4711. fear would prevent her understanding any of her father's further
4712. explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the teacher's
4713. fault or the pupil's, this same thing happened every day: the princess'
4714. eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear anything, but was
4715. only conscious of her stern father's withered face close to her, of his
4716. breath and the smell of him, and could think only of how to get away
4717. quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace. The old man
4718. was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily
4719. backward and forward, made efforts to control himself and not become
4720. vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded, and sometimes
4721. flung the exercise book away.
4722. 
4723. The princess gave a wrong answer.
4724. 
4725. "Well now, isn't she a fool!" shouted the prince, pushing the book aside
4726. and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and down,
4727. lightly touched his daughter's hair and sat down again.
4728. 
4729. He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.
4730. 
4731. "This won't do, Princess; it won't do," said he, when Princess Mary,
4732. having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day's lesson,
4733. was about to leave: "Mathematics are most important, madam! I don't want
4734. to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and you'll like it,"
4735. and he patted her cheek. "It will drive all the nonsense out of your
4736. head."
4737. 
4738. She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut
4739. book from the high desk.
4740. 
4741. "Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Heloise has sent
4742. you. Religious! I don't interfere with anyone's belief... I have looked
4743. at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go."
4744. 
4745. He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.
4746. 
4747. Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that
4748. rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She
4749. sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and
4750. which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as
4751. her father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke
4752. the seal of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from
4753. childhood; that same Julie Karagina who had been at the Rostovs'
4754. name-day party.
4755. 
4756. Julie wrote in French:
4757. 
4758. 
4759. Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is
4760. separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness
4761. are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us
4762. our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against
4763. fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot
4764. overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since
4765. we parted. Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big
4766. study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as
4767. three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle,
4768. calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me
4769. as I write?
4770. 
4771. 
4772. Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror
4773. which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and
4774. thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness
4775. at her reflection in the glass. "She flatters me," thought the princess,
4776. turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter her
4777. friend, the princess' eyes--large, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at
4778. times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)--were so beautiful
4779. that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an
4780. attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the princess never saw
4781. the beautiful expression of her own eyes--the look they had when she
4782. was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her face assumed a forced
4783. unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass. She went on
4784. reading:
4785. 
4786. 
4787. All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already
4788. abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march
4789. to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought
4790. intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant
4791. that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may
4792. be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His
4793. goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this
4794. war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean
4795. young Nicholas Rostov, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain
4796. inactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to
4797. you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for
4798. the army was a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you
4799. last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which
4800. one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly,
4801. he is so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that
4802. my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the
4803. sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much.
4804. Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then.
4805. That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know
4806. these poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are
4807. generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too
4808. young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship,
4809. this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of
4810. this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of
4811. old Count Bezukhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses
4812. have received very little, Prince Vasili nothing, and it is Monsieur
4813. Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
4814. recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezukhov and possessor
4815. of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince Vasili played
4816. a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg
4817. quite crestfallen.
4818. 
4819. I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and
4820. inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used
4821. to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezukhov and the
4822. owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to
4823. watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by
4824. marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward
4825. him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort
4826. of fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves
4827. by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don't even know), the
4828. matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess
4829. Bezukhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post. A
4830. propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal auntie
4831. Anna Mikhaylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of
4832. marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vasili's
4833. son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich
4834. and distinguee, and it is on you that his relations' choice has fallen.
4835. I don't know what you will think of it, but I consider it my duty to
4836. let you know of it. He is said to be very handsome and a terrible
4837. scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find out about him.
4838. 
4839. But enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper,
4840. and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apraksins'. Read the
4841. mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though
4842. there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it
4843. is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give
4844. my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle
4845. Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you.
4846. 
4847. JULIE
4848. 
4849. P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.
4850. 
4851. 
4852. The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous
4853. eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly
4854. rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of
4855. paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote,
4856. also in French:
4857. 
4858. 
4859. Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great
4860. delight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which
4861. you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect
4862. on you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I
4863. dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if
4864. we had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you
4865. suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young
4866. man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such
4867. feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of
4868. them, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian
4869. love, love of one's neighbor, love of one's enemy, is worthier, sweeter,
4870. and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can
4871. inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.
4872. 
4873. The news of Count Bezukhov's death reached us before your letter and
4874. my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last
4875. representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own
4876. turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
4877. possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!
4878. 
4879. I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always
4880. seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value
4881. most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince
4882. Vasili, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine
4883. Saviour's words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of
4884. a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are terribly
4885. true. I pity Prince Vasili but am still more sorry for Pierre. So young,
4886. and burdened with such riches--to what temptations he will be exposed!
4887. If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be poorer
4888. than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume
4889. you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since you
4890. tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak
4891. human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend
4892. time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit.
4893. I never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing
4894. their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their
4895. doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for exaggeration
4896. quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read the Epistles
4897. and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain;
4898. for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and
4899. holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms
4900. an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us rather confine
4901. ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has
4902. left for our guidance here below. Let us try to conform to them and
4903. follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble
4904. human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all
4905. knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom
4906. what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He
4907. vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.
4908. 
4909. My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that
4910. he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasili. In
4911. regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet
4912. friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must
4913. conform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay
4914. the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as
4915. faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings
4916. toward him whom He may give me for husband.
4917. 
4918. I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival
4919. at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one,
4920. however, for he will leave, us again to take part in this unhappy war
4921. into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you
4922. are--at the heart of affairs and of the world--is the talk all of
4923. war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature--which townsfolk
4924. consider characteristic of the country--rumors of war are heard
4925. and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and
4926. countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day
4927. before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a
4928. heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our
4929. people and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of
4930. the mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should
4931. have heard the sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the
4932. laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of
4933. injuries--and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing
4934. one another.
4935. 
4936. Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy
4937. Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!
4938. 
4939. MARY
4940. 
4941. 
4942. "Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched
4943. mine. I have written to my poor mother," said the smiling Mademoiselle
4944. Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r's.
4945. She brought into Princess Mary's strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a
4946. quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self-satisfied.
4947. 
4948. "Princess, I must warn you," she added, lowering her voice and evidently
4949. listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggerated
4950. grasseyement, "the prince has been scolding Michael Ivanovich. He is in
4951. a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared."
4952. 
4953. "Ah, dear friend," replied Princess Mary, "I have asked you never to
4954. warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge him
4955. and would not have others do so."
4956. 
4957. The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes
4958. late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting
4959. room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o'clock, as the
4960. day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the
4961. clavichord.
4962. 
4963. 
4964. 
4965. 
4966. 
4967. CHAPTER XXVI
4968. 
4969. 
4970. The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of
4971. the prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house
4972. through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages--twenty
4973. times repeated--of a sonata by Dussek.
4974. 
4975. Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
4976. porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to
4977. alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old Tikhon, wearing
4978. a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in
4979. a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door.
4980. Tikhon knew that neither the son's arrival nor any other unusual event
4981. must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince Andrew
4982. apparently knew this as well as Tikhon; he looked at his watch as if to
4983. ascertain whether his father's habits had changed since he was at home
4984. last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he turned to his
4985. wife.
4986. 
4987. "He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary's room," he
4988. said.
4989. 
4990. The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes
4991. and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as
4992. merrily and prettily as ever.
4993. 
4994. "Why, this is a palace!" she said to her husband, looking around with
4995. the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball. "Let's
4996. come, quick, quick!" And with a glance round, she smiled at Tikhon, at
4997. her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.
4998. 
4999. "Is that Mary practicing? Let's go quietly and take her by surprise."
5000. 
5001. Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.
5002. 
5003. "You've grown older, Tikhon," he said in passing to the old man, who
5004. kissed his hand.
5005. 
5006. Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
5007. came, the pretty, fair haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,
5008. rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.
5009. 
5010. "Ah! what joy for the princess!" exclaimed she: "At last! I must let her
5011. know."
5012. 
5013. "No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne," said the little
5014. princess, kissing her. "I know you already through my sister-in-law's
5015. friendship for you. She was not expecting us?"
5016. 
5017. They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound
5018. of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and
5019. made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.
5020. 
5021. The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the
5022. middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary's heavy tread and the sound
5023. of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only
5024. met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each other's
5025. arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to
5026. touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her
5027. heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to
5028. laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers
5029. of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go of one
5030. another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each other's
5031. hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each
5032. other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew's surprise both began to
5033. cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry. Prince
5034. Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite
5035. natural that they should cry, and apparently it never entered their
5036. heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.
5037. 
5038. "Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!" they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed.
5039. "I dreamed last night..."--"You were not expecting us?..." "Ah! Mary,
5040. you have got thinner?..." "And you have grown stouter!..."
5041. 
5042. "I knew the princess at once," put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.
5043. 
5044. "And I had no idea!..." exclaimed Princess Mary. "Ah, Andrew, I did not
5045. see you."
5046. 
5047. Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and
5048. he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had
5049. turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm,
5050. gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,
5051. rested on Prince Andrew's face.
5052. 
5053. The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip
5054. continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary
5055. and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
5056. glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had
5057. had on the Spasski Hill which might have been serious for her in her
5058. condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left
5059. all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have
5060. to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty
5061. Odyntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary,
5062. a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was
5063. still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full
5064. of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of
5065. thought independent of her sister-in-law's words. In the midst of a
5066. description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:
5067. 
5068. "So you are really going to the war, Andrew?" she said sighing.
5069. 
5070. Lise sighed too.
5071. 
5072. "Yes, and even tomorrow," replied her brother.
5073. 
5074. "He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had
5075. promotion..."
5076. 
5077. Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of
5078. thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.
5079. 
5080. "Is it certain?" she said.
5081. 
5082. The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: "Yes,
5083. quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful..."
5084. 
5085. Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law's and
5086. unexpectedly again began to cry.
5087. 
5088. "She needs rest," said Prince Andrew with a frown. "Don't you, Lise?
5089. Take her to your room and I'll go to Father. How is he? Just the same?"
5090. 
5091. "Yes, just the same. Though I don't know what your opinion will be,"
5092. answered the princess joyfully.
5093. 
5094. "And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the
5095. lathe?" asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
5096. showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was
5097. aware of his weaknesses.
5098. 
5099. "The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and my
5100. geometry lessons," said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons in
5101. geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.
5102. 
5103. When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old
5104. prince to get up, Tikhon came to call the young prince to his father.
5105. The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his
5106. son's arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while
5107. he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned
5108. style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew
5109. entered his father's dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and
5110. manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which
5111. he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered
5112. chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tikhon.
5113. 
5114. "Ah! here's the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?" said the old
5115. man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tikhon was
5116. holding fast to plait, would allow.
5117. 
5118. "You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this
5119. he'll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?" And he held out
5120. his cheek.
5121. 
5122. The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He used
5123. to say that a nap "after dinner was silver--before dinner, golden.")
5124. He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, bushy
5125. eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the
5126. spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father's favorite
5127. topic--making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly
5128. of Bonaparte.
5129. 
5130. "Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant,"
5131. said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his father's face with
5132. an eager and respectful look. "How is your health?"
5133. 
5134. "Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from
5135. morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well."
5136. 
5137. "Thank God," said his son smiling.
5138. 
5139. "God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on," he continued, returning to
5140. his hobby; "tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte
5141. by this new science you call 'strategy.'"
5142. 
5143. Prince Andrew smiled.
5144. 
5145. "Give me time to collect my wits, Father," said he, with a smile that
5146. showed that his father's foibles did not prevent his son from loving and
5147. honoring him. "Why, I have not yet had time to settle down!"
5148. 
5149. "Nonsense, nonsense!" cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to see
5150. whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. "The house
5151. for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and show her
5152. over, and they'll talk nineteen to the dozen. That's their woman's
5153. way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About Mikhelson's army
5154. I understand--Tolstoy's too... a simultaneous expedition.... But what's
5155. the southern army to do? Prussia is neutral... I know that. What about
5156. Austria?" said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room
5157. followed by Tikhon, who ran after him, handing him different articles of
5158. clothing. "What of Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?"
5159. 
5160. Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began--at first
5161. reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit
5162. changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on--to explain
5163. the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army,
5164. ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out
5165. of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was
5166. to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty
5167. thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in
5168. Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English
5169. were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand
5170. men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did
5171. not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were
5172. not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three
5173. times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: "The
5174. white one, the white one!"
5175. 
5176. This meant that Tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.
5177. Another time he interrupted, saying:
5178. 
5179. "And will she soon be confined?" and shaking his head reproachfully
5180. said: "That's bad! Go on, go on."
5181. 
5182. The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his
5183. description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:
5184. "Malbrook s'en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra." *
5185. 
5186. 
5187.      * "Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he'll
5188.      return."
5189. 
5190. 
5191. His son only smiled.
5192. 
5193. "I don't say it's a plan I approve of," said the son; "I am only telling
5194. you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than
5195. this one."
5196. 
5197. "Well, you've told me nothing new," and the old man repeated,
5198. meditatively and rapidly:
5199. 
5200. "Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room."
5201. 
5202. 
5203. 
5204. 
5205. 
5206. CHAPTER XXVII
5207. 
5208. 
5209. At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the
5210. dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle
5211. Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who
5212. by a strange caprice of his employer's was admitted to table though the
5213. position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly
5214. not have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept
5215. very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important
5216. government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael
5217. Ivanovich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked
5218. handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had
5219. more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivanovich was "not
5220. a whit worse than you or I." At dinner the prince usually spoke to the
5221. taciturn Michael Ivanovich more often than to anyone else.
5222. 
5223. In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was
5224. exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen--one
5225. behind each chair--stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head
5226. butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making
5227. signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door
5228. by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large
5229. gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes
5230. Bolkonski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted
5231. portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate)
5232. of a ruling prince, in a crown--an alleged descendant of Rurik and
5233. ancestor of the Bolkonskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that
5234. genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at
5235. a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.
5236. 
5237. "How thoroughly like him that is!" he said to Princess Mary, who had
5238. come up to him.
5239. 
5240. Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand
5241. what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with
5242. reverence and was beyond question.
5243. 
5244. "Everyone has his Achilles' heel," continued Prince Andrew. "Fancy, with
5245. his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!"
5246. 
5247. Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother's
5248. criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard
5249. coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was
5250. his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners
5251. with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock
5252. struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing
5253. room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under
5254. their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on
5255. the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the
5256. sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around
5257. him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of
5258. her neck.
5259. 
5260. "I'm glad, glad, to see you," he said, looking attentively into her
5261. eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. "Sit down, sit
5262. down! Sit down, Michael Ianovich!"
5263. 
5264. He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved
5265. the chair for her.
5266. 
5267. "Ho, ho!" said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.
5268. "You've been in a hurry. That's bad!"
5269. 
5270. He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only
5271. and not with his eyes.
5272. 
5273. "You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible," he said.
5274. 
5275. The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was
5276. silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and
5277. she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and
5278. she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings
5279. from various people and retailing the town gossip.
5280. 
5281. "Countess Apraksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried
5282. her eyes out," she said, growing more and more lively.
5283. 
5284. As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly,
5285. and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a
5286. definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Ivanovich.
5287. 
5288. "Well, Michael Ivanovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it.
5289. Prince Andrew" (he always spoke thus of his son) "has been telling
5290. me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I never
5291. thought much of him."
5292. 
5293. Michael Ivanovich did not at all know when "you and I" had said such
5294. things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on
5295. which to hang the prince's favorite topic, he looked inquiringly at the
5296. young prince, wondering what would follow.
5297. 
5298. "He is a great tactician!" said the prince to his son, pointing to the
5299. architect.
5300. 
5301. And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the
5302. generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not
5303. only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the
5304. A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant
5305. little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any
5306. Potemkins or Suvorovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced that
5307. there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war, but
5308. only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing,
5309. pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his
5310. father's ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him
5311. with evident pleasure.
5312. 
5313. "The past always seems good," said he, "but did not Suvorov himself
5314. fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to
5315. escape?"
5316. 
5317. "Who told you that? Who?" cried the prince. "Suvorov!" And he jerked
5318. away his plate, which Tikhon briskly caught. "Suvorov!... Consider,
5319. Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suvorov; Moreau!... Moreau would
5320. have been a prisoner if Suvorov had had a free hand; but he had the
5321. Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have puzzled
5322. the devil himself! When you get there you'll find out what those
5323. Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suvorov couldn't manage them so what chance
5324. has Michael Kutuzov? No, my dear boy," he continued, "you and your
5325. generals won't get on against Buonaparte; you'll have to call in the
5326. French, so that birds of a feather may fight together. The German,
5327. Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchman,
5328. Moreau," he said, alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau
5329. to enter the Russian service.... "Wonderful!... Were the Potemkins,
5330. Suvorovs, and Orlovs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows have all lost
5331. your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help you, but we'll see what
5332. will happen. Buonaparte has become a great commander among them! Hm!..."
5333. 
5334. "I don't at all say that all the plans are good," said Prince Andrew, "I
5335. am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You may laugh as much as
5336. you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!"
5337. 
5338. "Michael Ivanovich!" cried the old prince to the architect who, busy
5339. with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: "Didn't I tell you
5340. Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing."
5341. 
5342. "To be sure, your excellency," replied the architect.
5343. 
5344. The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.
5345. 
5346. "Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got
5347. splendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only
5348. idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody
5349. has beaten the Germans. They beat no one--except one another. He made
5350. his reputation fighting them."
5351. 
5352. And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to
5353. him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His
5354. son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were
5355. presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He
5356. listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this
5357. old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and
5358. discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and
5359. political events.
5360. 
5361. "You think I'm an old man and don't understand the present state of
5362. affairs?" concluded his father. "But it troubles me. I don't sleep
5363. at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his
5364. skill?" he concluded.
5365. 
5366. "That would take too long to tell," answered the son.
5367. 
5368. "Well, then go to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, here's
5369. another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours," he exclaimed in
5370. excellent French.
5371. 
5372. "You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!"
5373. 
5374. "Dieu sait quand reviendra..." hummed the prince out of tune and, with a
5375. laugh still more so, he quitted the table.
5376. 
5377. The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of
5378. the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her
5379. father-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she
5380. took her sister-in-law's arm and drew her into another room.
5381. 
5382. "What a clever man your father is," said she; "perhaps that is why I am
5383. afraid of him."
5384. 
5385. "Oh, he is so kind!" answered Princess Mary.
5386. 
5387. 
5388. 
5389. 
5390. 
5391. CHAPTER XXVIII
5392. 
5393. 
5394. Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering
5395. his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was
5396. in her sister-in-law's room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without
5397. epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him.
5398. After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he
5399. ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept
5400. with him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted with
5401. silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber--a present from his
5402. father who had brought it from the siege of Ochakov. All these traveling
5403. effects of Prince Andrew's were in very good order: new, clean, and in
5404. cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.
5405. 
5406. When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable
5407. of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments
5408. one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew's face
5409. looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced
5410. briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him
5411. and thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was
5412. he sad at leaving his wife?--perhaps both, but evidently he did not
5413. wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he
5414. hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the
5415. cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable
5416. expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.
5417. 
5418. "I hear you have given orders to harness," she cried, panting (she had
5419. apparently been running), "and I did so wish to have another talk with
5420. you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not angry
5421. with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrusha," she added, as if to
5422. explain such a question.
5423. 
5424. She smiled as she uttered his pet name, "Andrusha." It was obviously
5425. strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be
5426. Andrusha--the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in
5427. childhood.
5428. 
5429. "And where is Lise?" he asked, answering her question only by a smile.
5430. 
5431. "She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room. Oh,
5432. Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have," said she, sitting down on
5433. the sofa, facing her brother. "She is quite a child: such a dear, merry
5434. child. I have grown so fond of her."
5435. 
5436. Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and
5437. contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.
5438. 
5439. "One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,
5440. Andrew? Don't forget that she has grown up and been educated in
5441. society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into
5442. everyone's situation. Tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner. * Think
5443. what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to,
5444. to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her
5445. condition! It's very hard."
5446. 
5447. 
5448.      * To understand all is to forgive all.
5449. 
5450. 
5451. Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we
5452. think we thoroughly understand.
5453. 
5454. "You live in the country and don't think the life terrible," he replied.
5455. 
5456. "I... that's different. Why speak of me? I don't want any other life,
5457. and can't, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young society
5458. woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life,
5459. all alone--for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what poor
5460. resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society.
5461. There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne...."
5462. 
5463. "I don't like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all," said Prince Andrew.
5464. 
5465. "No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she's much to be pitied.
5466. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don't need her, and she's
5467. even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am even more
5468. so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael
5469. Ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind,
5470. because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: 'We don't
5471. love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we
5472. have done them.' Father took her when she was homeless after losing her
5473. own father. She is very good-natured, and my father likes her way of
5474. reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly."
5475. 
5476. "To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father's character sometimes makes
5477. things trying for you, doesn't it?" Prince Andrew asked suddenly.
5478. 
5479. Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.
5480. 
5481. "For me? For me?... Trying for me!..." said she.
5482. 
5483. "He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he's getting very
5484. trying," said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father
5485. in order to puzzle or test his sister.
5486. 
5487. "You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual
5488. pride," said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts
5489. rather than the trend of the conversation--"and that's a great sin.
5490. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except
5491. veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented
5492. and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I am."
5493. 
5494. Her brother shook his head incredulously.
5495. 
5496. "The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,
5497. Andrew... is Father's way of treating religious subjects. I don't
5498. understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is
5499. as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing
5500. that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of
5501. improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a
5502. monk he received and had a long talk with."
5503. 
5504. "Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder,"
5505. said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.
5506. 
5507. "Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me. Andrew..."
5508. she said timidly after a moment's silence, "I have a great favor to ask
5509. of you."
5510. 
5511. "What is it, dear?"
5512. 
5513. "No--promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble
5514. and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,
5515. Andrusha!..." said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet
5516. taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were
5517. the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was
5518. granted.
5519. 
5520. She looked timidly at her brother.
5521. 
5522. "Even if it were a great deal of trouble..." answered Prince Andrew, as
5523. if guessing what it was about.
5524. 
5525. "Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as
5526. you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father's father, our
5527. grandfather, wore it in all his wars." (She still did not take out what
5528. she was holding in her reticule.) "So you promise?"
5529. 
5530. "Of course. What is it?"
5531. 
5532. "Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will
5533. never take it off. Do you promise?"
5534. 
5535. "If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won't break my neck... To
5536. please you..." said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the pained
5537. expression his joke had brought to his sister's face, he repented and
5538. added: "I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad."
5539. 
5540. "Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you
5541. to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace," said she in a voice
5542. trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her
5543. brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold
5544. setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.
5545. 
5546. She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.
5547. 
5548. "Please, Andrew, for my sake!..."
5549. 
5550. Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit
5551. up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother
5552. would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood,
5553. crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for
5554. he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.
5555. 
5556. "Thank you, my dear." She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again
5557. on the sofa. They were silent for a while.
5558. 
5559. "As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always
5560. used to be. Don't judge Lise harshly," she began. "She is so sweet, so
5561. good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one."
5562. 
5563. "I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Masha, or blamed
5564. her. Why do you say all this to me?"
5565. 
5566. Red patches appeared on Princess Mary's face and she was silent as if
5567. she felt guilty.
5568. 
5569. "I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And I
5570. am sorry for that," he went on.
5571. 
5572. The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to
5573. say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little
5574. princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings
5575. about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her
5576. fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen
5577. asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.
5578. 
5579. "Know this, Masha: I can't reproach, have not reproached, and never
5580. shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself
5581. with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever
5582. circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if
5583. you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this
5584. is so I don't know..."
5585. 
5586. As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed
5587. her forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and
5588. unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over
5589. her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.
5590. 
5591. "Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or--go and wake and I'll come
5592. in a moment. Petrushka!" he called to his valet: "Come here, take these
5593. away. Put this on the seat and this to the right."
5594. 
5595. Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:
5596. "Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him
5597. to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been
5598. answered."
5599. 
5600. "Well, may be!" said Prince Andrew. "Go, Masha; I'll come immediately."
5601. 
5602. On the way to his sister's room, in the passage which connected one
5603. wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling
5604. sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and
5605. artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.
5606. 
5607. "Oh! I thought you were in your room," she said, for some reason
5608. blushing and dropping her eyes.
5609. 
5610. Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly
5611. came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead
5612. and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the
5613. Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his
5614. sister's room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying
5615. one word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as
5616. usual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make
5617. up for lost time.
5618. 
5619. "No, but imagine the old Countess Zubova, with false curls and her mouth
5620. full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age.... Ha, ha,
5621. ha! Mary!"
5622. 
5623. This very sentence about Countess Zubova and this same laugh Prince
5624. Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some
5625. five times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and
5626. rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking
5627. incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince
5628. Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after
5629. their journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.
5630. 
5631. The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn
5632. night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.
5633. Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense
5634. house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The
5635. domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to
5636. the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in
5637. the reception hall: Michael Ivanovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess
5638. Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his
5639. father's study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All
5640. were waiting for them to come out.
5641. 
5642. When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age
5643. spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his
5644. son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.
5645. 
5646. "Going?" And he went on writing.
5647. 
5648. "I've come to say good-by."
5649. 
5650. "Kiss me here," and he touched his cheek: "Thanks, thanks!"
5651. 
5652. "What do you thank me for?"
5653. 
5654. "For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman's apron strings. The
5655. Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!" And he went on writing, so
5656. that his quill spluttered and squeaked. "If you have anything to say,
5657. say it. These two things can be done together," he added.
5658. 
5659. "About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands..."
5660. 
5661. "Why talk nonsense? Say what you want."
5662. 
5663. "When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let
5664. him be here...."
5665. 
5666. The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his
5667. stern eyes on his son.
5668. 
5669. "I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work," said
5670. Prince Andrew, evidently confused. "I know that out of a million cases
5671. only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been
5672. telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened."
5673. 
5674. "Hm... Hm..." muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was
5675. writing. "I'll do it."
5676. 
5677. He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
5678. laugh.
5679. 
5680. "It's a bad business, eh?"
5681. 
5682. "What is bad, Father?"
5683. 
5684. "The wife!" said the old prince, briefly and significantly.
5685. 
5686. "I don't understand!" said Prince Andrew.
5687. 
5688. "No, it can't be helped, lad," said the prince. "They're all like that;
5689. one can't unmarry. Don't be afraid; I won't tell anyone, but you know it
5690. yourself."
5691. 
5692. He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked
5693. straight into his son's face with keen eyes which seemed to see through
5694. him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.
5695. 
5696. The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The
5697. old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing
5698. down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.
5699. 
5700. "What's to be done? She's pretty! I will do everything. Make your mind
5701. easy," said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.
5702. 
5703. Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father
5704. understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.
5705. 
5706. "Listen!" said he; "don't worry about your wife: what can be done shall
5707. be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilarionovich. * I have
5708. written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you
5709. long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember and like him.
5710. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all right--serve
5711. him. Nicholas Bolkonski's son need not serve under anyone if he is in
5712. disfavor. Now come here."

5716. 
5717. 
5718. He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son
5719. was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the
5720. lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his
5721. bold, tall, close handwriting.
5722. 
5723. "I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;
5724. hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond and
5725. a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvorov's
5726. wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for you to read
5727. when I am gone. You will find them useful."
5728. 
5729. Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time
5730. yet. He felt that he must not say it.
5731. 
5732. "I will do it all, Father," he said.
5733. 
5734. "Well, now, good-by!" He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced
5735. him. "Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me,
5736. your old father..." he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous
5737. voice suddenly shrieked: "but if I hear that you have not behaved like a
5738. son of Nicholas Bolkonski, I shall be ashamed!"
5739. 
5740. "You need not have said that to me, Father," said the son with a smile.
5741. 
5742. The old man was silent.
5743. 
5744. "I also wanted to ask you," continued Prince Andrew, "if I'm killed
5745. and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you--as I said
5746. yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please."
5747. 
5748. "Not let the wife have him?" said the old man, and laughed.
5749. 
5750. They stood silent, facing one another. The old man's sharp eyes were
5751. fixed straight on his son's. Something twitched in the lower part of the
5752. old prince's face.
5753. 
5754. "We've said good-by. Go!" he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry voice,
5755. opening his door.
5756. 
5757. "What is it? What?" asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at
5758. the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing
5759. gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.
5760. 
5761. Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.
5762. 
5763. "Well!" he said, turning to his wife.
5764. 
5765. And this "Well!" sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying,: "Now go
5766. through your performance."
5767. 
5768. "Andrew, already!" said the little princess, turning pale and looking
5769. with dismay at her husband.
5770. 
5771. He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.
5772. 
5773. He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,
5774. and carefully placed her in an easy chair.
5775. 
5776. "Adieu, Mary," said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand and
5777. kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.
5778. 
5779. The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing
5780. her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked
5781. with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince
5782. Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From
5783. the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man
5784. angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study
5785. door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white
5786. dressing gown looked out.
5787. 
5788. "Gone? That's all right!" said he; and looking angrily at the
5789. unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed
5790. the door.

5802. CHAPTER I
5803. 
5804. 
5805. In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of
5806. the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from
5807. Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the
5808. inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the headquarters of
5809. the commander-in-chief, Kutuzov.
5810. 
5811. On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached
5812. Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected
5813. by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the
5814. locality and surroundings--fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and
5815. hills in the distance--and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who
5816. gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment
5817. had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an
5818. inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.
5819. 
5820. On the evening of the last day's march an order had been received that
5821. the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though
5822. the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and
5823. the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or
5824. not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders
5825. to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is
5826. always better to "bow too low than not bow low enough." So the soldiers,
5827. after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long
5828. without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders
5829. calculated and reckoned, and by morning the regiment--instead of the
5830. straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day
5831. before--presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom
5832. knew his place and his duty, had every button and every strap in place,
5833. and shone with cleanliness. And not only externally was all in order,
5834. but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he
5835. would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the
5836. appointed number of articles, "awl, soap, and all," as the soldiers
5837. say. There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at
5838. ease. It was the state of the soldiers' boots. More than half the men's
5839. boots were in holes. But this defect was not due to any fault of the
5840. regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not
5841. been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched
5842. some seven hundred miles.
5843. 
5844. The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and
5845. thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from
5846. chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform
5847. showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes
5848. which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He
5849. had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of
5850. his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled
5851. himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander
5852. admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was
5853. engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military
5854. matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his
5855. thoughts.
5856. 
5857. "Well, Michael Mitrich, sir?" he said, addressing one of the battalion
5858. commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that they both
5859. felt happy). "We had our hands full last night. However, I think the
5860. regiment is not a bad one, eh?"
5861. 
5862. The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.
5863. 
5864. "It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsaritsin Meadow."
5865. 
5866. "What?" asked the commander.
5867. 
5868. At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been
5869. posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-de-camp
5870. followed by a Cossack.
5871. 
5872. The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been
5873. clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief
5874. wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on
5875. the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation
5876. whatever.
5877. 
5878. A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutuzov the day
5879. before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army
5880. of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutuzov, not considering this
5881. junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view,
5882. to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops
5883. arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment;
5884. so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander
5885. in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these
5886. circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the
5887. men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the
5888. commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the
5889. regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and
5890. spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.
5891. 
5892. "A fine mess we've made of it!" he remarked.
5893. 
5894. "There now! Didn't I tell you, Michael Mitrich, that if it was said
5895. 'on the march' it meant in greatcoats?" said he reproachfully to
5896. the battalion commander. "Oh, my God!" he added, stepping resolutely
5897. forward. "Company commanders!" he shouted in a voice accustomed to
5898. command. "Sergeants major!... How soon will he be here?" he asked the
5899. aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the
5900. personage he was referring to.
5901. 
5902. "In an hour's time, I should say."
5903. 
5904. "Shall we have time to change clothes?"
5905. 
5906. "I don't know, General...."
5907. 
5908. The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the
5909. soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off
5910. to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats
5911. were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up
5912. to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and
5913. hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing
5914. up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps
5915. over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on
5916. with upraised arms.
5917. 
5918. In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray
5919. instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps
5920. to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.
5921. 
5922. "Whatever is this? This!" he shouted and stood still. "Commander of the
5923. third company!"
5924. 
5925. "Commander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to
5926. the general... third company to the commander." The words passed along
5927. the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.
5928. 
5929. When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a
5930. cry of: "The general to the third company," the missing officer appeared
5931. from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man and not in
5932. the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the
5933. general. The captain's face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is
5934. told to repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots appeared on his nose,
5935. the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth
5936. twitched nervously. The general looked the captain up and down as he
5937. came up panting, slackening his pace as he approached.
5938. 
5939. "You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?"
5940. shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing
5941. at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish
5942. cloth, which contrasted with the others. "What have you been after? The
5943. commander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? I'll teach
5944. you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?"
5945. 
5946. The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior,
5947. pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this
5948. pressure lay his only hope of salvation.
5949. 
5950. "Well, why don't you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a
5951. Hungarian?" said the commander with an austere gibe.
5952. 
5953. "Your excellency..."
5954. 
5955. "Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your
5956. excellency?... nobody knows."
5957. 
5958. "Your excellency, it's the officer Dolokhov, who has been reduced to the
5959. ranks," said the captain softly.
5960. 
5961. "Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier? If
5962. a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others."
5963. 
5964. "Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march."
5965. 
5966. "Gave him leave? Leave? That's just like you young men," said the
5967. regimental commander cooling down a little. "Leave indeed.... One says
5968. a word to you and you... What?" he added with renewed irritation, "I beg
5969. you to dress your men decently."
5970. 
5971. And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky
5972. steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display of
5973. anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for
5974. wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another
5975. because his line was not straight, he reached the third company.
5976. 
5977. "H-o-o-w are you standing? Where's your leg? Your leg?" shouted the
5978. commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were still
5979. five men between him and Dolokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.
5980. 
5981. Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his
5982. clear, insolent eyes in the general's face.
5983. 
5984. "Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat... the
5985. ras..." he did not finish.
5986. 
5987. "General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure..." Dolokhov
5988. hurriedly interrupted.
5989. 
5990. "No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!"
5991. 
5992. "Not bound to endure insults," Dolokhov concluded in loud, ringing
5993. tones.
5994. 
5995. The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became silent,
5996. angrily pulling down his tight scarf.
5997. 
5998. "I request you to have the goodness to change your coat," he said as he
5999. turned away.
6000. 
6001. 
6002. 
6003. 
6004. 
6005. CHAPTER II
6006. 
6007. 
6008. "He's coming!" shouted the signaler at that moment.
6009. 
6010. The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup
6011. with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself,
6012. drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening
6013. his mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like a bird
6014. preening its plumage and became motionless.
6015. 
6016. "Att-ention!" shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice
6017. which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and welcome
6018. for the approaching chief.
6019. 
6020. Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high,
6021. light blue Viennese caleche, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn
6022. by six horses at a smart trot. Behind the caleche galloped the suite and
6023. a convoy of Croats. Beside Kutuzov sat an Austrian general, in a white
6024. uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones. The caleche
6025. stopped in front of the regiment. Kutuzov and the Austrian general were
6026. talking in low voices and Kutuzov smiled slightly as treading heavily
6027. he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men
6028. breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist.
6029. 
6030. The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a
6031. jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the feeble
6032. voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared, "Health
6033. to your ex... len... len... lency!" and again all became silent. At
6034. first Kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved; then he and the
6035. general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks.
6036. 
6037. From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and
6038. devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from
6039. the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward
6040. and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he
6041. darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief,
6042. it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even
6043. greater zeal than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and
6044. assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that
6045. had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition. There
6046. were only 217 sick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except
6047. the boots.
6048. 
6049. Kutuzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few
6050. friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes
6051. also to the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his
6052. head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression
6053. which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help
6054. noticing what a bad state of things it was. The regimental commander
6055. ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of
6056. the commander in chief's regarding the regiment. Behind Kutuzov, at a
6057. distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed
6058. some twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen talked among themselves
6059. and sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a
6060. handsome adjutant. This was Prince Bolkonski. Beside him was his
6061. comrade Nesvitski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a kindly,
6062. smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. Nesvitski could hardly keep from
6063. laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him.
6064. This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the
6065. expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental commander's back
6066. and mimicked his every movement. Each time the commander started and
6067. bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same
6068. manner. Nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the
6069. wag.
6070. 
6071. Kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were
6072. starting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the
6073. third company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this,
6074. involuntarily came closer to him.
6075. 
6076. "Ah, Timokhin!" said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been
6077. reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.
6078. 
6079. One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself
6080. more than Timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental
6081. commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew
6082. himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained
6083. it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kutuzov,
6084. who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good,
6085. quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his
6086. scarred and puffy face.
6087. 
6088. "Another Ismail comrade," said he. "A brave officer! Are you satisfied
6089. with him?" he asked the regimental commander.
6090. 
6091. And the latter--unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar
6092. officer as in a looking glass--started, moved forward, and answered:
6093. "Highly satisfied, your excellency!"
6094. 
6095. "We all have our weaknesses," said Kutuzov smiling and walking away from
6096. him. "He used to have a predilection for Bacchus."
6097. 
6098. The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did
6099. not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed
6100. captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose
6101. with such exactitude that Nesvitski could not help laughing. Kutuzov
6102. turned round. The officer evidently had complete control of his face,
6103. and while Kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume
6104. a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.
6105. 
6106. The third company was the last, and Kutuzov pondered, apparently trying
6107. to recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the
6108. suite and said in French:
6109. 
6110. "You told me to remind you of the officer Dolokhov, reduced to the ranks
6111. in this regiment."
6112. 
6113. "Where is Dolokhov?" asked Kutuzov.
6114. 
6115. Dolokhov, who had already changed into a soldier's gray greatcoat, did
6116. not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired soldier,
6117. with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the
6118. commander in chief, and presented arms.
6119. 
6120. "Have you a complaint to make?" Kutuzov asked with a slight frown.
6121. 
6122. "This is Dolokhov," said Prince Andrew.
6123. 
6124. "Ah!" said Kutuzov. "I hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your duty.
6125. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan't forget you if you deserve well."
6126. 
6127. The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as
6128. they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression
6129. to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief
6130. so widely from a private.
6131. 
6132. "One thing I ask of your excellency," Dolokhov said in his firm,
6133. ringing, deliberate voice. "I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
6134. and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!"
6135. 
6136. Kutuzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had turned
6137. from Captain Timokhin again flitted over his face. He turned away with
6138. a grimace as if to say that everything Dolokhov had said to him and
6139. everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was weary of
6140. it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and went to the
6141. carriage.
6142. 
6143. The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed
6144. quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and
6145. to rest after their hard marches.
6146. 
6147. "You won't bear me a grudge, Prokhor Ignatych?" said the regimental
6148. commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and
6149. riding up to Captain Timokhin who was walking in front. (The regimental
6150. commander's face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with
6151. irrepressible delight.) "It's in the Emperor's service... it can't be
6152. helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade... I am the first to
6153. apologize, you know me!... He was very pleased!" And he held out his
6154. hand to the captain.
6155. 
6156. "Don't mention it, General, as if I'd be so bold!" replied the captain,
6157. his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front
6158. teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at
6159. Ismail.
6160. 
6161. "And tell Mr. Dolokhov that I won't forget him--he may be quite easy.
6162. And tell me, please--I've been meaning to ask--how is he behaving
6163. himself, and in general..."
6164. 
6165. "As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency;
6166. but his character..." said Timokhin.
6167. 
6168. "And what about his character?" asked the regimental commander.
6169. 
6170. "It's different on different days," answered the captain. "One day he
6171. is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he's a wild
6172. beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew."
6173. 
6174. "Oh, well, well!" remarked the regimental commander. "Still, one must
6175. have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important
6176. connections... Well, then, you just..."
6177. 
6178. "I will, your excellency," said Timokhin, showing by his smile that he
6179. understood his commander's wish.
6180. 
6181. "Well, of course, of course!"
6182. 
6183. The regimental commander sought out Dolokhov in the ranks and, reining
6184. in his horse, said to him:
6185. 
6186. "After the next affair... epaulettes."
6187. 
6188. Dolokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking
6189. smile on his lips change.
6190. 
6191. "Well, that's all right," continued the regimental commander. "A cup of
6192. vodka for the men from me," he added so that the soldiers could hear.
6193. "I thank you all! God be praised!" and he rode past that company and
6194. overtook the next one.
6195. 
6196. "Well, he's really a good fellow, one can serve under him," said
6197. Timokhin to the subaltern beside him.
6198. 
6199. "In a word, a hearty one..." said the subaltern, laughing (the
6200. regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).
6201. 
6202. The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the
6203. soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers' voices could be
6204. heard on every side.
6205. 
6206. "And they said Kutuzov was blind of one eye?"
6207. 
6208. "And so he is! Quite blind!"
6209. 
6210. "No, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands... he
6211. noticed everything..."
6212. 
6213. "When he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I..."
6214. 
6215. "And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were smeared
6216. with chalk--as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as they do
6217. the guns."
6218. 
6219. "I say, Fedeshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You were
6220. near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau."
6221. 
6222. "Buonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn't know!
6223. The Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are putting
6224. them down. When they've been put down, the war with Buonaparte will
6225. begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you're a fool. You'd
6226. better listen more carefully!"
6227. 
6228. "What devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is turning
6229. into the village already... they will have their buckwheat cooked before
6230. we reach our quarters."
6231. 
6232. "Give me a biscuit, you devil!"
6233. 
6234. "And did you give me tobacco yesterday? That's just it, friend! Ah,
6235. well, never mind, here you are."
6236. 
6237. "They might call a halt here or we'll have to do another four miles
6238. without eating."
6239. 
6240. "Wasn't it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still and
6241. are drawn along."
6242. 
6243. "And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all seemed
6244. to be Poles--all under the Russian crown--but here they're all regular
6245. Germans."
6246. 
6247. "Singers to the front" came the captain's order.
6248. 
6249. And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A
6250. drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing
6251. his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers' song, commencing with the
6252. words: "Morning dawned, the sun was rising," and concluding: "On then,
6253. brothers, on to glory, led by Father Kamenski." This song had been
6254. composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only
6255. change being that the words "Father Kamenski" were replaced by "Father
6256. Kutuzov."
6257. 
6258. Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms
6259. as if flinging something to the ground, the drummer--a lean, handsome
6260. soldier of forty--looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes.
6261. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him, he raised
6262. both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object
6263. above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly flung it
6264. down and began:
6265. 
6266. "Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!"
6267. 
6268. "Oh, my bower new...!" chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet player,
6269. in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front
6270. and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and
6271. flourished his castanets as if threatening someone. The soldiers,
6272. swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long
6273. steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs,
6274. and the tramp of horses' hoofs were heard. Kutuzov and his suite were
6275. returning to the town. The commander in chief made a sign that the
6276. men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed
6277. pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing
6278. soldier and the gay and smartly marching men. In the second file
6279. from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company,
6280. a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was Dolokhov
6281. marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and
6282. looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that
6283. moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of Kutuzov's suite
6284. who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the carriage
6285. and rode up to Dolokhov.
6286. 
6287. Hussar cornet Zherkov had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to the
6288. wild set led by Dolokhov. Zherkov had met Dolokhov abroad as a private
6289. and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that Kutuzov had spoken
6290. to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of an old
6291. friend.
6292. 
6293. "My dear fellow, how are you?" said he through the singing, making his
6294. horse keep pace with the company.
6295. 
6296. "How am I?" Dolokhov answered coldly. "I am as you see."
6297. 
6298. The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy
6299. gaiety with which Zherkov spoke, and to the intentional coldness of
6300. Dolokhov's reply.
6301. 
6302. "And how do you get on with the officers?" inquired Zherkov.
6303. 
6304. "All right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto the
6305. staff?"
6306. 
6307. "I was attached; I'm on duty."
6308. 
6309. Both were silent.
6310. 
6311. "She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve," went the song,
6312. arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness. Their
6313. conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of
6314. that song.
6315. 
6316. "Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?" asked Dolokhov.
6317. 
6318. "The devil only knows! They say so."
6319. 
6320. "I'm glad," answered Dolokhov briefly and clearly, as the song demanded.
6321. 
6322. "I say, come round some evening and we'll have a game of faro!" said
6323. Zherkov.
6324. 
6325. "Why, have you too much money?"
6326. 
6327. "Do come."
6328. 
6329. "I can't. I've sworn not to. I won't drink and won't play till I get
6330. reinstated."
6331. 
6332. "Well, that's only till the first engagement."
6333. 
6334. "We shall see."
6335. 
6336. They were again silent.
6337. 
6338. "Come if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the staff..."
6339. 
6340. Dolokhov smiled. "Don't trouble. If I want anything, I won't beg--I'll
6341. take it!"
6342. 
6343. "Well, never mind; I only..."
6344. 
6345. "And I only..."
6346. 
6347. "Good-by."
6348. 
6349. "Good health..."
6350. 
6351.         "It's a long, long way.
6352.         To my native land..."
6353. 
6354. 
6355. Zherkov touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from foot
6356. to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped past
6357. the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the song.
6358. 
6359. 
6360. 
6361. 
6362. 
6363. CHAPTER III
6364. 
6365. 
6366. On returning from the review, Kutuzov took the Austrian general into his
6367. private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers relating
6368. to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the letters that
6369. had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of the advanced
6370. army. Prince Andrew Bolkonski came into the room with the required
6371. papers. Kutuzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were
6372. sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.
6373. 
6374. "Ah!..." said Kutuzov glancing at Bolkonski as if by this exclamation he
6375. was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the conversation in
6376. French.
6377. 
6378. "All I can say, General," said he with a pleasant elegance of expression
6379. and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken
6380. word. It was evident that Kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his
6381. own voice. "All I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my
6382. personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have
6383. been fulfilled long ago. I should long ago have joined the archduke. And
6384. believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure
6385. to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better
6386. informed and more skillful general--of whom Austria has so many--and to
6387. lay down all this heavy responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes
6388. too strong for us, General."
6389. 
6390. And Kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, "You are quite at
6391. liberty not to believe me and I don't even care whether you do or not,
6392. but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole point."
6393. 
6394. The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply
6395. in the same tone.
6396. 
6397. "On the contrary," he said, in a querulous and angry tone that
6398. contrasted with his flattering words, "on the contrary, your
6399. excellency's participation in the common action is highly valued by
6400. His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid
6401. Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been
6402. accustomed to win in their battles," he concluded his evidently
6403. prearranged sentence.
6404. 
6405. Kutuzov bowed with the same smile.
6406. 
6407. "But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which
6408. His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the
6409. Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General
6410. Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need
6411. our aid," said Kutuzov.
6412. 
6413. The general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian
6414. defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors
6415. that were afloat, and so Kutuzov's suggestion of an Austrian victory
6416. sounded much like irony. But Kutuzov went on blandly smiling with the
6417. same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so.
6418. And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mack's army informed
6419. him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was
6420. very favorable.
6421. 
6422. "Give me that letter," said Kutuzov turning to Prince Andrew. "Please
6423. have a look at it"--and Kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners
6424. of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in
6425. German, from the Archduke Ferdinand's letter:
6426. 
6427. 
6428. We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with
6429. which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also,
6430. as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of
6431. commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not
6432. cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line
6433. of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his
6434. intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful
6435. ally. We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial
6436. Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with
6437. it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.
6438. 
6439. 
6440. Kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the
6441. member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.
6442. 
6443. "But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect the
6444. worst," said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done with
6445. jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round at the
6446. aide-de-camp.
6447. 
6448. "Excuse me, General," interrupted Kutuzov, also turning to Prince
6449. Andrew. "Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlovski all the reports
6450. from our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one
6451. from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these," he said,
6452. handing him several papers, "make a neat memorandum in French out of all
6453. this, showing all the news we have had of the movements of the Austrian
6454. army, and then give it to his excellency."
6455. 
6456. Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the
6457. first not only what had been said but also what Kutuzov would have liked
6458. to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both, stepped
6459. softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.
6460. 
6461. Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he
6462. had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face,
6463. in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former
6464. affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time
6465. to think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with
6466. agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed more satisfaction
6467. with himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter
6468. and more attractive.
6469. 
6470. Kutuzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly,
6471. promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants,
6472. and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions.
6473. From Vienna Kutuzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrew's father.
6474. 
6475. 
6476. Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry,
6477. firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have such a
6478. subordinate by me.
6479. 
6480. 
6481. On Kutuzov's staff, among his fellow officers and in the army generally,
6482. Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two quite
6483. opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be different
6484. from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things of him,
6485. listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince
6486. Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and
6487. considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people
6488. Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even
6489. feared him.
6490. 
6491. Coming out of Kutuzov's room into the waiting room with the papers in
6492. his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty,
6493. Kozlovski, who was sitting at the window with a book.
6494. 
6495. "Well, Prince?" asked Kozlovski.
6496. 
6497. "I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
6498. advancing."
6499. 
6500. "And why is it?"
6501. 
6502. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.
6503. 
6504. "Any news from Mack?"
6505. 
6506. "No."
6507. 
6508. "If it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come."
6509. 
6510. "Probably," said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.
6511. 
6512. But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the
6513. order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head,
6514. who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door.
6515. Prince Andrew stopped short.
6516. 
6517. "Commander in Chief Kutuzov?" said the newly arrived general speaking
6518. quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and advancing
6519. straight toward the inner door.
6520. 
6521. "The commander in chief is engaged," said Kozlovski, going hurriedly up
6522. to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door. "Whom shall I
6523. announce?"
6524. 
6525. The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlovski, who was
6526. rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.
6527. 
6528. "The commander in chief is engaged," repeated Kozlovski calmly.
6529. 
6530. The general's face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took out
6531. a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the leaf,
6532. gave it to Kozlovski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw himself
6533. into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, "Why do they
6534. look at me?" Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as if he
6535. intended to say something, but immediately, with affected indifference,
6536. began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which immediately broke
6537. off. The door of the private room opened and Kutuzov appeared in the
6538. doorway. The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though
6539. running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides with his
6540. thin legs, went up to Kutuzov.
6541. 
6542. "Vous voyez le malheureux Mack," he uttered in a broken voice.
6543. 
6544. Kutuzov's face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
6545. immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave
6546. and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully,
6547. closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed
6548. the door himself behind him.
6549. 
6550. The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten
6551. and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct.
6552. Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with
6553. orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been
6554. inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.
6555. 
6556. Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest
6557. lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the
6558. details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost,
6559. understood all the difficulties of the Russian army's position, and
6560. vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to
6561. play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the
6562. humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week's time he might,
6563. perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the
6564. French since Suvorov met them. He feared that Bonaparte's genius might
6565. outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same time
6566. could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced.
6567. 
6568. Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his
6569. room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor
6570. he met Nesvitski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherkov; they
6571. were as usual laughing.
6572. 
6573. "Why are you so glum?" asked Nesvitski noticing Prince Andrew's pale
6574. face and glittering eyes.
6575. 
6576. "There's nothing to be gay about," answered Bolkonski.
6577. 
6578. Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvitski and Zherkov, there came toward them
6579. from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general who on
6580. Kutuzov's staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army, and
6581. the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening.
6582. There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the
6583. three officers quite easily, but Zherkov, pushing Nesvitski aside with
6584. his arm, said in a breathless voice,
6585. 
6586. "They're coming!... they're coming!... Stand aside, make way, please
6587. make way!"
6588. 
6589. The generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid
6590. embarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherkov there suddenly
6591. appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.
6592. 
6593. "Your excellency," said he in German, stepping forward and addressing
6594. the Austrian general, "I have the honor to congratulate you."
6595. 
6596. He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the
6597. other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.
6598. 
6599. The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing
6600. the seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment's
6601. attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.
6602. 
6603. "I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite
6604. well, only a little bruised just here," he added, pointing with a
6605. beaming smile to his head.
6606. 
6607. The general frowned, turned away, and went on.
6608. 
6609. "Gott, wie naiv!" * said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.
6610. 
6611. 
6612.      * "Good God, what simplicity!"
6613. 
6614. 
6615. Nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but
6616. Bolkonski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and
6617. turned to Zherkov. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of
6618. Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the
6619. Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkov's untimely jest.
6620. 
6621. "If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself," he said sharply,
6622. with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, "I can't prevent your doing
6623. so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence, I
6624. will teach you to behave yourself."
6625. 
6626. Nesvitski and Zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed
6627. at Bolkonski silently with wide-open eyes.
6628. 
6629. "What's the matter? I only congratulated them," said Zherkov.
6630. 
6631. "I am not jesting with you; please be silent!" cried Bolkonski, and
6632. taking Nesvitski's arm he left Zherkov, who did not know what to say.
6633. 
6634. "Come, what's the matter, old fellow?" said Nesvitski trying to soothe
6635. him.
6636. 
6637. "What's the matter?" exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his
6638. excitement. "Don't you understand that either we are officers serving
6639. our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at
6640. the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely lackeys who care
6641. nothing for their master's business. Quarante mille hommes massacres et
6642. l'armee de nos allies detruite, et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire," *
6643. he said, as if strengthening his views by this French sentence. "C'est
6644. bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un
6645. ami, mais pas pour vous, pas pour vous. *(2) Only a hobbledehoy could
6646. amuse himself in this way," he added in Russian--but pronouncing the
6647. word with a French accent--having noticed that Zherkov could still hear
6648. him.
6649. 
6650. 
6651.      * "Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies
6652.      destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!"
6653. 
6654.      * (2) "It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow
6655.      of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for
6656.      you."
6657. 
6658. 
6659. He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned
6660. and went out of the corridor.
6661. 
6662. 
6663. 
6664. 
6665. 
6666. CHAPTER IV
6667. 
6668. 
6669. The Pavlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The
6670. squadron in which Nicholas Rostov served as a cadet was quartered in
6671. the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were
6672. assigned to cavalry-captain Denisov, the squadron commander, known
6673. throughout the whole cavalry division as Vaska Denisov. Cadet Rostov,
6674. ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the
6675. squadron commander.
6676. 
6677. On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news
6678. of Mack's defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was
6679. proceeding as usual. Denisov, who had been losing at cards all night,
6680. had not yet come home when Rostov rode back early in the morning from
6681. a foraging expedition. Rostov in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his
6682. horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple
6683. youthful movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to
6684. part from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.
6685. 
6686. "Ah, Bondarenko, dear friend!" said he to the hussar who rushed up
6687. headlong to the horse. "Walk him up and down, my dear fellow," he
6688. continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young
6689. people show to everyone when they are happy.
6690. 
6691. "Yes, your excellency," answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his head.
6692. 
6693. "Mind, walk him up and down well!"
6694. 
6695. Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarenko had already
6696. thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse's head. It was
6697. evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid
6698. to serve him. Rostov patted the horse's neck and then his flank, and
6699. lingered for a moment.
6700. 
6701. "Splendid! What a horse he will be!" he thought with a smile, and
6702. holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the
6703. porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in
6704. hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face
6705. immediately brightened on seeing Rostov. "Schon gut Morgen! Schon gut
6706. Morgen!" * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased to
6707. greet the young man.
6708. 
6709. 
6710.     * "A very good morning! A very good morning!"
6711. 
6712. 
6713. "Schon fleissig?" * said Rostov with the same gay brotherly smile which
6714. did not leave his eager face. "Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser
6715. Alexander hoch!" *(2) said he, quoting words often repeated by the
6716. German landlord.
6717. 
6718. 
6719.     * "Busy already?"
6720. 
6721.     * (2) "Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians!
6722.      Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!"
6723. 
6724. 
6725. The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and
6726. waving it above his head cried:
6727. 
6728. "Und die ganze Welt hoch!" *
6729. 
6730. 
6731.     * "And hurrah for the whole world!"
6732. 
6733. 
6734. Rostov waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing,
6735. "Und vivat die ganze Welt!" Though neither the German cleaning his
6736. cowshed nor Rostov back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any
6737. reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and
6738. brotherly love, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection,
6739. and parted smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and Rostov going
6740. to the cottage he occupied with Denisov.
6741. 
6742. "What about your master?" he asked Lavrushka, Denisov's orderly, whom
6743. all the regiment knew for a rogue.
6744. 
6745. "Hasn't been in since the evening. Must have been losing," answered
6746. Lavrushka. "I know by now, if he wins he comes back early to brag about
6747. it, but if he stays out till morning it means he's lost and will come
6748. back in a rage. Will you have coffee?"
6749. 
6750. "Yes, bring some."
6751. 
6752. Ten minutes later Lavrushka brought the coffee. "He's coming!" said
6753. he. "Now for trouble!" Rostov looked out of the window and saw Denisov
6754. coming home. Denisov was a small man with a red face, sparkling black
6755. eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an unfastened cloak,
6756. wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled shako on the back
6757. of his head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging his head.
6758. 
6759. "Lavwuska!" he shouted loudly and angrily, "take it off, blockhead!"
6760. 
6761. "Well, I am taking it off," replied Lavrushka's voice.
6762. 
6763. "Ah, you're up already," said Denisov, entering the room.
6764. 
6765. "Long ago," answered Rostov, "I have already been for the hay, and have
6766. seen Fraulein Mathilde."
6767. 
6768. "Weally! And I've been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a damned
6769. fool!" cried Denisov, not pronouncing his r's. "Such ill luck! Such ill
6770. luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on. Hullo there! Tea!"
6771. 
6772. Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong
6773. teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick
6774. tangled black hair.
6775. 
6776. "And what devil made me go to that wat?" (an officer nicknamed "the
6777. rat") he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands.
6778. "Just fancy, he didn't let me win a single cahd, not one cahd."
6779. 
6780. He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his
6781. fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he
6782. continued to shout.
6783. 
6784. "He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it;
6785. gives the singles and snatches the doubles!"
6786. 
6787. He scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away.
6788. Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully
6789. with his glittering, black eyes at Rostov.
6790. 
6791. "If at least we had some women here; but there's nothing foh one to do
6792. but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who's there?"
6793. he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the
6794. clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful cough.
6795. 
6796. "The squadron quartermaster!" said Lavrushka.
6797. 
6798. Denisov's face puckered still more.
6799. 
6800. "Wetched!" he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it.
6801. "Wostov, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the
6802. purse undah the pillow," he said, and went out to the quartermaster.
6803. 
6804. Rostov took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins
6805. in separate piles, began counting them.
6806. 
6807. "Ah! Telyanin! How d'ye do? They plucked me last night," came Denisov's
6808. voice from the next room.
6809. 
6810. "Where? At Bykov's, at the rat's... I knew it," replied a piping voice,
6811. and Lieutenant Telyanin, a small officer of the same squadron, entered
6812. the room.
6813. 
6814. Rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand
6815. which was offered him. Telyanin for some reason had been transferred
6816. from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in
6817. the regiment but was not liked; Rostov especially detested him and was
6818. unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.
6819. 
6820. "Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?" he asked. (Rook was a
6821. young horse Telyanin had sold to Rostov.)
6822. 
6823. The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the
6824. face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.
6825. 
6826. "I saw you riding this morning..." he added.
6827. 
6828. "Oh, he's all right, a good horse," answered Rostov, though the horse
6829. for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum.
6830. "He's begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg," he added.
6831. 
6832. "The hoof's cracked! That's nothing. I'll teach you what to do and show
6833. you what kind of rivet to use."
6834. 
6835. "Yes, please do," said Rostov.
6836. 
6837. "I'll show you, I'll show you! It's not a secret. And it's a horse
6838. you'll thank me for."
6839. 
6840. "Then I'll have it brought round," said Rostov wishing to avoid
6841. Telyanin, and he went out to give the order.
6842. 
6843. In the passage Denisov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold
6844. facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing Rostov,
6845. Denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his
6846. thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting, he frowned and gave a
6847. shudder of disgust.
6848. 
6849. "Ugh! I don't like that fellow," he said, regardless of the
6850. quartermaster's presence.
6851. 
6852. Rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: "Nor do I, but what's
6853. one to do?" and, having given his order, he returned to Telyanin.
6854. 
6855. Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostov had left
6856. him, rubbing his small white hands.
6857. 
6858. "Well there certainly are disgusting people," thought Rostov as he
6859. entered.
6860. 
6861. "Have you told them to bring the horse?" asked Telyanin, getting up and
6862. looking carelessly about him.
6863. 
6864. "I have."
6865. 
6866. "Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denisov about yesterday's
6867. order. Have you got it, Denisov?"
6868. 
6869. "Not yet. But where are you off to?"
6870. 
6871. "I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse," said Telyanin.
6872. 
6873. They went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant
6874. explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.
6875. 
6876. When Rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the
6877. table. Denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of
6878. paper. He looked gloomily in Rostov's face and said: "I am witing to
6879. her."
6880. 
6881. He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and,
6882. evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to
6883. write, told Rostov the contents of his letter.
6884. 
6885. "You see, my fwiend," he said, "we sleep when we don't love. We are
6886. childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one is
6887. pua' as on the first day of cweation... Who's that now? Send him to the
6888. devil, I'm busy!" he shouted to Lavrushka, who went up to him not in the
6889. least abashed.
6890. 
6891. "Who should it be? You yourself told him to come. It's the quartermaster
6892. for the money."
6893. 
6894. Denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.
6895. 
6896. "Wetched business," he muttered to himself. "How much is left in the
6897. puhse?" he asked, turning to Rostov.
6898. 
6899. "Seven new and three old imperials."
6900. 
6901. "Oh, it's wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you sca'cwow?
6902. Call the quahtehmasteh," he shouted to Lavrushka.
6903. 
6904. "Please, Denisov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know," said
6905. Rostov, blushing.
6906. 
6907. "Don't like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don't," growled Denisov.
6908. 
6909. "But if you won't accept money from me like a comrade, you will offend
6910. me. Really I have some," Rostov repeated.
6911. 
6912. "No, I tell you."
6913. 
6914. And Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.
6915. 
6916. "Where have you put it, Wostov?"
6917. 
6918. "Under the lower pillow."
6919. 
6920. "It's not there."
6921. 
6922. Denisov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.
6923. 
6924. "That's a miwacle."
6925. 
6926. "Wait, haven't you dropped it?" said Rostov, picking up the pillows one
6927. at a time and shaking them.
6928. 
6929. He pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.
6930. 
6931. "Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept
6932. it under your head like a treasure," said Rostov. "I put it just here.
6933. Where is it?" he asked, turning to Lavrushka.
6934. 
6935. "I haven't been in the room. It must be where you put it."
6936. 
6937. "But it isn't?..."
6938. 
6939. "You're always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it.
6940. Feel in your pockets."
6941. 
6942. "No, if I hadn't thought of it being a treasure," said Rostov, "but I
6943. remember putting it there."
6944. 
6945. Lavrushka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under
6946. the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the
6947. room. Denisov silently watched Lavrushka's movements, and when the
6948. latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found
6949. Denisov glanced at Rostov.
6950. 
6951. "Wostov, you've not been playing schoolboy twicks..."
6952. 
6953. Rostov felt Denisov's gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and instantly
6954. dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere
6955. below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not draw breath.
6956. 
6957. "And there hasn't been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and
6958. yourselves. It must be here somewhere," said Lavrushka.
6959. 
6960. "Now then, you devil's puppet, look alive and hunt for it!" shouted
6961. Denisov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with a
6962. threatening gesture. "If the purse isn't found I'll flog you, I'll flog
6963. you all."
6964. 
6965. Rostov, his eyes avoiding Denisov, began buttoning his coat, buckled on
6966. his saber, and put on his cap.
6967. 
6968. "I must have that purse, I tell you," shouted Denisov, shaking his
6969. orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.
6970. 
6971. "Denisov, let him alone, I know who has taken it," said Rostov, going
6972. toward the door without raising his eyes. Denisov paused, thought a
6973. moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostov hinted at, seized his
6974. arm.
6975. 
6976. "Nonsense!" he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out
6977. like cords. "You are mad, I tell you. I won't allow it. The purse is
6978. here! I'll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be found."
6979. 
6980. "I know who has taken it," repeated Rostov in an unsteady voice, and
6981. went to the door.
6982. 
6983. "And I tell you, don't you dahe to do it!" shouted Denisov, rushing at
6984. the cadet to restrain him.
6985. 
6986. But Rostov pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though Denisov
6987. were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face.
6988. 
6989. "Do you understand what you're saying?" he said in a trembling voice.
6990. "There was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it is not
6991. so, then..."
6992. 
6993. He could not finish, and ran out of the room.
6994. 
6995. "Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody," were the last words Rostov
6996. heard.
6997. 
6998. Rostov went to Telyanin's quarters.
6999. 
7000. "The master is not in, he's gone to headquarters," said Telyanin's
7001. orderly. "Has something happened?" he added, surprised at the cadet's
7002. troubled face.
7003. 
7004. "No, nothing."
7005. 
7006. "You've only just missed him," said the orderly.
7007. 
7008. The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and
7009. Rostov, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was
7010. an inn in the village which the officers frequented. Rostov rode up to
7011. it and saw Telyanin's horse at the porch.
7012. 
7013. In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of
7014. sausages and a bottle of wine.
7015. 
7016. "Ah, you've come here too, young man!" he said, smiling and raising his
7017. eyebrows.
7018. 
7019. "Yes," said Rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word; and
7020. he sat down at the nearest table.
7021. 
7022. Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the
7023. room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives
7024. and the munching of the lieutenant.
7025. 
7026. When Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double
7027. purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up
7028. fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to
7029. the waiter.
7030. 
7031. "Please be quick," he said.
7032. 
7033. The coin was a new one. Rostov rose and went up to Telyanin.
7034. 
7035. "Allow me to look at your purse," he said in a low, almost inaudible,
7036. voice.
7037. 
7038. With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyanin handed him the
7039. purse.
7040. 
7041. "Yes, it's a nice purse. Yes, yes," he said, growing suddenly pale, and
7042. added, "Look at it, young man."
7043. 
7044. Rostov took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and
7045. looked at Telyanin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way
7046. and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.
7047. 
7048. "If we get to Vienna I'll get rid of it there but in these wretched
7049. little towns there's nowhere to spend it," said he. "Well, let me have
7050. it, young man, I'm going."
7051. 
7052. Rostov did not speak.
7053. 
7054. "And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite decently
7055. here," continued Telyanin. "Now then, let me have it."
7056. 
7057. He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostov let go of
7058. it. Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the
7059. pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth
7060. slightly open, as if to say, "Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my
7061. pocket and that's quite simple and is no one else's business."
7062. 
7063. "Well, young man?" he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted brows
7064. he glanced into Rostov's eyes.
7065. 
7066. Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanin's eyes to Rostov's
7067. and back, and back again and again in an instant.
7068. 
7069. "Come here," said Rostov, catching hold of Telyanin's arm and almost
7070. dragging him to the window. "That money is Denisov's; you took it..." he
7071. whispered just above Telyanin's ear.
7072. 
7073. "What? What? How dare you? What?" said Telyanin.
7074. 
7075. But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for
7076. pardon. As soon as Rostov heard them, an enormous load of doubt fell
7077. from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the
7078. miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be
7079. completed.
7080. 
7081. "Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine," muttered Telyanin,
7082. taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. "We must have an
7083. explanation..."
7084. 
7085. "I know it and shall prove it," said Rostov.
7086. 
7087. "I..."
7088. 
7089. Every muscle of Telyanin's pale, terrified face began to quiver, his
7090. eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising
7091. to Rostov's face, and his sobs were audible.
7092. 
7093. "Count!... Don't ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money,
7094. take it..." He threw it on the table. "I have an old father and
7095. mother!..."
7096. 
7097. Rostov took the money, avoiding Telyanin's eyes, and went out of the
7098. room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his
7099. steps. "O God," he said with tears in his eyes, "how could you do it?"
7100. 
7101. "Count..." said Telyanin drawing nearer to him.
7102. 
7103. "Don't touch me," said Rostov, drawing back. "If you need it, take the
7104. money," and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.
7105. 
7106. 
7107. 
7108. 
7109. 
7110. CHAPTER V
7111. 
7112. 
7113. That same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron's
7114. officers in Denisov's quarters.
7115. 
7116. "And I tell you, Rostov, that you must apologize to the colonel!" said
7117. a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and
7118. many wrinkles on his large features, to Rostov who was crimson with
7119. excitement.
7120. 
7121. The staff captain, Kirsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for
7122. affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.
7123. 
7124. "I will allow no one to call me a liar!" cried Rostov. "He told me I
7125. lied, and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me on
7126. duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me
7127. apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it
7128. beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then..."
7129. 
7130. "You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen," interrupted the
7131. staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache. "You
7132. tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has
7133. stolen..."
7134. 
7135. "I'm not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other
7136. officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am not
7137. a diplomatist. That's why I joined the hussars, thinking that here one
7138. would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying--so let him give
7139. me satisfaction..."
7140. 
7141. "That's all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that's not the point.
7142. Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand
7143. satisfaction of his regimental commander?"
7144. 
7145. Denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the
7146. conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered the
7147. staff captain's question by a disapproving shake of his head.
7148. 
7149. "You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other
7150. officers," continued the staff captain, "and Bogdanich" (the colonel was
7151. called Bogdanich) "shuts you up."
7152. 
7153. "He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth."
7154. 
7155. "Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must
7156. apologize."
7157. 
7158. "Not on any account!" exclaimed Rostov.
7159. 
7160. "I did not expect this of you," said the staff captain seriously and
7161. severely. "You don't wish to apologize, but, man, it's not only to him
7162. but to the whole regiment--all of us--you're to blame all round. The
7163. case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken
7164. advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the
7165. officers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and
7166. disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one
7167. scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don't see it like that. And
7168. Bogdanich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true.
7169. It's not pleasant, but what's to be done, my dear fellow? You landed
7170. yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some
7171. conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole
7172. affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not
7173. apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogdanich may be,
7174. anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! You're quick at taking
7175. offense, but you don't mind disgracing the whole regiment!" The staff
7176. captain's voice began to tremble. "You have been in the regiment next
7177. to no time, my lad, you're here today and tomorrow you'll be appointed
7178. adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said 'There are
7179. thieves among the Pavlograd officers!' But it's not all the same to us!
7180. Am I not right, Denisov? It's not the same!"
7181. 
7182. Denisov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with
7183. his glittering black eyes at Rostov.
7184. 
7185. "You value your own pride and don't wish to apologize," continued
7186. the staff captain, "but we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God
7187. willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the
7188. regiment, and Bogdanich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And
7189. all this is not right, it's not right! You may take offense or not but I
7190. always stick to mother truth. It's not right!"
7191. 
7192. And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostov.
7193. 
7194. "That's twue, devil take it!" shouted Denisov, jumping up. "Now then,
7195. Wostov, now then!"
7196. 
7197.  Rostov, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one
7198. officer and then at the other.
7199. 
7200. "No, gentlemen, no... you mustn't think... I quite understand. You're
7201. wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of the
7202. regiment I'd... Ah well, I'll show that in action, and for me the honor
7203. of the flag... Well, never mind, it's true I'm to blame, to blame all
7204. round. Well, what else do you want?..."
7205. 
7206. "Come, that's right, Count!" cried the staff captain, turning round and
7207. clapping Rostov on the shoulder with his big hand.
7208. 
7209. "I tell you," shouted Denisov, "he's a fine fellow."
7210. 
7211. "That's better, Count," said the staff captain, beginning to address
7212. Rostov by his title, as if in recognition of his confession. "Go and
7213. apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!"
7214. 
7215. "Gentlemen, I'll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me," said
7216. Rostov in an imploring voice, "but I can't apologize, by God I can't,
7217. do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking
7218. forgiveness?"
7219. 
7220. Denisov began to laugh.
7221. 
7222. "It'll be worse for you. Bogdanich is vindictive and you'll pay for your
7223. obstinacy," said Kirsten.
7224. 
7225. "No, on my word it's not obstinacy! I can't describe the feeling. I
7226. can't..."
7227. 
7228. "Well, it's as you like," said the staff captain. "And what has become
7229. of that scoundrel?" he asked Denisov.
7230. 
7231. "He has weported himself sick, he's to be stwuck off the list tomowwow,"
7232. muttered Denisov.
7233. 
7234. "It is an illness, there's no other way of explaining it," said the
7235. staff captain.
7236. 
7237. "Illness or not, he'd better not cwoss my path. I'd kill him!" shouted
7238. Denisov in a bloodthirsty tone.
7239. 
7240. Just then Zherkov entered the room.
7241. 
7242. "What brings you here?" cried the officers turning to the newcomer.
7243. 
7244. "We're to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his whole
7245. army."
7246. 
7247. "It's not true!"
7248. 
7249. "I've seen him myself!"
7250. 
7251. "What? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?"
7252. 
7253. "Into action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how did
7254. you come here?"
7255. 
7256. "I've been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil, Mack.
7257. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on Mack's
7258. arrival... What's the matter, Rostov? You look as if you'd just come out
7259. of a hot bath."
7260. 
7261. "Oh, my dear fellow, we're in such a stew here these last two days."
7262. 
7263. The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
7264. Zherkov. They were under orders to advance next day.
7265. 
7266. "We're going into action, gentlemen!"
7267. 
7268. "Well, thank God! We've been sitting here too long!"
7269. 
7270. 
7271. 
7272. 
7273. 
7274. CHAPTER VI
7275. 
7276. 
7277. Kutuzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over
7278. the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October 23 the
7279. Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the Russian
7280. baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling
7281. through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.
7282. 
7283. It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out
7284. before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the
7285. bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and
7286. then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could
7287. be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below,
7288. the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its
7289. cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling
7290. masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island,
7291. and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of
7292. the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the
7293. Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green
7294. treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a
7295. wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the
7296. enemy's horse patrols could be discerned.
7297. 
7298. Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of
7299. the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through
7300. his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvitski, who had been sent to the
7301. rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a gun
7302. carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and
7303. a flask, and Nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and real
7304. doppelkummel. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their
7305. knees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.
7306. 
7307. "Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It's a
7308. fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?" Nesvitski was
7309. saying.
7310. 
7311. "Thank you very much, Prince," answered one of the officers, pleased to
7312. be talking to a staff officer of such importance. "It's a lovely place!
7313. We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a splendid
7314. house!"
7315. 
7316. "Look, Prince," said another, who would have dearly liked to take
7317. another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the
7318. countryside--"See, our infantrymen have already got there. Look there
7319. in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something.
7320. They'll ransack that castle," he remarked with evident approval.
7321. 
7322. "So they will," said Nesvitski. "No, but what I should like," added he,
7323. munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, "would be to slip in
7324. over there."
7325. 
7326. He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and
7327. gleamed.
7328. 
7329. "That would be fine, gentlemen!"
7330. 
7331. The officers laughed.
7332. 
7333. "Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls among
7334. them. On my word I'd give five years of my life for it!"
7335. 
7336. "They must be feeling dull, too," said one of the bolder officers,
7337. laughing.
7338. 
7339. Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to
7340. the general, who looked through his field glass.
7341. 
7342. "Yes, so it is, so it is," said the general angrily, lowering the field
7343. glass and shrugging his shoulders, "so it is! They'll be fired on at the
7344. crossing. And why are they dawdling there?"
7345. 
7346. On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from
7347. their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant report of
7348. a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.
7349. 
7350. Nesvitski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.
7351. 
7352. "Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?" he said.
7353. 
7354. "It's a bad business," said the general without answering him, "our men
7355. have been wasting time."
7356. 
7357. "Hadn't I better ride over, your excellency?" asked Nesvitski.
7358. 
7359. "Yes, please do," answered the general, and he repeated the order that
7360. had already once been given in detail: "and tell the hussars that
7361. they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the
7362. inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected."
7363. 
7364. "Very good," answered Nesvitski.
7365. 
7366. He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack
7367. and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.
7368. 
7369. "I'll really call in on the nuns," he said to the officers who watched
7370. him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the hill.
7371. 
7372. "Now then, let's see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!" said the
7373. general, turning to an artillery officer. "Have a little fun to pass the
7374. time."
7375. 
7376. "Crew, to your guns!" commanded the officer.
7377. 
7378. In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began
7379. loading.
7380. 
7381. "One!" came the command.
7382. 
7383. Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening
7384. metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our
7385. troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke
7386. showing the spot where it burst.
7387. 
7388. The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got
7389. up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly
7390. visible as if but a stone's throw away, and the movements of the
7391. approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully
7392. out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot
7393. and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and
7394. spirited impression.
7395. 
7396. 
7397. 
7398. 
7399. 
7400. CHAPTER VII
7401. 
7402. 
7403. Two of the enemy's shots had already flown across the bridge, where
7404. there was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince Nesvitski, who had
7405. alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the
7406. railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few
7407. steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince
7408. Nesvitski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again and
7409. pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.
7410. 
7411. "What a fine fellow you are, friend!" said the Cossack to a convoy
7412. soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were
7413. crowded together close to his wheels and his horses. "What a fellow! You
7414. can't wait a moment! Don't you see the general wants to pass?"
7415. 
7416. But the convoyman took no notice of the word "general" and shouted at
7417. the soldiers who were blocking his way. "Hi there, boys! Keep to the
7418. left! Wait a bit." But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to
7419. shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense
7420. mass. Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvitski saw the rapid, noisy
7421. little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of
7422. the bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally
7423. uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos,
7424. knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with
7425. broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and
7426. feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the
7427. bridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of
7428. white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with
7429. a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along;
7430. sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot,
7431. an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry; and
7432. sometimes like a log floating down the river, an officers' or company's
7433. baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on all sides,
7434. moved across the bridge.
7435. 
7436. "It's as if a dam had burst," said the Cossack hopelessly. "Are there
7437. many more of you to come?"
7438. 
7439. "A million all but one!" replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat, with
7440. a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.
7441. 
7442. "If he" (he meant the enemy) "begins popping at the bridge now,"
7443. said the old soldier dismally to a comrade, "you'll forget to scratch
7444. yourself."
7445. 
7446. That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.
7447. 
7448. "Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?" said an orderly,
7449. running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.
7450. 
7451. And he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers who
7452. had evidently been drinking.
7453. 
7454. "And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end
7455. of his gun..." a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily,
7456. with a wide swing of his arm.
7457. 
7458. "Yes, the ham was just delicious..." answered another with a loud laugh.
7459. And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvitski did not learn who had been
7460. struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.
7461. 
7462. "Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they'll all
7463. be killed," a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.
7464. 
7465. "As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean," said a young soldier with
7466. an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, "I felt like dying
7467. of fright. I did, 'pon my word, I got that frightened!" said he, as if
7468. bragging of having been frightened.
7469. 
7470. That one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone
7471. before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and
7472. seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with
7473. a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman with an unweaned
7474. baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks
7475. were sitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were
7476. allowed to pass by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers
7477. turned toward the women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace
7478. all the soldiers' remarks related to the two young ones. Every face bore
7479. almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the women.
7480. 
7481. "Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!"
7482. 
7483. "Sell me the missis," said another soldier, addressing the German, who,
7484. angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast eyes.
7485. 
7486. "See how smart she's made herself! Oh, the devils!"
7487. 
7488. "There, Fedotov, you should be quartered on them!"
7489. 
7490. "I have seen as much before now, mate!"
7491. 
7492. "Where are you going?" asked an infantry officer who was eating an
7493. apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.
7494. 
7495. The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.
7496. 
7497. "Take it if you like," said the officer, giving the girl an apple.
7498. 
7499. The girl smiled and took it. Nesvitski like the rest of the men on the
7500. bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When
7501. they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same
7502. kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of
7503. a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole
7504. crowd had to wait.
7505. 
7506. "And why are they stopping? There's no proper order!" said the soldiers.
7507. "Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can't you wait? It'll
7508. be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here's an officer jammed in
7509. too"--different voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked at
7510. one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.
7511. 
7512. Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesvitski
7513. suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching...
7514. something big, that splashed into the water.
7515. 
7516. "Just see where it carries to!" a soldier near by said sternly, looking
7517. round at the sound.
7518. 
7519. "Encouraging us to get along quicker," said another uneasily.
7520. 
7521. The crowd moved on again. Nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball.
7522. 
7523. "Hey, Cossack, my horse!" he said. "Now, then, you there! get out of the
7524. way! Make way!"
7525. 
7526. With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting
7527. continually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way
7528. for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those
7529. nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still
7530. harder from behind.
7531. 
7532. "Nesvitski, Nesvitski! you numskull!" came a hoarse voice from behind
7533. him.
7534. 
7535. Nesvitski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated by
7536. the living mass of moving infantry, Vaska Denisov, red and shaggy, with
7537. his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over
7538. his shoulder.
7539. 
7540. "Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!" shouted Denisov
7541. evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot
7542. whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small
7543. bare hand as red as his face.
7544. 
7545. "Ah, Vaska!" joyfully replied Nesvitski. "What's up with you?"
7546. 
7547. "The squadwon can't pass," shouted Vaska Denisov, showing his white
7548. teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which twitched
7549. its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting white foam
7550. from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs, and
7551. apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him. "What
7552. is this? They're like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the way!... Let
7553. us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart! I'll hack you with my
7554. saber!" he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and
7555. flourishing it.
7556. 
7557. The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and
7558. Denisov joined Nesvitski.
7559. 
7560. "How's it you're not drunk today?" said Nesvitski when the other had
7561. ridden up to him.
7562. 
7563. "They don't even give one time to dwink!" answered Vaska Denisov. "They
7564. keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they mean to fight,
7565. let's fight. But the devil knows what this is."
7566. 
7567. "What a dandy you are today!" said Nesvitski, looking at Denisov's new
7568. cloak and saddlecloth.
7569. 
7570. Denisov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused
7571. a smell of perfume, and put it to Nesvitski's nose.
7572. 
7573. "Of course. I'm going into action! I've shaved, bwushed my teeth, and
7574. scented myself."
7575. 
7576. The imposing figure of Nesvitski followed by his Cossack, and
7577. the determination of Denisov who flourished his sword and shouted
7578. frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through
7579. to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the
7580. bridge Nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order,
7581. and having done this he rode back.
7582. 
7583. Having cleared the way Denisov stopped at the end of the bridge.
7584. Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
7585. ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw
7586. nearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,
7587. resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in
7588. front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge
7589. on his side of it.
7590. 
7591. The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the
7592. trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will,
7593. estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually
7594. encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in
7595. regular order.
7596. 
7597. "Smart lads! Only fit for a fair!" said one.
7598. 
7599. "What good are they? They're led about just for show!" remarked another.
7600. 
7601. "Don't kick up the dust, you infantry!" jested an hussar whose prancing
7602. horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.
7603. 
7604. "I'd like to put you on a two days' march with a knapsack! Your fine
7605. cords would soon get a bit rubbed," said an infantryman, wiping the mud
7606. off his face with his sleeve. "Perched up there, you're more like a bird
7607. than a man."
7608. 
7609. "There now, Zikin, they ought to put you on a horse. You'd look fine,"
7610. said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the
7611. weight of his knapsack.
7612. 
7613. "Take a stick between your legs, that'll suit you for a horse!" the
7614. hussar shouted back.
7615. 
7616. 
7617. 
7618. 
7619. 
7620. CHAPTER VIII
7621. 
7622. 
7623. The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing
7624. together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last
7625. the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last
7626. battalion came onto the bridge. Only Denisov's squadron of hussars
7627. remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could
7628. be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from
7629. the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the
7630. river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away.
7631. At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our
7632. Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the high
7633. ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These were the
7634. French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All
7635. the officers and men of Denisov's squadron, though they tried to talk of
7636. other things and to look in other directions, thought only of what
7637. was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches
7638. appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemy's troops. The
7639. weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly
7640. upon the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and at
7641. intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard
7642. from the hill. There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy
7643. except a few scattered skirmishers. An empty space of some seven hundred
7644. yards was all that separated them. The enemy ceased firing, and that
7645. stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates
7646. two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.
7647. 
7648. "One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing
7649. the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death. And
7650. what is there? Who is there?--there beyond that field, that tree, that
7651. roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know. You fear
7652. and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must
7653. be crossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will
7654. inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death. But you are
7655. strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such
7656. excitedly animated and healthy men." So thinks, or at any rate feels,
7657. anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives a
7658. particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that
7659. takes place at such moments.
7660. 
7661. On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose,
7662. and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The
7663. officers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The
7664. hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole
7665. squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron
7666. commander, awaiting the word of command. A second and a third cannon
7667. ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls
7668. with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell
7669. somewhere beyond them. The hussars did not look round, but at the sound
7670. of each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its
7671. rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the
7672. ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers
7673. without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their
7674. comrades' impression. Every face, from Denisov's to that of the bugler,
7675. showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and excitement,
7676. around chin and mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking at the
7677. soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Cadet Mironov ducked every
7678. time a ball flew past. Rostov on the left flank, mounted on his Rook--a
7679. handsome horse despite its game leg--had the happy air of a schoolboy
7680. called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels
7681. sure he will distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone with a
7682. clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat
7683. under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same indication of
7684. something new and stern showed round the mouth.
7685. 
7686. "Who's that curtseying there? Cadet Miwonov! That's not wight! Look at
7687. me," cried Denisov who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept turning
7688. his horse in front of the squadron.
7689. 
7690. The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Vaska Denisov, and his whole short
7691. sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which
7692. he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually did,
7693. especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he was
7694. only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when
7695. they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good
7696. horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle,
7697. he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse
7698. voice to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to Kirsten. The
7699. staff captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a walk to meet
7700. him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always, only his
7701. eyes were brighter than usual.
7702. 
7703. "Well, what about it?" said he to Denisov. "It won't come to a fight.
7704. You'll see--we shall retire."
7705. 
7706. "The devil only knows what they're about!" muttered Denisov. "Ah,
7707. Wostov," he cried noticing the cadet's bright face, "you've got it at
7708. last."
7709. 
7710. And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. Rostov felt
7711. perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge. Denisov
7712. galloped up to him.
7713. 
7714. "Your excellency! Let us attack them! I'll dwive them off."
7715. 
7716. "Attack indeed!" said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his
7717. face as if driving off a troublesome fly. "And why are you stopping
7718. here? Don't you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron
7719. back."
7720. 
7721. The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without
7722. having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front
7723. line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side
7724. of the river.
7725. 
7726. The two Pavlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the
7727. hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdanich Schubert, came
7728. up to Denisov's squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostov,
7729. without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the
7730. first time since their encounter concerning Telyanin. Rostov, feeling
7731. that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now
7732. admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the
7733. colonel's athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red
7734. neck. It seemed to Rostov that Bogdanich was only pretending not to
7735. notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet's courage,
7736. so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it seemed to
7737. him that Bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage. Next
7738. he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack
7739. just to punish him--Rostov. Then he imagined how, after the attack,
7740. Bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously
7741. extend the hand of reconciliation.
7742. 
7743. The high-shouldered figure of Zherkov, familiar to the Pavlograds as he
7744. had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel. After his
7745. dismissal from headquarters Zherkov had not remained in the regiment,
7746. saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could
7747. get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded in
7748. attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagration. He now came
7749. to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard.
7750. 
7751. "Colonel," he said, addressing Rostov's enemy with an air of gloomy
7752. gravity and glancing round at his comrades, "there is an order to stop
7753. and fire the bridge."
7754. 
7755. "An order to who?" asked the colonel morosely.
7756. 
7757. "I don't myself know 'to who,'" replied the cornet in a serious tone,
7758. "but the prince told me to 'go and tell the colonel that the hussars
7759. must return quickly and fire the bridge.'"
7760. 
7761. Zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
7762. colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout Nesvitski
7763. came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
7764. weight.
7765. 
7766. "How's this, Colonel?" he shouted as he approached. "I told you to fire
7767. the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all beside
7768. themselves over there and one can't make anything out."
7769. 
7770. The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvitski.
7771. 
7772. "You spoke to me of inflammable material," said he, "but you said
7773. nothing about firing it."
7774. 
7775. "But, my dear sir," said Nesvitski as he drew up, taking off his cap and
7776. smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand, "wasn't I
7777. telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material had been put
7778. in position?"
7779. 
7780. "I am not your 'dear sir,' Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell me to
7781. burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders strictly
7782. to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would it burn, I
7783. could not know by the holy spirit!"
7784. 
7785. "Ah, that's always the way!" said Nesvitski with a wave of the hand.
7786. "How did you get here?" said he, turning to Zherkov.
7787. 
7788. "On the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring you out!"
7789. 
7790. "You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer..." continued the colonel in an
7791. offended tone.
7792. 
7793. "Colonel," interrupted the officer of the suite, "You must be quick or
7794. the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot."
7795. 
7796. The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout
7797. staff officer, and at Zherkov, and he frowned.
7798. 
7799. "I will the bridge fire," he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
7800. that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
7801. do the right thing.
7802. 
7803. Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame
7804. for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second
7805. squadron, that in which Rostov was serving under Denisov, to return to
7806. the bridge.
7807. 
7808. "There, it's just as I thought," said Rostov to himself. "He wishes to
7809. test me!" His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. "Let
7810. him see whether I am a coward!" he thought.
7811. 
7812. Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression
7813. appeared that they had worn when under fire. Rostov watched his enemy,
7814. the colonel, closely--to find in his face confirmation of his own
7815. conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostov, and looked as
7816. he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word of
7817. command.
7818. 
7819. "Look sharp! Look sharp!" several voices repeated around him.
7820. 
7821. Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the
7822. hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men
7823. were crossing themselves. Rostov no longer looked at the colonel, he
7824. had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid
7825. that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into
7826. an orderly's charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a
7827. thud. Denisov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something. Rostov
7828. saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs catching
7829. and their sabers clattering.
7830. 
7831. "Stretchers!" shouted someone behind him.
7832. 
7833. Rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,
7834. trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not
7835. looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled,
7836. and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.
7837. 
7838. "At boss zides, Captain," he heard the voice of the colonel, who,
7839. having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a
7840. triumphant, cheerful face.
7841. 
7842. Rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and
7843. was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front the
7844. better. But Bogdanich, without looking at or recognizing Rostov, shouted
7845. to him:
7846. 
7847. "Who's that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come
7848. back, Cadet!" he cried angrily; and turning to Denisov, who, showing off
7849. his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:
7850. 
7851. "Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount," he said.
7852. 
7853. "Oh, every bullet has its billet," answered Vaska Denisov, turning in
7854. his saddle.
7855. 
7856. 
7857. Meanwhile Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer of the suite were standing
7858. together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small group of
7859. men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord, and blue
7860. riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at what was
7861. approaching in the distance from the opposite side--the blue uniforms
7862. and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.
7863. 
7864. "Will they burn the bridge or not? Who'll get there first? Will they get
7865. there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range
7866. and wipe them out?" These were the questions each man of the troops
7867. on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a
7868. sinking heart--watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening
7869. light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their
7870. bayonets and guns.
7871. 
7872. "Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!" said Nesvitski; "they are within
7873. grapeshot range now."
7874. 
7875. "He shouldn't have taken so many men," said the officer of the suite.
7876. 
7877. "True enough," answered Nesvitski; "two smart fellows could have done
7878. the job just as well."
7879. 
7880. "Ah, your excellency," put in Zherkov, his eyes fixed on the hussars,
7881. but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether he
7882. was speaking in jest or in earnest. "Ah, your excellency! How you look
7883. at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the Vladimir medal
7884. and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the squadron may be
7885. recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our Bogdanich knows how
7886. things are done."
7887. 
7888. "There now!" said the officer of the suite, "that's grapeshot."
7889. 
7890. He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached
7891. and hurriedly removed.
7892. 
7893. On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke
7894. appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the
7895. moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two
7896. reports one after another, and a third.
7897. 
7898. "Oh! Oh!" groaned Nesvitski as if in fierce pain, seizing the officer of
7899. the suite by the arm. "Look! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen!"
7900. 
7901. "Two, I think."
7902. 
7903. "If I were Tsar I would never go to war," said Nesvitski, turning away.
7904. 
7905. The French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue
7906. uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again
7907. but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the
7908. bridge. But this time Nesvitski could not see what was happening there,
7909. as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in
7910. setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no
7911. longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was
7912. someone to fire at.
7913. 
7914. The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars
7915. got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too
7916. high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and
7917. knocked three of them over.
7918. 
7919. Rostov, absorbed by his relations with Bogdanich, had paused on the
7920. bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he
7921. had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the
7922. bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the
7923. other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a
7924. rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest
7925. to him fell against the rails with a groan. Rostov ran up to him with
7926. the others. Again someone shouted, "Stretchers!" Four men seized the
7927. hussar and began lifting him.
7928. 
7929. "Oooh! For Christ's sake let me alone!" cried the wounded man, but still
7930. he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.
7931. 
7932. Nicholas Rostov turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed
7933. into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the
7934. sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep!
7935. How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter the
7936. waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer still were the faraway
7937. blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and
7938. the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace
7939. and happiness... "I should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I
7940. were there," thought Rostov. "In myself alone and in that sunshine there
7941. is so much happiness; but here... groans, suffering, fear, and this
7942. uncertainty and hurry... There--they are shouting again, and again are
7943. all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death, is
7944. here above me and around... Another instant and I shall never again see
7945. the sun, this water, that gorge!..."
7946. 
7947. At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other
7948. stretchers came into view before Rostov. And the fear of death and of
7949. the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one
7950. feeling of sickening agitation.
7951. 
7952. "O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect
7953. me!" Rostov whispered.
7954. 
7955. The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices
7956. sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.
7957. 
7958. "Well, fwiend? So you've smelt powdah!" shouted Vaska Denisov just above
7959. his ear.
7960. 
7961. "It's all over; but I am a coward--yes, a coward!" thought Rostov, and
7962. sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one foot,
7963. from the orderly and began to mount.
7964. 
7965. "Was that grapeshot?" he asked Denisov.
7966. 
7967. "Yes and no mistake!" cried Denisov. "You worked like wegular bwicks and
7968. it's nasty work! An attack's pleasant work! Hacking away at the dogs!
7969. But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them shooting at you like
7970. a target."
7971. 
7972. And Denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostov, composed of
7973. the colonel, Nesvitski, Zherkov, and the officer from the suite.
7974. 
7975. "Well, it seems that no one has noticed," thought Rostov. And this was
7976. true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation which
7977. the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.
7978. 
7979. "Here's something for you to report," said Zherkov. "See if I don't get
7980. promoted to a sublieutenancy."
7981. 
7982. "Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!" said the colonel
7983. triumphantly and gaily.
7984. 
7985. "And if he asks about the losses?"
7986. 
7987. "A trifle," said the colonel in his bass voice: "two hussars wounded,
7988. and one knocked out," he added, unable to restrain a happy smile, and
7989. pronouncing the phrase "knocked out" with ringing distinctness.
7990. 
7991. 
7992. 
7993. 
7994. 
7995. CHAPTER IX
7996. 
7997. 
7998. Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command
7999. of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it,
8000. losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies,
8001. and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had
8002. been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded
8003. by Kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where
8004. overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as
8005. necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment.
8006. There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the
8007. courage and endurance--acknowledged even by the enemy--with which the
8008. Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more
8009. rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and
8010. had joined Kutuzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army,
8011. and Kutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces.
8012. The defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an
8013. offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the
8014. modern science of strategics, had been handed to Kutuzov when he was in
8015. Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable
8016. aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were
8017. advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.
8018. 
8019. On the twenty-eighth of October Kutuzov with his army crossed to the
8020. left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time
8021. with the river between himself and the main body of the French. On the
8022. thirtieth he attacked Mortier's division, which was on the left bank,
8023. and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were taken:
8024. banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a
8025. fortnight's retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had
8026. not only held the field but had repulsed the French. Though the troops
8027. were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number in
8028. killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and
8029. wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter
8030. in which Kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and
8031. though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military
8032. hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the
8033. stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of
8034. the army considerably. Throughout the whole army and at headquarters
8035. most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach
8036. of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of
8037. the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.
8038. 
8039. Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian
8040. General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse had been
8041. wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark
8042. of the commander in chief's special favor he was sent with the news of
8043. this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was
8044. threatened by the French) but at Brunn. Despite his apparently delicate
8045. build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many
8046. very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at
8047. Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokhturov to Kutuzov,
8048. he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brunn. To be so sent
8049. meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion.
8050. 
8051. The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that
8052. had fallen the previous day--the day of the battle. Reviewing his
8053. impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the
8054. impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off
8055. given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince
8056. Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a
8057. man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon
8058. as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the
8059. wheels and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that
8060. the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he
8061. quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that
8062. this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away. He
8063. again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage
8064. during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark
8065. starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was
8066. thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides
8067. of the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.
8068. 
8069. At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded.
8070. The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front
8071. cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each of
8072. the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being
8073. jolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking (he heard Russian
8074. words), others were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked
8075. silently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy
8076. hurrying past them.
8077. 
8078. Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what
8079. action they had been wounded. "Day before yesterday, on the Danube,"
8080. answered the soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the
8081. soldier three gold pieces.
8082. 
8083. "That's for them all," he said to the officer who came up.
8084. 
8085. "Get well soon, lads!" he continued, turning to the soldiers. "There's
8086. plenty to do still."
8087. 
8088. "What news, sir?" asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a
8089. conversation.
8090. 
8091. "Good news!... Go on!" he shouted to the driver, and they galloped on.
8092. 
8093. It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved
8094. streets of Brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the
8095. lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that
8096. atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a
8097. soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night,
8098. Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and
8099. alert than he had done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly
8100. and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and
8101. rapidity. He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, no longer
8102. dim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself
8103. stating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual
8104. questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give. He
8105. expected to be at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance
8106. to the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and
8107. learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.
8108. 
8109. "To the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will find
8110. the adjutant on duty," said the official. "He will conduct you to the
8111. Minister of War."
8112. 
8113. The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went
8114. in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and bowing
8115. with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a
8116. corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The
8117. adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
8118. attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.
8119. 
8120. Prince Andrew's joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
8121. approached the door of the minister's room. He felt offended, and
8122. without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
8123. one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly
8124. suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the
8125. adjutant and the minister. "Away from the smell of powder, they
8126. probably think it easy to gain victories!" he thought. His eyes narrowed
8127. disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with peculiarly
8128. deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the
8129. minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil
8130. notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice
8131. of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the minister's bent
8132. bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading to the end, without
8133. raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps.
8134. 
8135. "Take this and deliver it," said he to his adjutant, handing him the
8136. papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.
8137. 
8138. Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutuzov's army interested
8139. the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was
8140. concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that
8141. impression. "But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me," he
8142. thought. The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them
8143. evenly, and then raised his head. He had an intellectual and distinctive
8144. head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent
8145. expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and
8146. habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which
8147. does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is
8148. continually receiving many petitioners one after another.
8149. 
8150. "From General Field Marshal Kutuzov?" he asked. "I hope it is good news?
8151. There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was high time!"
8152. 
8153. He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it
8154. with a mournful expression.
8155. 
8156. "Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!" he exclaimed in German. "What a calamity!
8157. What a calamity!"
8158. 
8159. Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked
8160. at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.
8161. 
8162. "Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is
8163. not captured." Again he pondered. "I am very glad you have brought good
8164. news, though Schmidt's death is a heavy price to pay for the victory.
8165. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I thank
8166. you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade.
8167. However, I will let you know."
8168. 
8169. The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,
8170. reappeared.
8171. 
8172. "Au revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to see
8173. you," he added, bowing his head.
8174. 
8175. When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest
8176. and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
8177. indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The
8178. whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed
8179. the memory of a remote event long past.
8180. 
8181. 
8182. 
8183. 
8184. 
8185. CHAPTER X
8186. 
8187. 
8188. Prince Andrew stayed at Brunn with Bilibin, a Russian acquaintance of
8189. his in the diplomatic service.
8190. 
8191. "Ah, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor," said
8192. Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. "Franz, put the prince's
8193. things in my bedroom," said he to the servant who was ushering Bolkonski
8194. in. "So you're a messenger of victory, eh? Splendid! And I am sitting
8195. here ill, as you see."
8196. 
8197. After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat's
8198. luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bilibin
8199. settled down comfortably beside the fire.
8200. 
8201. After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of
8202. all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince
8203. Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such
8204. as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant,
8205. after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian
8206. (for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he
8207. supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was
8208. then particularly strong.
8209. 
8210. Bilibin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as
8211. Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but
8212. had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutuzov.
8213. Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high
8214. in the military profession, so to an even greater extent Bilibin gave
8215. promise of rising in his diplomatic career. He still a young man but
8216. no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age
8217. of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather
8218. important post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador
8219. in Vienna knew him and valued him. He was not one of those many
8220. diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities,
8221. avoid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one of those,
8222. who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would
8223. sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked well
8224. whatever the import of his work. It was not the question "What for?"
8225. but the question "How?" that interested him. What the diplomatic matter
8226. might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a
8227. circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and elegantly.
8228. Bilibin's services were valued not only for what he wrote, but also for
8229. his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres.
8230. 
8231. Bilibin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be made
8232. elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say
8233. something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was
8234. possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,
8235. finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the
8236. inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so
8237. that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to
8238. drawing room. And, in fact, Bilibin's witticisms were hawked about
8239. in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters
8240. considered important.
8241. 
8242. His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which always
8243. looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one's fingers after a
8244. Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play
8245. of expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds
8246. and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and
8247. deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always
8248. twinkled and looked out straight.
8249. 
8250. "Well, now tell me about your exploits," said he.
8251. 
8252. Bolkonski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described the
8253. engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.
8254. 
8255. "They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
8256. skittles," said he in conclusion.
8257. 
8258. Bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.
8259. 
8260. "Cependant, mon cher," he remarked, examining his nails from a distance
8261. and puckering the skin above his left eye, "malgre la haute estime que
8262. je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, j'avoue que votre victoire
8263. n'est pas des plus victorieuses." *
8264. 
8265. 
8266.      * "But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox
8267.      Russian army, I must say that your victory was not
8268.      particularly victorious."
8269. 
8270. 
8271. He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in
8272. Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.
8273. 
8274. "Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier
8275. and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers!
8276. Where's the victory?"
8277. 
8278. "But seriously," said Prince Andrew, "we can at any rate say without
8279. boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm..."
8280. 
8281. "Why didn't you capture one, just one, marshal for us?"
8282. 
8283. "Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of
8284. a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by seven
8285. in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon."
8286. 
8287. "And why didn't you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have
8288. been there at seven in the morning," returned Bilibin with a smile. "You
8289. ought to have been there at seven in the morning."
8290. 
8291. "Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic
8292. methods that he had better leave Genoa alone?" retorted Prince Andrew in
8293. the same tone.
8294. 
8295. "I know," interrupted Bilibin, "you're thinking it's very easy to take
8296. marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but still why
8297. didn't you capture him? So don't be surprised if not only the Minister
8298. of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and King Francis
8299. is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor secretary of the
8300. Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my
8301. Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the Prater... True,
8302. we have no Prater here..."
8303. 
8304. He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
8305. forehead.
8306. 
8307. "It is now my turn to ask you 'why?' mon cher," said Bolkonski. "I
8308. confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties
8309. here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I can't make it out. Mack loses
8310. a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs
8311. of life and make blunder after blunder. Kutuzov alone at last gains a
8312. real victory, destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French,
8313. and the Minister of War does not even care to hear the details."
8314. 
8315. "That's just it, my dear fellow. You see it's hurrah for the Tsar, for
8316. Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what
8317. do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring us nice
8318. news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke's as
8319. good as another, as you know) and even if it is only over a fire brigade
8320. of Bonaparte's, that will be another story and we'll fire off some
8321. cannon! But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us. The
8322. Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself.
8323. You abandon Vienna, give up its defense--as much as to say: 'Heaven is
8324. with us, but heaven help you and your capital!' The one general whom we
8325. all loved, Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate
8326. us on the victory! Admit that more irritating news than yours could not
8327. have been conceived. It's as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose.
8328. Besides, suppose you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke
8329. Karl gained a victory, what effect would that have on the general course
8330. of events? It's too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French
8331. army!"
8332. 
8333. "What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?"
8334. 
8335. "Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schonbrunn, and the count, our
8336. dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders."
8337. 
8338. After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and
8339. especially after having dined, Bolkonski felt that he could not take in
8340. the full significance of the words he heard.
8341. 
8342. "Count Lichtenfels was here this morning," Bilibin continued, "and
8343. showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was fully
8344. described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that your
8345. victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can't be
8346. received as a savior."
8347. 
8348. "Really I don't care about that, I don't care at all," said Prince
8349. Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems
8350. was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of
8351. Austria's capital. "How is it Vienna was taken? What of the bridge and
8352. its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard reports that
8353. Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?" he said.
8354. 
8355. "Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is defending
8356. us--doing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending us. But
8357. Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been taken and I
8358. hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been given to
8359. blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of
8360. Bohemia, and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour
8361. between two fires."
8362. 
8363. "But still this does not mean that the campaign is over," said Prince
8364. Andrew.
8365. 
8366. "Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they daren't
8367. say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign, it won't
8368. be your skirmishing at Durrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that will
8369. decide the matter, but those who devised it," said Bilibin quoting one
8370. of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and pausing.
8371. "The only question is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor
8372. Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia joins the
8373. Allies, Austria's hand will be forced and there will be war. If not
8374. it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new
8375. Campo Formio are to be drawn up."
8376. 
8377. "What an extraordinary genius!" Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,
8378. clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, "and what luck
8379. the man has!"
8380. 
8381. "Buonaparte?" said Bilibin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead to
8382. indicate that he was about to say something witty. "Buonaparte?" he
8383. repeated, accentuating the u: "I think, however, now that he lays down
8384. laws for Austria at Schonbrunn, il faut lui faire grace de l'u! * I
8385. shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!"
8386. 
8387. 
8388.     * "We must let him off the u!"
8389. 
8390. 
8391. "But joking apart," said Prince Andrew, "do you really think the
8392. campaign is over?"
8393. 
8394. "This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is not
8395. used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the first
8396. place because her provinces have been pillaged--they say the Holy
8397. Russian army loots terribly--her army is destroyed, her capital
8398. taken, and all this for the beaux yeux * of His Sardinian Majesty. And
8399. therefore--this is between ourselves--I instinctively feel that we are
8400. being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and
8401. projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately."
8402. 
8403. 
8404.     * Fine eyes.
8405. 
8406. 
8407. "Impossible!" cried Prince Andrew. "That would be too base."
8408. 
8409. "If we live we shall see," replied Bilibin, his face again becoming
8410. smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end.
8411. 
8412. When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a
8413. clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he
8414. felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far away
8415. from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria's treachery, Bonaparte's
8416. new triumph, tomorrow's levee and parade, and the audience with the
8417. Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.
8418. 
8419. He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry
8420. and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now
8421. again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill,
8422. the French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode
8423. forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around,
8424. and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since
8425. childhood.
8426. 
8427. He woke up...
8428. 
8429. "Yes, that all happened!" he said, and, smiling happily to himself like
8430. a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.
8431. 
8432. 
8433. 
8434. 
8435. 
8436. CHAPTER XI
8437. 
8438. 
8439. Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first
8440. thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented
8441. to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite
8442. Austrian adjutant, Bilibin, and last night's conversation. Having
8443. dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had
8444. not worn for a long time, he went into Bilibin's study fresh, animated,
8445. and handsome, with his hand bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen
8446. of the diplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte Kuragin, who was a
8447. secretary to the embassy, Bolkonski was already acquainted. Bilibin
8448. introduced him to the others.
8449. 
8450. The gentlemen assembled at Bilibin's were young, wealthy, gay society
8451. men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which Bilibin, their
8452. leader, called les notres. * This set, consisting almost exclusively of
8453. diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with
8454. war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to
8455. the official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince
8456. Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From
8457. politeness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions
8458. about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry
8459. jests and gossip.
8460. 
8461. 
8462.     * Ours.
8463. 
8464. 
8465. "But the best of it was," said one, telling of the misfortune of
8466. a fellow diplomat, "that the Chancellor told him flatly that his
8467. appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it.
8468. Can you fancy the figure he cut?..."
8469. 
8470. "But the worst of it, gentlemen--I am giving Kuragin away to you--is
8471. that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking
8472. advantage of it!"
8473. 
8474. Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its
8475. arm. He began to laugh.
8476. 
8477. "Tell me about that!" he said.
8478. 
8479. "Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!" cried several voices.
8480. 
8481. "You, Bolkonski, don't know," said Bilibin turning to Prince Andrew,
8482. "that all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the
8483. Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among
8484. the women!"
8485. 
8486. "La femme est la compagne de l'homme," * announced Prince Hippolyte, and
8487. began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.
8488. 
8489. 
8490.     * "Woman is man's companion."
8491. 
8492. 
8493. Bilibin and the rest of "ours" burst out laughing in Hippolyte's face,
8494. and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom--he had to admit--he had
8495. almost been jealous on his wife's account, was the butt of this set.
8496. 
8497. "Oh, I must give you a treat," Bilibin whispered to Bolkonski. "Kuragin
8498. is exquisite when he discusses politics--you should see his gravity!"
8499. 
8500. He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking
8501. to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these
8502. two.
8503. 
8504. "The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance," began
8505. Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, "without
8506. expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless
8507. His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...
8508. 
8509. "Wait, I have not finished..." he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him
8510. by the arm, "I believe that intervention will be stronger than
8511. nonintervention. And..." he paused. "Finally one cannot impute the
8512. nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end." And
8513. he released Bolkonski's arm to indicate that he had now quite finished.
8514. 
8515. "Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden
8516. mouth!" said Bilibin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with
8517. satisfaction.
8518. 
8519. Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently
8520. distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild
8521. laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.
8522. 
8523. "Well now, gentlemen," said Bilibin, "Bolkonski is my guest in this
8524. house and in Brunn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I can, with
8525. all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would be easy,
8526. but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult, and I
8527. beg you all to help me. Brunn's attractions must be shown him. You can
8528. undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course the
8529. women."
8530. 
8531. "We must let him see Amelie, she's exquisite!" said one of "ours,"
8532. kissing his finger tips.
8533. 
8534. "In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane
8535. interests," said Bilibin.
8536. 
8537. "I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality,
8538. gentlemen, it is already time for me to go," replied Prince Andrew
8539. looking at his watch.
8540. 
8541. "Where to?"
8542. 
8543. "To the Emperor."
8544. 
8545. "Oh! Oh! Oh! Well, au revoir, Bolkonski! Au revoir, Prince! Come back
8546. early to dinner," cried several voices. "We'll take you in hand."
8547. 
8548. "When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way
8549. that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated," said Bilibin,
8550. accompanying him to the hall.
8551. 
8552. "I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts, I
8553. can't," replied Bolkonski, smiling.
8554. 
8555. "Well, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving
8556. audiences, but he does not like talking himself and can't do it, as you
8557. will see."
8558. 
8559. 
8560. 
8561. 
8562. 
8563. CHAPTER XII
8564. 
8565. 
8566. At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had
8567. been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his
8568. face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was
8569. over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed
8570. Bolkonski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor
8571. Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the
8572. conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor
8573. seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.
8574. 
8575. "Tell me, when did the battle begin?" he asked hurriedly.
8576. 
8577. Prince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple:
8578. "Was Kutuzov well? When had he left Krems?" and so on. The Emperor spoke
8579. as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions--the answers
8580. to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest him.
8581. 
8582. "At what o'clock did the battle begin?" asked the Emperor.
8583. 
8584. "I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o'clock the battle began at the
8585. front, but at Durrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five in
8586. the afternoon," replied Bolkonski growing more animated and expecting
8587. that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which he had
8588. ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor smiled
8589. and interrupted him.
8590. 
8591. "How many miles?"
8592. 
8593. "From where to where, Your Majesty?"
8594. 
8595. "From Durrenstein to Krems."
8596. 
8597. "Three and a half miles, Your Majesty."
8598. 
8599. "The French have abandoned the left bank?"
8600. 
8601. "According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the
8602. night."
8603. 
8604. "Is there sufficient forage in Krems?"
8605. 
8606. "Forage has not been supplied to the extent..."
8607. 
8608. The Emperor interrupted him.
8609. 
8610. "At what o'clock was General Schmidt killed?"
8611. 
8612. "At seven o'clock, I believe."
8613. 
8614. "At seven o'clock? It's very sad, very sad!"
8615. 
8616. The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and
8617. was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he saw
8618. friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday's adjutant reproached
8619. him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him his own house.
8620. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa
8621. Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring on him. The
8622. Empress' chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The archduchess
8623. also wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and for a few
8624. seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador took him by
8625. the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to him.
8626. 
8627. Contrary to Bilibin's forecast the news he had brought was joyfully
8628. received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutuzov was awarded
8629. the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards.
8630. Bolkonski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning
8631. calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five in
8632. the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to Bilibin's
8633. house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit
8634. to Brunn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage. Franz,
8635. Bilibin's man, was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of
8636. the front door.
8637. 
8638. Before returning to Bilibin's Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to
8639. provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some
8640. time in the shop.
8641. 
8642. "What is it?" he asked.
8643. 
8644. "Oh, your excellency!" said Franz, with difficulty rolling the
8645. portmanteau into the vehicle, "we are to move on still farther. The
8646. scoundrel is again at our heels!"
8647. 
8648. "Eh? What?" asked Prince Andrew.
8649. 
8650. Bilibin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.
8651. 
8652. "There now! Confess that this is delightful," said he. "This affair of
8653. the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without striking a
8654. blow!"
8655. 
8656. Prince Andrew could not understand.
8657. 
8658. "But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town
8659. knows?"
8660. 
8661. "I come from the archduchess'. I heard nothing there."
8662. 
8663. "And you didn't see that everybody is packing up?"
8664. 
8665. "I did not... What is it all about?" inquired Prince Andrew impatiently.
8666. 
8667. "What's it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that
8668. Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat is
8669. now rushing along the road to Brunn and will be here in a day or two."
8670. 
8671. "What? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?"
8672. 
8673. "That is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why."
8674. 
8675. Bolkonski shrugged his shoulders.
8676. 
8677. "But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It
8678. will be cut off," said he.
8679. 
8680. "That's just it," answered Bilibin. "Listen! The French entered
8681. Vienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those
8682. gentlemen, messieurs les marechaux, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard,
8683. mount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.)
8684. 'Gentlemen,' says one of them, 'you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and
8685. doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and
8686. an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge
8687. and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the Emperor
8688. Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take it!' 'Yes,
8689. let's!' say the others. And off they go and take the bridge, cross it,
8690. and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube, marching
8691. on us, you, and your lines of communication."
8692. 
8693. 
8694.     * The marshalls.
8695. 
8696. 
8697. "Stop jesting," said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news
8698. grieved him and yet he was pleased.
8699. 
8700. As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless
8701. situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it
8702. out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from
8703. the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame!
8704. Listening to Bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army
8705. he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one
8706. that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the
8707. executing of the plan.
8708. 
8709. "Stop this jesting," he said
8710. 
8711. "I am not jesting," Bilibin went on. "Nothing is truer or sadder. These
8712. gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they
8713. assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to
8714. negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the tete-de-pont. *
8715. They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that
8716. the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they
8717. desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for
8718. Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the
8719. cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved,
8720. flings the bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches
8721. the tete-de-pont. At length appears the lieutenant general, our dear
8722. Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself. 'Dearest foe! Flower of the
8723. Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars Hostilities are ended, we can
8724. shake one another's hand.... The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience
8725. to make Prince Auersperg's acquaintance.' In a word, those gentlemen,
8726. Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so
8727. flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals,
8728. and so dazzled by the sight of Murat's mantle and ostrich plumes,
8729. qu'il n'y voit que du feu, et oublie celui qu'il devait faire faire sur
8730. l'ennemi!" *(2) In spite of the animation of his speech, Bilibin did not
8731. forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation.
8732. "The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the
8733. bridge is taken! But what is best of all," he went on, his excitement
8734. subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, "is that the
8735. sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire
8736. the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French
8737. troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes
8738. stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general,
8739. goes up to Auersperg and says: 'Prince, you are being deceived, here are
8740. the French!' Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed
8741. to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a
8742. true Gascon) and says: 'I don't recognize the world-famous Austrian
8743. discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!' It
8744. was a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and
8745. orders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair
8746. of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor
8747. rascality...."
8748. 
8749. 
8750.      * Bridgehead.
8751. 
8752.      * (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that
8753.      he ought to be firing at the enemy.
8754. 
8755. 
8756. "It may be treachery," said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the gray
8757. overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the
8758. glory that awaited him.
8759. 
8760. "Not that either. That puts the court in too bad a light," replied
8761. Bilibin. "It's not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is just
8762. as at Ulm... it is..."--he seemed to be trying to find the right
8763. expression. "C'est... c'est du Mack. Nous sommes mackes (It is... it
8764. is a bit of Mack. We are Macked)," he concluded, feeling that he
8765. had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His
8766. hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a
8767. slight smile he began to examine his nails.
8768. 
8769. "Where are you off to?" he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had risen
8770. and was going toward his room.
8771. 
8772. "I am going away."
8773. 
8774. "Where to?"
8775. 
8776. "To the army."
8777. 
8778. "But you meant to stay another two days?"
8779. 
8780. "But now I am off at once."
8781. 
8782. And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to
8783. his room.
8784. 
8785. "Do you know, mon cher," said Bilibin following him, "I have been
8786. thinking about you. Why are you going?"
8787. 
8788. And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles
8789. vanished from his face.
8790. 
8791. Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.
8792. 
8793. "Why are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to
8794. the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher, it is
8795. heroism!"
8796. 
8797. "Not at all," said Prince Andrew.
8798. 
8799. "But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other
8800. side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary,
8801. is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for
8802. anything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been
8803. dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our
8804. ill luck takes us. They say we are going to Olmutz, and Olmutz is a very
8805. decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my caleche."
8806. 
8807. "Do stop joking, Bilibin," cried Bolkonski.
8808. 
8809. "I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are you
8810. going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two things,"
8811. and the skin over his left temple puckered, "either you will not reach
8812. your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will share defeat and
8813. disgrace with Kutuzov's whole army."
8814. 
8815. And Bilibin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was
8816. insoluble.
8817. 
8818. "I cannot argue about it," replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he thought:
8819. "I am going to save the army."
8820. 
8821. "My dear fellow, you are a hero!" said Bilibin.
8822. 
8823. 
8824. 
8825. 
8826. 
8827. CHAPTER XIII
8828. 
8829. 
8830. That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, Bolkonski
8831. set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and
8832. fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.
8833. 
8834. In Brunn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy
8835. baggage was already being dispatched to Olmutz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince
8836. Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with
8837. great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed
8838. with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew
8839. took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and
8840. weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the
8841. commander in chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the
8842. position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of
8843. the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.
8844. 
8845. "Cette armee russe que l'or de l'Angleterre a transportee des extremites
8846. de l'univers, nous allons lui faire eprouver le meme sort--(le sort de
8847. l'armee d'Ulm)." * He remembered these words in Bonaparte's address
8848. to his army at the beginning of the campaign, and they awoke in him
8849. astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling of wounded pride,
8850. and a hope of glory. "And should there be nothing left but to die?" he
8851. thought. "Well, if need be, I shall do it no worse than others."
8852. 
8853. 
8854.      * "That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of
8855.      the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same
8856.      fate--(the fate of the army at Ulm)."
8857. 
8858. 
8859. He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments,
8860. carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all
8861. kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and
8862. sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear
8863. could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts
8864. and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the
8865. urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers.
8866. All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some
8867. flayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers
8868. sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their
8869. companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or
8870. returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At
8871. each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the
8872. din of shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud
8873. pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped,
8874. traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers
8875. directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their
8876. voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces
8877. that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.
8878. 
8879. "Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army," thought Bolkonski, recalling
8880. Bilibin's words.
8881. 
8882. Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to
8883. a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle,
8884. evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and
8885. looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a caleche. A
8886. soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the
8887. apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up
8888. and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention
8889. was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An
8890. officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving
8891. the woman's vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes
8892. of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed
8893. piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron
8894. and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:
8895. 
8896. "Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven's sake... Protect
8897. me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh
8898. Chasseurs.... They won't let us pass, we are left behind and have lost
8899. our people..."
8900. 
8901. "I'll flatten you into a pancake!" shouted the angry officer to the
8902. soldier. "Turn back with your slut!"
8903. 
8904. "Mr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?" screamed the
8905. doctor's wife.
8906. 
8907. "Kindly let this cart pass. Don't you see it's a woman?" said Prince
8908. Andrew riding up to the officer.
8909. 
8910. The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the
8911. soldier. "I'll teach you to push on!... Back!"
8912. 
8913. "Let them pass, I tell you!" repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his
8914. lips.
8915. 
8916. "And who are you?" cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy rage,
8917. "who are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here, not
8918. you! Go back or I'll flatten you into a pancake," repeated he. This
8919. expression evidently pleased him.
8920. 
8921. "That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp," came a voice from
8922. behind.
8923. 
8924. Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless,
8925. tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his
8926. championship of the doctor's wife in her queer trap might expose him to
8927. what he dreaded more than anything in the world--to ridicule; but his
8928. instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence Prince
8929. Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his
8930. riding whip.
8931. 
8932. "Kind...ly let--them--pass!"
8933. 
8934. The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.
8935. 
8936. "It's all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there's this
8937. disorder," he muttered. "Do as you like."
8938. 
8939. Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the
8940. doctor's wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with
8941. a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he
8942. galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief
8943. was.
8944. 
8945. On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house,
8946. intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort
8947. out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. "This
8948. is a mob of scoundrels and not an army," he was thinking as he went up
8949. to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by
8950. name.
8951. 
8952. He turned round. Nesvitski's handsome face looked out of the little
8953. window. Nesvitski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and
8954. flourishing his arm, called him to enter.
8955. 
8956. "Bolkonski! Bolkonski!... Don't you hear? Eh? Come quick..." he shouted.
8957. 
8958. Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvitski and another adjutant
8959. having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he
8960. had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm. This
8961. was particularly noticeable on Nesvitski's usually laughing countenance.
8962. 
8963. "Where is the commander in chief?" asked Bolkonski.
8964. 
8965. "Here, in that house," answered the adjutant.
8966. 
8967. "Well, is it true that it's peace and capitulation?" asked Nesvitski.
8968. 
8969. "I was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could
8970. do to get here."
8971. 
8972. "And we, my dear boy! It's terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,
8973. we're getting it still worse," said Nesvitski. "But sit down and have
8974. something to eat."
8975. 
8976. "You won't be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,
8977. Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is," said the other
8978. adjutant.
8979. 
8980. "Where are headquarters?"
8981. 
8982. "We are to spend the night in Znaim."
8983. 
8984. "Well, I have got all I need into packs for two horses," said Nesvitski.
8985. "They've made up splendid packs for me--fit to cross the Bohemian
8986. mountains with. It's a bad lookout, old fellow! But what's the matter
8987. with you? You must be ill to shiver like that," he added, noticing that
8988. Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.
8989. 
8990. "It's nothing," replied Prince Andrew.
8991. 
8992. He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor's wife and
8993. the convoy officer.
8994. 
8995. "What is the commander in chief doing here?" he asked.
8996. 
8997. "I can't make out at all," said Nesvitski.
8998. 
8999. "Well, all I can make out is that everything is abominable, abominable,
9000. quite abominable!" said Prince Andrew, and he went off to the house
9001. where the commander in chief was.
9002. 
9003. Passing by Kutuzov's carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his
9004. suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince
9005. Andrew entered the passage. Kutuzov himself, he was told, was in the
9006. house with Prince Bagration and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian
9007. general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozlovski was
9008. squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned
9009. up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozlovski's face
9010. looked worn--he too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced at
9011. Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.
9012. 
9013. "Second line... have you written it?" he continued dictating to the
9014. clerk. "The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian..."
9015. 
9016. "One can't write so fast, your honor," said the clerk, glancing angrily
9017. and disrespectfully at Kozlovski.
9018. 
9019. Through the door came the sounds of Kutuzov's voice, excited and
9020. dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the
9021. sound of these voices, the inattentive way Kozlovski looked at him, the
9022. disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and
9023. Kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander
9024. in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the
9025. horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and
9026. disastrous was about to happen.
9027. 
9028. He turned to Kozlovski with urgent questions.
9029. 
9030. "Immediately, Prince," said Kozlovski. "Dispositions for Bagration."
9031. 
9032. "What about capitulation?"
9033. 
9034. "Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle."
9035. 
9036. Prince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard.
9037. Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened,
9038. and Kutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway.
9039. Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutuzov but the expression of the
9040. commander in chief's one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with
9041. thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He looked
9042. straight at his adjutant's face without recognizing him.
9043. 
9044. "Well, have you finished?" said he to Kozlovski.
9045. 
9046. "One moment, your excellency."
9047. 
9048. Bagration, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,
9049. impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.
9050. 
9051. "I have the honor to present myself," repeated Prince Andrew rather
9052. loudly, handing Kutuzov an envelope.
9053. 
9054. "Ah, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!"
9055. 
9056. Kutuzov went out into the porch with Bagration.
9057. 
9058. "Well, good-by, Prince," said he to Bagration. "My blessing, and may
9059. Christ be with you in your great endeavor!"
9060. 
9061. His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left
9062. hand he drew Bagration toward him, and with his right, on which he wore
9063. a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently
9064. habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagration kissed him on the neck
9065. instead.
9066. 
9067. "Christ be with you!" Kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriage.
9068. "Get in with me," said he to Bolkonski.
9069. 
9070. "Your excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain
9071. with Prince Bagration's detachment."
9072. 
9073. "Get in," said Kutuzov, and noticing that Bolkonski still delayed, he
9074. added: "I need good officers myself, need them myself!"
9075. 
9076. They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.
9077. 
9078. "There is still much, much before us," he said, as if with an old man's
9079. penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkonski's mind. "If
9080. a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God," he added as
9081. if speaking to himself.
9082. 
9083. Prince Andrew glanced at Kutuzov's face only a foot distant from him and
9084. involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his
9085. temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty eye
9086. socket. "Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men's death,"
9087. thought Bolkonski.
9088. 
9089. "That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment," he said.
9090. 
9091. Kutuzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been
9092. saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying
9093. on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew.
9094. There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he
9095. questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the
9096. Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems
9097. affair, and about some ladies they both knew.
9098. 
9099. 
9100. 
9101. 
9102. 
9103. CHAPTER XIV
9104. 
9105. 
9106. On November 1 Kutuzov had received, through a spy, news that the army he
9107. commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that the
9108. French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in immense
9109. force upon Kutuzov's line of communication with the troops that were
9110. arriving from Russia. If Kutuzov decided to remain at Krems, Napoleon's
9111. army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely
9112. and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he would find
9113. himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If Kutuzov decided to abandon
9114. the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia, he would
9115. have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains,
9116. defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning
9117. all hope of a junction with Buxhowden. If Kutuzov decided to retreat
9118. along the road from Krems to Olmutz, to unite with the troops arriving
9119. from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road by the French
9120. who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and
9121. transport, having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three
9122. times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.
9123. 
9124. Kutuzov chose this latter course.
9125. 
9126. The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were
9127. advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles off
9128. on the line of Kutuzov's retreat. If he reached Znaim before the
9129. French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the
9130. French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a
9131. disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall
9132. the French with his whole army was impossible. The road for the French
9133. from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the
9134. Russians from Krems to Znaim.
9135. 
9136. The night he received the news, Kutuzov sent Bagration's vanguard, four
9137. thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim to
9138. the Vienna-Znaim road. Bagration was to make this march without resting,
9139. and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he succeeded
9140. in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible.
9141. Kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.
9142. 
9143. Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his
9144. hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers
9145. by the way, Bagration came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrunn
9146. a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrunn from
9147. Vienna. Kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some days
9148. before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagration with his four thousand
9149. hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army
9150. that came upon him at Hollabrunn, which was clearly impossible. But a
9151. freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick
9152. that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without
9153. a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutuzov in a similar way. Meeting
9154. Bagration's weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be
9155. Kutuzov's whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the
9156. arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna,
9157. and with this object offered a three days' truce on condition that both
9158. armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared that
9159. negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he therefore
9160. offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count Nostitz, the
9161. Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed Murat's emissary
9162. and retired, leaving Bagration's division exposed. Another emissary rode
9163. to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the
9164. Russian army the three days' truce. Bagration replied that he was not
9165. authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to
9166. Kutuzov to report the offer he had received.
9167. 
9168. A truce was Kutuzov's sole chance of gaining time, giving Bagration's
9169. exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys
9170. (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance if but one
9171. stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and a quite
9172. unexpected, chance of saving the army. On receiving the news he
9173. immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in
9174. attendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely
9175. to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and
9176. meanwhile Kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the
9177. movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim
9178. road. Bagration's exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone covered
9179. this movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to remain
9180. stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.
9181. 
9182. Kutuzov's expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were in
9183. no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass, and
9184. also that Murat's mistake would very soon be discovered, proved
9185. correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Schonbrunn, sixteen miles from
9186. Hollabrunn) received Murat's dispatch with the proposal of a truce and
9187. a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to
9188. Murat:
9189. 
9190. 
9191. Schonbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,
9192. 
9193. at eight o'clock in the morning
9194. 
9195. To PRINCE MURAT,
9196. 
9197. I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only
9198. my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my
9199. order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break
9200. the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the
9201. general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no
9202. one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.
9203. 
9204. If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will
9205. ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian
9206. army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.
9207. 
9208. The Russian Emperor's aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing
9209. when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians let
9210. themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are
9211. letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.
9212. 
9213. NAPOLEON
9214. 
9215. 
9216. Bonaparte's adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to
9217. Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all
9218. the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim
9219. escape, and Bagration's four thousand men merrily lighted campfires,
9220. dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time
9221. for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store
9222. for him.
9223. 
9224. 
9225. 
9226. 
9227. 
9228. CHAPTER XV
9229. 
9230. 
9231. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who had
9232. persisted in his request to Kutuzov, arrived at Grunth and reported
9233. himself to Bagration. Bonaparte's adjutant had not yet reached Murat's
9234. detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagration's detachment
9235. no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They talked of
9236. peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked of a battle
9237. but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement. Bagration,
9238. knowing Bolkonski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him
9239. with distinction and special marks of favor, explaining to him that
9240. there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and giving
9241. him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the
9242. rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, "which is also very
9243. important."
9244. 
9245. "However, there will hardly be an engagement today," said Bagration as
9246. if to reassure Prince Andrew.
9247. 
9248. "If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal
9249. he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he wishes to
9250. stay with me, let him... he'll be of use here if he's a brave officer,"
9251. thought Bagration. Prince Andrew, without replying, asked the prince's
9252. permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the
9253. forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an
9254. order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a
9255. diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking French though
9256. he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.
9257. 
9258. On all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who
9259. seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches,
9260. and fencing from the village.
9261. 
9262. "There now, Prince! We can't stop those fellows," said the staff officer
9263. pointing to the soldiers. "The officers don't keep them in hand. And
9264. there," he pointed to a sutler's tent, "they crowd in and sit. This
9265. morning I turned them all out and now look, it's full again. I must go
9266. there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It won't take a moment."
9267. 
9268. "Yes, let's go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese," said
9269. Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.
9270. 
9271. "Why didn't you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you something."
9272. 
9273. They dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and
9274. weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.
9275. 
9276. "Now what does this mean, gentlemen?" said the staff officer, in the
9277. reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than
9278. once. "You know it won't do to leave your posts like this. The prince
9279. gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you, Captain," and he
9280. turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots
9281. (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings,
9282. rose when they entered, smiling not altogether comfortably.
9283. 
9284. "Well, aren't you ashamed of yourself, Captain Tushin?" he continued.
9285. "One would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good
9286. example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be sounded
9287. and you'll be in a pretty position without your boots!" (The staff
9288. officer smiled.) "Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of you,
9289. all!" he added in a tone of command.
9290. 
9291. Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer
9292. Tushin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to the
9293. other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes from
9294. Prince Andrew to the staff officer.
9295. 
9296. "The soldiers say it feels easier without boots," said Captain Tushin
9297. smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing to adopt
9298. a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his jest was
9299. unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.
9300. 
9301. "Kindly return to your posts," said the staff officer trying to preserve
9302. his gravity.
9303. 
9304. Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer's small figure.
9305. There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic,
9306. but extremely attractive.
9307. 
9308. The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.
9309. 
9310. Having ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking
9311. soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some
9312. entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up
9313. red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite
9314. the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants;
9315. spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the
9316. bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at
9317. the entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some
9318. dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the
9319. entrenchment. They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a
9320. trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.
9321. 
9322. "Voila l'agrement des camps, monsieur le Prince," * said the staff
9323. officer.
9324. 
9325. 
9326.     * "This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince."
9327. 
9328. 
9329. They rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could already be
9330. seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.
9331. 
9332. "That's our battery," said the staff officer indicating the highest
9333. point. "It's in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots. You
9334. can see everything from there; let's go there, Prince."
9335. 
9336. "Thank you very much, I will go on alone," said Prince Andrew, wishing
9337. to rid himself of this staff officer's company, "please don't trouble
9338. yourself further."
9339. 
9340. The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.
9341. 
9342. The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and
9343. cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been
9344. in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven
9345. miles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm
9346. could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the
9347. more confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in
9348. their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company
9349. officers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in
9350. the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over
9351. the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building
9352. shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others,
9353. dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending
9354. boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers.
9355. In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly
9356. at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster
9357. sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log
9358. before his shelter, had been tasted.
9359. 
9360. Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka,
9361. crowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting
9362. a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him. The
9363. soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces,
9364. emptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from
9365. the sergeant major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and
9366. wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were
9367. as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful
9368. encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in
9369. which at least half of them would be left on the field. After passing a
9370. chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiers--fine fellows
9371. busy with similar peaceful affairs--near the shelter of the regimental
9372. commander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrew came
9373. out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two
9374. soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and
9375. striking him regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally.
9376. A stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the
9377. screams kept repeating:
9378. 
9379. "It's a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest,
9380. honorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in
9381. him, he's a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!"
9382. 
9383. So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural
9384. screams, continued.
9385. 
9386. "Go on, go on!" said the major.
9387. 
9388. A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face
9389. stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant
9390. as he rode by.
9391. 
9392. Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our front
9393. line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks,
9394. but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that
9395. morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one
9396. another's faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers who
9397. formed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers
9398. who, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.
9399. 
9400. Since early morning--despite an injunction not to approach the picket
9401. line--the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away. The
9402. soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity,
9403. no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and
9404. grew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look
9405. at the French.
9406. 
9407. "Look! Look there!" one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a
9408. Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and
9409. was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. "Hark to him
9410. jabbering! Fine, isn't it? It's all the Frenchy can do to keep up with
9411. him. There now, Sidorov!"
9412. 
9413. "Wait a bit and listen. It's fine!" answered Sidorov, who was considered
9414. an adept at French.
9415. 
9416. The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dolokhov. Prince Andrew
9417. recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. Dolokhov had
9418. come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with his
9419. captain.
9420. 
9421. "Now then, go on, go on!" incited the officer, bending forward and
9422. trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to
9423. him. "More, please: more! What's he saying?"
9424. 
9425. Dolokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot
9426. dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the
9427. campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was
9428. trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all
9429. the way from Ulm, while Dolokhov maintained that the Russians had not
9430. surrendered but had beaten the French.
9431. 
9432. "We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off," said
9433. Dolokhov.
9434. 
9435. "Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!" said the
9436. French grenadier.
9437. 
9438. The French onlookers and listeners laughed.
9439. 
9440. "We'll make you dance as we did under Suvorov...," * said Dolokhov.
9441. 
9442. 
9443.     * "On vous fera danser."
9444. 
9445. 
9446. "Qu' est-ce qu'il chante?" * asked a Frenchman.
9447. 
9448. 
9449.     * "What's he singing about?"
9450. 
9451. 
9452. "It's ancient history," said another, guessing that it referred to a
9453. former war. "The Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the
9454. others..."
9455. 
9456. "Bonaparte..." began Dolokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.
9457. 
9458. "Not Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! Sacre nom...!" cried he angrily.
9459. 
9460. "The devil skin your Emperor."
9461. 
9462. And Dolokhov swore at him in coarse soldier's Russian and shouldering
9463. his musket walked away.
9464. 
9465. "Let us go, Ivan Lukich," he said to the captain.
9466. 
9467. "Ah, that's the way to talk French," said the picket soldiers. "Now,
9468. Sidorov, you have a try!"
9469. 
9470. Sidorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless
9471. sounds very fast: "Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kaska," he said,
9472. trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.
9473. 
9474. "Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!" came peals of such healthy and
9475. good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French
9476. involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be
9477. to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as
9478. quickly as possible.
9479. 
9480. But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and
9481. entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon
9482. confronted one another as before.
9483. 
9484. 
9485. 
9486. 
9487. 
9488. CHAPTER XVI
9489. 
9490. 
9491. Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince
9492. Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had
9493. told him the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped
9494. beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an
9495. artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the
9496. officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing.
9497. Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes
9498. and artillerymen's bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest
9499. cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the
9500. sound of officers' voices in eager conversation.
9501. 
9502. It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the
9503. greater part of the enemy's opened out from this battery. Just facing
9504. it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Schon Grabern
9505. could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops
9506. amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were
9507. evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left from
9508. that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it
9509. was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was
9510. posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position.
9511. Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the
9512. dragoons. In the center, where Tushin's battery stood and from which
9513. Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most
9514. direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schon Grabern.
9515. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked the
9516. bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was
9517. wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us
9518. on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it
9519. difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took
9520. out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the
9521. position. He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to
9522. Bagration. His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the
9523. center, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the
9524. dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely
9525. following the mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying
9526. historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the
9527. course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He imagined
9528. only important possibilities: "If the enemy attacks the right flank,"
9529. he said to himself, "the Kiev grenadiers and the Podolsk chasseurs must
9530. hold their position till reserves from the center come up. In that case
9531. the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack. If they
9532. attack our center we, having the center battery on this high ground,
9533. shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and retreat to the dip by
9534. echelons." So he reasoned.... All the time he had been beside the gun,
9535. he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly, but as often happens
9536. had not understood a word of what they were saying. Suddenly, however,
9537. he was struck by a voice coming from the shed, and its tone was so
9538. sincere that he could not but listen.
9539. 
9540. "No, friend," said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a
9541. familiar voice, "what I say is that if it were possible to know what is
9542. beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. That's so, friend."
9543. 
9544. Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: "Afraid or not, you can't
9545. escape it anyhow."
9546. 
9547. "All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people," said a third manly
9548. voice interrupting them both. "Of course you artillery men are very
9549. wise, because you can take everything along with you--vodka and snacks."
9550. 
9551. And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,
9552. laughed.
9553. 
9554. "Yes, one is afraid," continued the first speaker, he of the familiar
9555. voice. "One is afraid of the unknown, that's what it is. Whatever we may
9556. say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is no sky but only
9557. an atmosphere."
9558. 
9559. The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.
9560. 
9561. "Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Tushin," it said.
9562. 
9563. "Why," thought Prince Andrew, "that's the captain who stood up in
9564. the sutler's hut without his boots." He recognized the agreeable,
9565. philosophizing voice with pleasure.
9566. 
9567. "Some herb vodka? Certainly!" said Tushin. "But still, to conceive a
9568. future life..."
9569. 
9570. He did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and
9571. nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it
9572. had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near
9573. the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground
9574. seemed to groan at the terrible impact.
9575. 
9576. And immediately Tushin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and
9577. his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed followed
9578. by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who hurried
9579. off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.
9580. 
9581. 
9582. 
9583. 
9584. 
9585. CHAPTER XVII
9586. 
9587. 
9588. Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery,
9589. looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes
9590. ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto
9591. motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was
9592. a battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two
9593. mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A
9594. small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill,
9595. probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had
9596. not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report.
9597. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back
9598. to Grunth to find Prince Bagration. He heard the cannonade behind him
9599. growing louder and more frequent. Evidently our guns had begun to reply.
9600. From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came
9601. the report of musketry.
9602. 
9603. Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte's stern letter,
9604. and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once
9605. moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian
9606. wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to
9607. crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.
9608. 
9609. "It has begun. Here it is!" thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood
9610. rush to his heart. "But where and how will my Toulon present itself?"
9611. 
9612. Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking
9613. vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid
9614. movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready,
9615. and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his
9616. heart. "It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!" was what the
9617. face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.
9618. 
9619. Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw,
9620. in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him.
9621. The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a
9622. white horse, was Prince Bagration. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for
9623. him to come up; Prince Bagration reined in his horse and recognizing
9624. Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew
9625. told him what he had seen.
9626. 
9627. The feeling, "It has begun! Here it is!" was seen even on Prince
9628. Bagration's hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes.
9629. Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face
9630. and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking and
9631. feeling at that moment. "Is there anything at all behind that impassive
9632. face?" Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince Bagration bent
9633. his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew told him, and
9634. said, "Very good!" in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that
9635. took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen.
9636. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke quickly.
9637. Prince Bagration, uttering his words with an Oriental accent, spoke
9638. particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there was no need to
9639. hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction of Tushin's
9640. battery. Prince Andrew followed with the suite. Behind Prince Bagration
9641. rode an officer of the suite, the prince's personal adjutant, Zherkov,
9642. an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed
9643. horse, and a civilian--an accountant who had asked permission to
9644. be present at the battle out of curiosity. The accountant, a stout,
9645. full-faced man, looked around him with a naive smile of satisfaction
9646. and presented a strange appearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and
9647. adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on his horse with a convoy
9648. officer's saddle.
9649. 
9650. "He wants to see a battle," said Zherkov to Bolkonski, pointing to the
9651. accountant, "but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already."
9652. 
9653. "Oh, leave off!" said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning
9654. smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherkov's joke, and
9655. purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.
9656. 
9657. "It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince," said the staff officer. (He
9658. remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a
9659. prince, but could not get it quite right.)
9660. 
9661. By this time they were all approaching Tushin's battery, and a ball
9662. struck the ground in front of them.
9663. 
9664. "What's that that has fallen?" asked the accountant with a naive smile.
9665. 
9666. "A French pancake," answered Zherkov.
9667. 
9668. "So that's what they hit with?" asked the accountant. "How awful!"
9669. 
9670. He seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished speaking
9671. when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly
9672. ended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding
9673. a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with
9674. his horse. Zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles and
9675. turned their horses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack,
9676. and examined him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the
9677. horse still struggled.
9678. 
9679. Prince Bagration screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the
9680. cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say, "Is
9681. it worth while noticing trifles?" He reined in his horse with the case
9682. of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his saber
9683. which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of a kind
9684. no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of Suvorov
9685. giving his saber to Bagration in Italy, and the recollection was
9686. particularly pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery at
9687. which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield.
9688. 
9689. "Whose company?" asked Prince Bagration of an artilleryman standing by
9690. the ammunition wagon.
9691. 
9692. He asked, "Whose company?" but he really meant, "Are you frightened
9693. here?" and the artilleryman understood him.
9694. 
9695. "Captain Tushin's, your excellency!" shouted the red-haired, freckled
9696. gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.
9697. 
9698. "Yes, yes," muttered Bagration as if considering something, and he rode
9699. past the limbers to the farthest cannon.
9700. 
9701. As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his
9702. suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see
9703. the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its
9704. former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding
9705. a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with
9706. a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon's mouth. The short,
9707. round-shouldered Captain Tushin, stumbling over the tail of the gun
9708. carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out
9709. shading his eyes with his small hand.
9710. 
9711. "Lift it two lines more and it will be just right," cried he in a feeble
9712. voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill suited to his weak
9713. figure. "Number Two!" he squeaked. "Fire, Medvedev!"
9714. 
9715. Bagration called to him, and Tushin, raising three fingers to his cap
9716. with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute
9717. but like a priest's benediction, approached the general. Though Tushin's
9718. guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing incendiary
9719. balls at the village of Schon Grabern visible just opposite, in front of
9720. which large masses of French were advancing.
9721. 
9722. No one had given Tushin orders where and at what to fire, but after
9723. consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchenko, for whom he had great
9724. respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the
9725. village. "Very good!" said Bagration in reply to the officer's report,
9726. and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before
9727. him. The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the height on
9728. which the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the rivulet
9729. flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard,
9730. and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of the
9731. suite pointed out to Bagration a French column that was outflanking us.
9732. To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince Bagration
9733. ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right
9734. flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that
9735. if these battalions went away, the guns would remain without support.
9736. Prince Bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at
9737. him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer's remark was
9738. just and that really no answer could be made to it. But at that moment
9739. an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the
9740. regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were
9741. coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was
9742. retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagration bowed his head in
9743. sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to the right and sent
9744. an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French. But this
9745. adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander
9746. of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as
9747. a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly, and
9748. so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood.
9749. 
9750. "Very good!" said Bagration.
9751. 
9752. As he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and
9753. as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there
9754. himself, Prince Bagration sent Zherkov to tell the general in command
9755. (the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutuzov at Braunau) that
9756. he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear,
9757. as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy's
9758. attack very long. About Tushin and the battalion that had been in
9759. support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened
9760. attentively to Bagration's colloquies with the commanding officers and
9761. the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders were
9762. really given, but that Prince Bagration tried to make it appear that
9763. everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of subordinate
9764. commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least in accord
9765. with his intentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that though what
9766. happened was due to chance and was independent of the commander's will,
9767. owing to the tact Bagration showed, his presence was very valuable.
9768. Officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm;
9769. soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his
9770. presence, and were evidently anxious to display their courage before
9771. him.
9772. 
9773. 
9774. 
9775. 
9776. 
9777. CHAPTER XVIII
9778. 
9779. 
9780. Prince Bagration, having reached the highest point of our right flank,
9781. began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where
9782. on account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to
9783. the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness
9784. of the actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a
9785. bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who
9786. supported him under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he
9787. was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or
9788. mouth. Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket,
9789. groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while
9790. blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had
9791. that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering.
9792. Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men
9793. lying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were
9794. unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and
9795. despite the general's presence were talking loudly and gesticulating.
9796. In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the
9797. smoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after
9798. the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. Bagration rode up
9799. to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning
9800. the sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with
9801. smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it. Some
9802. were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touchpans or
9803. taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who
9804. they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no
9805. wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were
9806. often heard. "What is this?" thought Prince Andrew approaching the crowd
9807. of soldiers. "It can't be an attack, for they are not moving; it can't
9808. be a square--for they are not drawn up for that."
9809. 
9810. The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a
9811. pleasant smile--his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes,
9812. giving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagration and welcomed him as
9813. a host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had
9814. been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been
9815. repulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack
9816. had been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had
9817. occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what
9818. had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and
9819. could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his
9820. regiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement
9821. of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and
9822. hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted "Cavalry!" and our
9823. men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the cavalry which
9824. had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the hollow and
9825. were firing at our men. Prince Bagration bowed his head as a sign
9826. that this was exactly what he had desired and expected. Turning to his
9827. adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the Sixth
9828. Chasseurs whom they had just passed. Prince Andrew was struck by
9829. the changed expression on Prince Bagration's face at this moment. It
9830. expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of
9831. a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water.
9832. The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation
9833. of profound thought. The round, steady, hawk's eyes looked before him
9834. eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his
9835. movements were still slow and measured.
9836. 
9837. The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagration, entreating him
9838. to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were. "Please,
9839. your excellency, for God's sake!" he kept saying, glancing for support
9840. at an officer of the suite who turned away from him. "There, you see!"
9841. and he drew attention to the bullets whistling, singing, and hissing
9842. continually around them. He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach
9843. that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: "We are
9844. used to it, but you, sir, will blister your hands." He spoke as if those
9845. bullets could not kill him, and his half-closed eyes gave still more
9846. persuasiveness to his words. The staff officer joined in the colonel's
9847. appeals, but Bagration did not reply; he only gave an order to
9848. cease firing and re-form, so as to give room for the two approaching
9849. battalions. While he was speaking, the curtain of smoke that had
9850. concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began to move from right
9851. to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the hill opposite, with
9852. the French moving about on it, opened out before them. All eyes fastened
9853. involuntarily on this French column advancing against them and winding
9854. down over the uneven ground. One could already see the soldiers' shaggy
9855. caps, distinguish the officers from the men, and see the standard
9856. flapping against its staff.
9857. 
9858. "They march splendidly," remarked someone in Bagration's suite.
9859. 
9860. The head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The clash
9861. would take place on this side of it...
9862. 
9863. The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up
9864. and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came
9865. two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had
9866. reached Bagration, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step
9867. could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to Bagration, marched
9868. a company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy
9869. expression--the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that
9870. moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he
9871. would appear as he passed the commander.
9872. 
9873. With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with
9874. his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full
9875. height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy
9876. tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close
9877. to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real
9878. weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men
9879. without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as
9880. if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander
9881. in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he
9882. was happy. "Left... left... left..." he seemed to repeat to himself at
9883. each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but varied faces,
9884. the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in
9885. step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating
9886. to himself at each alternate step, "Left... left... left..." A fat
9887. major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of step; a soldier who had
9888. fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his defection, ran at a trot,
9889. panting to catch up with his company. A cannon ball, cleaving the air,
9890. flew over the heads of Bagration and his suite, and fell into the
9891. column to the measure of "Left... left!" "Close up!" came the company
9892. commander's voice in jaunty tones. The soldiers passed in a semicircle
9893. round something where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the
9894. flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men,
9895. ran to catch up his line and, falling into step with a hop, looked back
9896. angrily, and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet
9897. beating the ground in unison, one seemed to hear left... left... left.
9898. 
9899. "Well done, lads!" said Prince Bagration.
9900. 
9901. "Glad to do our best, your ex'len-lency!" came a confused shout from
9902. the ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on
9903. Bagration as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: "We know
9904. that ourselves!" Another, without looking round, as though fearing to
9905. relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.
9906. 
9907. The order was given to halt and down knapsacks.
9908. 
9909. Bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted.
9910. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his felt coat,
9911. stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the French
9912. column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.
9913. 
9914. "Forward, with God!" said Bagration, in a resolute, sonorous voice,
9915. turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms,
9916. he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of
9917. a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him
9918. forward, and experienced great happiness.
9919. 
9920. The French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagration,
9921. could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their
9922. faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered legs
9923. and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince Bagration
9924. gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the
9925. ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the French, smoke
9926. appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots sounded. Several
9927. of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer who had marched so
9928. gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first report was heard,
9929. Bagration looked round and shouted, "Hurrah!"
9930. 
9931. "Hurrah--ah!--ah!" rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and passing
9932. Bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous
9933. and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.
9934. 
9935. 
9936. 
9937. 
9938. 
9939. CHAPTER XIX
9940. 
9941. 
9942. The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right
9943. flank. In the center Tushin's forgotten battery, which had managed to
9944. set fire to the Schon Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The
9945. French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus
9946. gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the center to the other side
9947. of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the
9948. different companies did not get mixed. But our left--which consisted
9949. of the Azov and Podolsk infantry and the Pavlograd hussars--was
9950. simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under
9951. Lannes and was thrown into confusion. Bagration had sent Zherkov to the
9952. general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately.
9953. 
9954. Zherkov, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about
9955. and galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagration than his courage
9956. failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it was
9957. dangerous.
9958. 
9959. Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the
9960. firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they
9961. could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.
9962. 
9963. The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of
9964. the regiment Kutuzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which Dolokhov was
9965. serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank had been
9966. assigned to the commander of the Pavlograd regiment in which Rostov
9967. was serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders were much
9968. exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on
9969. the right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged
9970. in discussion with the sole object of offending one another. But the
9971. regiments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the
9972. impending action. From privates to general they were not expecting a
9973. battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the
9974. horses and the infantry collecting wood.
9975. 
9976. "He higher iss dan I in rank," said the German colonel of the hussars,
9977. flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, "so let him do
9978. what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars... Bugler, sount ze
9979. retreat!"
9980. 
9981. But haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling
9982. together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes of
9983. Lannes' sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming
9984. up within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in command of
9985. the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and having mounted
9986. drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the Pavlograd
9987. commander. The commanders met with polite bows but with secret
9988. malevolence in their hearts.
9989. 
9990. "Once again, Colonel," said the general, "I can't leave half my men
9991. in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you," he repeated, "to occupy the
9992. position and prepare for an attack."
9993. 
9994. "I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!" suddenly
9995. replied the irate colonel. "If you vere in the cavalry..."
9996. 
9997. "I am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if you
9998. are not aware of the fact..."
9999. 
10000. "Quite avare, your excellency," suddenly shouted the colonel, touching
10001. his horse and turning purple in the face. "Vill you be so goot to
10002. come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don't vish to
10003. destroy my men for your pleasure!"
10004. 
10005. "You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure and
10006. I won't allow it to be said!"
10007. 
10008. Taking the colonel's outburst as a challenge to his courage, the general
10009. expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front line, as
10010. if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets. They
10011. reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and they halted in
10012. silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the line, for from
10013. where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible
10014. for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground, as well as that
10015. the French were outflanking our left. The general and colonel looked
10016. sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks
10017. preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice
10018. in the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As there was
10019. nothing to be said, and neither wished to give occasion for it to be
10020. alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire, they
10021. would have remained there for a long time testing each other's courage
10022. had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a
10023. muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The French had attacked
10024. the men collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible for the
10025. hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from the line of
10026. retreat on the left by the French. However inconvenient the position, it
10027. was now necessary to attack in order to cut away through for themselves.
10028. 
10029. The squadron in which Rostov was serving had scarcely time to mount
10030. before it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge,
10031. there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that
10032. terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear--resembling the line
10033. separating the living from the dead--lay between them. All were
10034. conscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross
10035. it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.
10036. 
10037. The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put
10038. to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having
10039. his own way, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor
10040. of an attack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang
10041. out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards.
10042. Still no one moved. The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars
10043. alike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this
10044. irresolution communicated itself to the men.
10045. 
10046. "If only they would be quick!" thought Rostov, feeling that at last
10047. the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so
10048. often heard from his fellow hussars.
10049. 
10050. "Fo'ward, with God, lads!" rang out Denisov's voice. "At a twot
10051. fo'ward!"
10052. 
10053. The horses' croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the
10054. reins and started of his own accord.
10055. 
10056. Before him, on the right, Rostov saw the front lines of his hussars and
10057. still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but
10058. took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off.
10059. 
10060. "Faster!" came the word of command, and Rostov felt Rook's flanks
10061. drooping as he broke into a gallop.
10062. 
10063. Rostov anticipated his horse's movements and became more and more
10064. elated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been
10065. in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible--and now he
10066. had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but
10067. everything was becoming more and more happy and animated. "Oh, how I
10068. will slash at him!" thought Rostov, gripping the hilt of his saber.
10069. 
10070. "Hur-a-a-a-ah!" came a roar of voices. "Let anyone come my way now,"
10071. thought Rostov driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a full
10072. gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was already
10073. visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the
10074. squadron. Rostov raised his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant
10075. the trooper Nikitenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and
10076. Rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward
10077. with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From behind him
10078. Bondarchuk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked angrily at
10079. him. Bondarchuk's horse swerved and galloped past.
10080. 
10081. "How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!" Rostov asked
10082. and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a field.
10083. Instead of the moving horses and hussars' backs, he saw nothing before
10084. him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There was warm
10085. blood under his arm. "No, I am wounded and the horse is killed." Rook
10086. tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his rider's leg.
10087. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled but could not rise. Rostov
10088. also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache having become entangled
10089. in the saddle. Where our men were, and where the French, he did not
10090. know. There was no one near.
10091. 
10092. Having disentangled his leg, he rose. "Where, on which side, was now the
10093. line that had so sharply divided the two armies?" he asked himself and
10094. could not answer. "Can something bad have happened to me?" he wondered
10095. as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was
10096. hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if it were not his.
10097. He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find blood on it. "Ah,
10098. here are people coming," he thought joyfully, seeing some men running
10099. toward him. "They will help me!" In front came a man wearing a strange
10100. shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a hooked nose. Then
10101. came two more, and many more running behind. One of them said something
10102. strange, not in Russian. In among the hindmost of these men wearing
10103. similar shakos was a Russian hussar. He was being held by the arms and
10104. his horse was being led behind him.
10105. 
10106. "It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will take
10107. me too? Who are these men?" thought Rostov, scarcely believing his eyes.
10108. "Can they be French?" He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and though
10109. but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them
10110. to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe
10111. his eyes. "Who are they? Why are they running? Can they be coming at me?
10112. And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone is so fond of?" He remembered
10113. his mother's love for him, and his family's, and his friends', and the
10114. enemy's intention to kill him seemed impossible. "But perhaps they may
10115. do it!" For more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or
10116. realizing the situation. The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked
10117. nose, was already so close that the expression of his face could be
10118. seen. And the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down,
10119. holding his breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rostov. He seized
10120. his pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and
10121. ran with all his might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the
10122. feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge,
10123. but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single
10124. sentiment, that of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his
10125. whole being. Rapidly leaping the furrows, he fled across the field with
10126. the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay, now and then turning his
10127. good-natured, pale, young face to look back. A shudder of terror went
10128. through him: "No, better not look," he thought, but having reached the
10129. bushes he glanced round once more. The French had fallen behind, and
10130. just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and,
10131. turning, shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back. Rostov
10132. paused. "No, there's some mistake," thought he. "They can't have wanted
10133. to kill me." But at the same time, his left arm felt as heavy as if
10134. a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He could run no more. The
10135. Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostov closed his eyes and stooped
10136. down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered his
10137. last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and
10138. reached the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.
10139. 
10140. 
10141. 
10142. 
10143. 
10144. CHAPTER XX
10145. 
10146. 
10147. The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts
10148. of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and
10149. retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the
10150. senseless cry, "Cut off!" that is so terrible in battle, and that word
10151. infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.
10152. 
10153. "Surrounded! Cut off? We're lost!" shouted the fugitives.
10154. 
10155. The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general
10156. realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the
10157. thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years' service who had
10158. never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters for
10159. negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the
10160. recalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above
10161. all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation, he
10162. clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to
10163. the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, but fortunately
10164. missed him. His one desire was to know what was happening and at any
10165. cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made one, so that he,
10166. an exemplary officer of twenty-two years' service, who had never been
10167. censured, should not be held to blame.
10168. 
10169. Having galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind
10170. the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and
10171. descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides
10172. the fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers
10173. attend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him,
10174. continue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem
10175. so terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance
10176. distorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of
10177. his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the
10178. air, and disobeying orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate
10179. of battles was evidently culminating in a panic.
10180. 
10181. The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
10182. powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that
10183. moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent
10184. reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian
10185. sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was Timokhin's company,
10186. which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having lain in
10187. ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly. Timokhin, armed
10188. only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and
10189. such mad, drunken determination that, taken by surprise, the French had
10190. thrown down their muskets and run. Dolokhov, running beside Timokhin,
10191. killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the
10192. surrendering French officer by his collar. Our fugitives returned, the
10193. battalions re-formed, and the French who had nearly cut our left flank
10194. in half were for the moment repulsed. Our reserve units were able to
10195. join up, and the fight was at an end. The regimental commander and Major
10196. Ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies
10197. pass by them, when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander's
10198. stirrup, almost leaning against him. The man was wearing a bluish coat
10199. of broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was bandaged, and
10200. over his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung. He had an officer's
10201. sword in his hand. The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently
10202. into the commander's face, and his lips were smiling. Though the
10203. commander was occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonomov, he
10204. could not help taking notice of the soldier.
10205. 
10206. "Your excellency, here are two trophies," said Dolokhov, pointing to the
10207. French sword and pouch. "I have taken an officer prisoner. I stopped the
10208. company." Dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt
10209. sentences. "The whole company can bear witness. I beg you will remember
10210. this, your excellency!"
10211. 
10212. "All right, all right," replied the commander, and turned to Major
10213. Ekonomov.
10214. 
10215. But Dolokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his
10216. head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.
10217. 
10218. "A bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your excellency!"
10219. 
10220. 
10221. Tushin's battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the
10222. action did Prince Bagration, still hearing the cannonade in the center,
10223. send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order
10224. the battery to retire as quickly as possible. When the supports attached
10225. to Tushin's battery had been moved away in the middle of the action
10226. by someone's order, the battery had continued firing and was only not
10227. captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone
10228. could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended
10229. guns. On the contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the
10230. French to suppose that here--in the center--the main Russian forces were
10231. concentrated. Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on each
10232. occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns
10233. on the hillock.
10234. 
10235. Soon after Prince Bagration had left him, Tushin had succeeded in
10236. setting fire to Schon Grabern.
10237. 
10238. "Look at them scurrying! It's burning! Just see the smoke! Fine! Grand!
10239. Look at the smoke, the smoke!" exclaimed the artillerymen, brightening
10240. up.
10241. 
10242. All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the
10243. direction of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers
10244. cried at each shot: "Fine! That's good! Look at it... Grand!" The fire,
10245. fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns that had
10246. advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge for this
10247. failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began
10248. firing them at Tushin's battery.
10249. 
10250. In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in
10251. successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this
10252. battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one
10253. knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon
10254. driver's leg. Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished,
10255. but only changed character. The horses were replaced by others from a
10256. reserve gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns
10257. were turned against the ten-gun battery. Tushin's companion officer
10258. had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour
10259. seventeen of the forty men of the guns' crews had been disabled, but the
10260. artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever. Twice they noticed
10261. the French appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot at them.
10262. 
10263. Little Tushin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to
10264. "refill my pipe for that one!" and then, scattering sparks from it, ran
10265. forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.
10266. 
10267. "Smack at 'em, lads!" he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wheels and
10268. working the screws himself.
10269. 
10270. Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him
10271. jump, Tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun, now
10272. aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing dead
10273. or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his feeble
10274. voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and more
10275. animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn
10276. away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always the
10277. case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers, for the
10278. most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery
10279. company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their
10280. officer--all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing
10281. situation, and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on
10282. theirs.
10283. 
10284. Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and
10285. activity, Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of
10286. fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never
10287. occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It
10288. seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he
10289. had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner
10290. of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground. Though he
10291. thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the
10292. best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to
10293. feverish delirium or drunkenness.
10294. 
10295. From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and
10296. thud of the enemy's cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces
10297. of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men
10298. and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy's side (always
10299. followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a
10300. horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his
10301. own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him
10302. pleasure. The enemy's guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from
10303. which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.
10304. 
10305. "There... he's puffing again," muttered Tushin to himself, as a small
10306. cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the
10307. wind.
10308. 
10309. "Now look out for the ball... we'll throw it back."
10310. 
10311. "What do you want, your honor?" asked an artilleryman, standing close
10312. by, who heard him muttering.
10313. 
10314. "Nothing... only a shell..." he answered.
10315. 
10316. "Come along, our Matvevna!" he said to himself. "Matvevna" * was the
10317. name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which was large
10318. and of an old pattern. The French swarming round their guns seemed to
10319. him like ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One of the
10320. second gun's crew was "uncle"; Tushin looked at him more often than
10321. at anyone else and took delight in his every movement. The sound of
10322. musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now increasing,
10323. seemed like someone's breathing. He listened intently to the ebb and
10324. flow of these sounds.
10325. 
10326. 
10327.     * Daughter of Matthew.
10328. 
10329. 
10330. "Ah! Breathing again, breathing!" he muttered to himself.
10331. 
10332. He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing
10333. cannon balls at the French with both hands.
10334. 
10335. "Now then, Matvevna, dear old lady, don't let me down!" he was saying as
10336. he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called above his
10337. head: "Captain Tushin! Captain!"
10338. 
10339. Tushin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned
10340. him out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice:
10341. 
10342. "Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you..."
10343. 
10344. "Why are they down on me?" thought Tushin, looking in alarm at his
10345. superior.
10346. 
10347. "I... don't..." he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap. "I..."
10348. 
10349. But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon
10350. ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse.
10351. He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball
10352. stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.
10353. 
10354. "Retire! All to retire!" he shouted from a distance.
10355. 
10356. The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same
10357. order.
10358. 
10359. It was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space
10360. where Tushin's guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a
10361. broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses.
10362. Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay
10363. several dead men. One ball after another passed over as he approached
10364. and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought
10365. of being afraid roused him again. "I cannot be afraid," thought he, and
10366. dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the order and did not
10367. leave the battery. He decided to have the guns removed from their
10368. positions and withdrawn in his presence. Together with Tushin, stepping
10369. across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended
10370. to the removal of the guns.
10371. 
10372. "A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off," said an
10373. artilleryman to Prince Andrew. "Not like your honor!"
10374. 
10375. Prince Andrew said nothing to Tushin. They were both so busy as to seem
10376. not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two cannon
10377. that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill
10378. (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode
10379. up to Tushin.
10380. 
10381. "Well, till we meet again..." he said, holding out his hand to Tushin.
10382. 
10383. "Good-by, my dear fellow," said Tushin. "Dear soul! Good-by, my dear
10384. fellow!" and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes.
10385. 
10386. 
10387. 
10388. 
10389. 
10390. CHAPTER XXI
10391. 
10392. 
10393. The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke,
10394. hung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing
10395. dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The
10396. cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on
10397. the right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as Tushin with his guns,
10398. continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range
10399. of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff,
10400. among them the staff officer and Zherkov, who had been twice sent to
10401. Tushin's battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one another,
10402. they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed,
10403. reprimanding and reproaching him. Tushin gave no orders, and,
10404. silently--fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep
10405. without knowing why--rode behind on his artillery nag. Though the orders
10406. were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves after
10407. troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty infantry
10408. officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Tushin's wattle
10409. shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on "Matvevna's" carriage.
10410. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting one hand with
10411. the other, came up to Tushin and asked for a seat.
10412. 
10413. "Captain, for God's sake! I've hurt my arm," he said timidly. "For God's
10414. sake... I can't walk. For God's sake!"
10415. 
10416. It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and
10417. been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.
10418. 
10419. "Tell them to give me a seat, for God's sake!"
10420. 
10421. "Give him a seat," said Tushin. "Lay a cloak for him to sit on, lad,"
10422. he said, addressing his favorite soldier. "And where is the wounded
10423. officer?"
10424. 
10425. "He has been set down. He died," replied someone.
10426. 
10427. "Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,
10428. Antonov."
10429. 
10430. The cadet was Rostov. With one hand he supported the other; he was pale
10431. and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on "Matvevna,"
10432. the gun from which they had removed the dead officer. The cloak they
10433. spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm.
10434. 
10435. "What, are you wounded, my lad?" said Tushin, approaching the gun on
10436. which Rostov sat.
10437. 
10438. "No, it's a sprain."
10439. 
10440. "Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?" inquired Tushin.
10441. 
10442. "It was the officer, your honor, stained it," answered the artilleryman,
10443. wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if apologizing for the
10444. state of his gun.
10445. 
10446. It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the
10447. infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It
10448. had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces
10449. off, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by on the
10450. right, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in
10451. the darkness. This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers
10452. who had sheltered in the village houses. They all rushed out of the
10453. village again, but Tushin's guns could not move, and the artillerymen,
10454. Tushin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their
10455. fate. The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly, streamed out
10456. of a side street.
10457. 
10458. "Not hurt, Petrov?" asked one.
10459. 
10460. "We've given it 'em hot, mate! They won't make another push now," said
10461. another.
10462. 
10463. "You couldn't see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows! Nothing
10464. could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn't there something to drink?"
10465. 
10466. The French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in
10467. the complete darkness Tushin's guns moved forward, surrounded by the
10468. humming infantry as by a frame.
10469. 
10470. In the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing
10471. always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of
10472. hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the
10473. wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness
10474. of the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their
10475. groans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night.
10476. After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on a
10477. white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing: "What
10478. did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?" came eager
10479. questions from all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing closer
10480. together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt: evidently
10481. those in front had halted. All remained where they were in the middle of
10482. the muddy road.
10483. 
10484. Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain Tushin,
10485. having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing
10486. station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the
10487. soldiers had kindled on the road. Rostov, too, dragged himself to the
10488. fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole
10489. body. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by
10490. an excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory
10491. position. He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire,
10492. which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered
10493. figure of Tushin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him.
10494. Tushin's large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and
10495. commiseration on Rostov, who saw that Tushin with his whole heart wished
10496. to help him but could not.
10497. 
10498. From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who
10499. were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The sound
10500. of voices, the tramping feet, the horses' hoofs moving in mud, the
10501. crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.
10502. 
10503. It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the
10504. gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.
10505. Rostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and
10506. around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held
10507. his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.
10508. 
10509. "You don't mind your honor?" he asked Tushin. "I've lost my company,
10510. your honor. I don't know where... such bad luck!"
10511. 
10512. With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to
10513. the bonfire, and addressing Tushin asked him to have the guns moved a
10514. trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to
10515. the campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying
10516. to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.
10517. 
10518. "You picked it up?... I dare say! You're very smart!" one of them
10519. shouted hoarsely.
10520. 
10521. Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg
10522. band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.
10523. 
10524. "Must one die like a dog?" said he.
10525. 
10526. Tushin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier ran
10527. up, begging a little fire for the infantry.
10528. 
10529. "A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow
10530. countrymen. Thanks for the fire--we'll return it with interest," said
10531. he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.
10532. 
10533. Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed
10534. by the fire. One of them stumbled.
10535. 
10536. "Who the devil has put the logs on the road?" snarled he.
10537. 
10538. "He's dead--why carry him?" said another.
10539. 
10540. "Shut up!"
10541. 
10542. And they disappeared into the darkness with their load.
10543. 
10544. "Still aching?" Tushin asked Rostov in a whisper.
10545. 
10546. "Yes."
10547. 
10548. "Your honor, you're wanted by the general. He is in the hut here," said
10549. a gunner, coming up to Tushin.
10550. 
10551. "Coming, friend."
10552. 
10553. Tushin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight, walked
10554. away from the fire.
10555. 
10556. Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared
10557. for him, Prince Bagration sat at dinner, talking with some commanding
10558. officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with
10559. the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the
10560. general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a
10561. glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet
10562. ring, and Zherkov, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew,
10563. pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes.
10564. 
10565. In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and
10566. the accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture, shaking his
10567. head in perplexity--perhaps because the banner really interested him,
10568. perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at
10569. a dinner where there was no place for him. In the next hut there was a
10570. French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers
10571. were flocking in to look at him. Prince Bagration was thanking the
10572. individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our
10573. losses. The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was
10574. informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn
10575. from the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the
10576. French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and
10577. had broken up the French troops.
10578. 
10579. "When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was
10580. disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: 'I'll let them come
10581. on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion'--and that's
10582. what I did."
10583. 
10584. The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed
10585. to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened. Perhaps
10586. it might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that
10587. confusion what did or did not happen?
10588. 
10589. "By the way, your excellency, I should inform you," he
10590. continued--remembering Dolokhov's conversation with Kutuzov and his last
10591. interview with the gentleman-ranker--"that Private Dolokhov, who was
10592. reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my presence and
10593. particularly distinguished himself."
10594. 
10595. "I saw the Pavlograd hussars attack there, your excellency," chimed in
10596. Zherkov, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all that
10597. day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer. "They broke up
10598. two squares, your excellency."
10599. 
10600. Several of those present smiled at Zherkov's words, expecting one of his
10601. usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory
10602. of our arms and of the day's work, they assumed a serious expression,
10603. though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any
10604. foundation. Prince Bagration turned to the old colonel:
10605. 
10606. "Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically: infantry,
10607. cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were abandoned in
10608. the center?" he inquired, searching with his eyes for someone. (Prince
10609. Bagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank; he knew that all
10610. the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action.)
10611. "I think I sent you?" he added, turning to the staff officer on duty.
10612. 
10613. "One was damaged," answered the staff officer, "and the other I can't
10614. understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only just
10615. left.... It is true that it was hot there," he added, modestly.
10616. 
10617. Someone mentioned that Captain Tushin was bivouacking close to the
10618. village and had already been sent for.
10619. 
10620. "Oh, but you were there?" said Prince Bagration, addressing Prince
10621. Andrew.
10622. 
10623. "Of course, we only just missed one another," said the staff officer,
10624. with a smile to Bolkonski.
10625. 
10626. "I had not the pleasure of seeing you," said Prince Andrew, coldly and
10627. abruptly.
10628. 
10629. All were silent. Tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way
10630. timidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the
10631. generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the
10632. sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and
10633. stumbled over it. Several of those present laughed.
10634. 
10635. "How was it a gun was abandoned?" asked Bagration, frowning, not so much
10636. at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom Zherkov laughed
10637. loudest.
10638. 
10639. Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt
10640. and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present
10641. themselves to Tushin in all their horror. He had been so excited that
10642. he had not thought about it until that moment. The officers' laughter
10643. confused him still more. He stood before Bagration with his lower
10644. jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: "I don't know... your
10645. excellency... I had no men... your excellency."
10646. 
10647. "You might have taken some from the covering troops."
10648. 
10649. Tushin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that
10650. was perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into
10651. trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagration as a schoolboy who has
10652. blundered looks at an examiner.
10653. 
10654. The silence lasted some time. Prince Bagration, apparently not wishing
10655. to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to
10656. intervene. Prince Andrew looked at Tushin from under his brows and his
10657. fingers twitched nervously.
10658. 
10659. "Your excellency!" Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt
10660. voice, "you were pleased to send me to Captain Tushin's battery. I went
10661. there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two guns
10662. smashed, and no supports at all."
10663. 
10664. Prince Bagration and Tushin looked with equal intentness at Bolkonski,
10665. who spoke with suppressed agitation.
10666. 
10667. "And, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion," he
10668. continued, "we owe today's success chiefly to the action of that battery
10669. and the heroic endurance of Captain Tushin and his company," and without
10670. awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.
10671. 
10672. Prince Bagration looked at Tushin, evidently reluctant to show distrust
10673. in Bolkonski's emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it,
10674. bent his head, and told Tushin that he could go. Prince Andrew went out
10675. with him.
10676. 
10677. "Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!" said Tushin.
10678. 
10679. Prince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He felt
10680. sad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.
10681. 
10682. 
10683. "Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will all
10684. this end?" thought Rostov, looking at the changing shadows before
10685. him. The pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible
10686. drowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the
10687. impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged
10688. with the physical pain. It was they, these soldiers--wounded and
10689. unwounded--it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting
10690. the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To
10691. rid himself of them he closed his eyes.
10692. 
10693. For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things
10694. appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand, Sonya's
10695. thin little shoulders, Natasha's eyes and laughter, Denisov with his
10696. voice and mustache, and Telyanin and all that affair with Telyanin and
10697. Bogdanich. That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh
10698. voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly,
10699. incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one
10700. direction. He tried to get away from them, but they would not for an
10701. instant let his shoulder move a hair's breadth. It would not ache--it
10702. would be well--if only they did not pull it, but it was impossible to
10703. get rid of them.
10704. 
10705. He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less
10706. than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were
10707. fluttering in that light. Tushin had not returned, the doctor had not
10708. come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at
10709. the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.
10710. 
10711. "Nobody wants me!" thought Rostov. "There is no one to help me or pity
10712. me. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved." He sighed and,
10713. doing so, groaned involuntarily.
10714. 
10715. "Eh, is anything hurting you?" asked the soldier, shaking his shirt out
10716. over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added:
10717. "What a lot of men have been crippled today--frightful!"
10718. 
10719. Rostov did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes
10720. fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm,
10721. bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his
10722. healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. "And why did
10723. I come here?" he wondered.
10724. 
10725. Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of
10726. Bagration's detachment was reunited to Kutuzov's army.
10727.

10738. CHAPTER I
10739. 
10740. 
10741. Prince Vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans.
10742. Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He
10743. was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had
10744. become a habit. Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted
10745. to himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life,
10746. were constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the
10747. circumstances and persons he met. Of these plans he had not merely one
10748. or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves,
10749. some approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He
10750. did not, for instance, say to himself: "This man now has influence, I
10751. must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special
10752. grant." Nor did he say to himself: "Pierre is a rich man, I must entice
10753. him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles I need."
10754. But when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told
10755. him that this man could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince
10756. Vasili took the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him,
10757. become intimate with him, and finally make his request.
10758. 
10759. He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as
10760. Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of
10761. Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to
10762. Petersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness,
10763. yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing,
10764. Prince Vasili did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had he
10765. thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and
10766. shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both
10767. above and below him in social standing. Something always drew him toward
10768. those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in
10769. seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people.
10770. 
10771. Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezukhov and a rich man, felt
10772. himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and
10773. preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to
10774. sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of
10775. which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his
10776. estate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not
10777. even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended
10778. and grieved had he chosen not to see them. These different
10779. people--businessmen, relations, and acquaintances alike--were all
10780. disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering
10781. manner: they were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierre's noble
10782. qualities. He was always hearing such words as: "With your remarkable
10783. kindness," or, "With your excellent heart," "You are yourself so
10784. honorable Count," or, "Were he as clever as you," and so on, till
10785. he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and
10786. extraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it
10787. had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent.
10788. Even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently
10789. unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate. The angry eldest
10790. princess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll's,
10791. had come into Pierre's room after the funeral. With drooping eyes
10792. and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past
10793. misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for
10794. anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received,
10795. to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where
10796. she had sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping at these
10797. words. Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre
10798. took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for.
10799. From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began
10800. knitting a striped scarf for him.
10801. 
10802. "Do this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with a
10803. great deal from the deceased," said Prince Vasili to him, handing him a
10804. deed to sign for the princess' benefit.
10805. 
10806. Prince Vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw
10807. this bone--a bill for thirty thousand rubles--to the poor princess that
10808. it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the
10809. inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess
10810. grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate to him,
10811. especially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made
10812. him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him.
10813. 
10814. It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it
10815. would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could
10816. not but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had
10817. no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not. He
10818. was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful
10819. intoxication. He felt as though he were the center of some important and
10820. general movement; that something was constantly expected of him, that if
10821. he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people, but if he
10822. did this and that, all would be well; and he did what was demanded of
10823. him, but still that happy result always remained in the future.
10824. 
10825. More than anyone else, Prince Vasili took possession of Pierre's affairs
10826. and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of Count
10827. Bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air of a
10828. man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for
10829. pity's sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of
10830. his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice
10831. of fate and the designs of rogues. During the few days he spent in
10832. Moscow after the death of Count Bezukhov, he would call Pierre, or go to
10833. him himself, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness
10834. and assurance, as if he were adding every time: "You know I am
10835. overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that I trouble
10836. myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I propose is
10837. the only thing possible."
10838. 
10839. "Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last," said Prince Vasili
10840. one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre's elbow, speaking as if
10841. he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could
10842. not now be altered. "We start tomorrow and I'm giving you a place in
10843. my carriage. I am very glad. All our important business here is now
10844. settled, and I ought to have been off long ago. Here is something I have
10845. received from the chancellor. I asked him for you, and you have been
10846. entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber.
10847. The diplomatic career now lies open before you."
10848. 
10849. Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words
10850. were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career,
10851. wished to make some suggestion. But Prince Vasili interrupted him in the
10852. special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting
10853. his speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was
10854. needed.
10855. 
10856. "Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience,
10857. and there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever complained yet of
10858. being too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it
10859. up tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself when you get to
10860. Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these terrible
10861. recollections." Prince Vasili sighed. "Yes, yes, my boy. And my valet
10862. can go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly forgetting," he added. "You
10863. know, mon cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so I have
10864. received what was due from the Ryazan estate and will keep it; you won't
10865. require it. We'll go into the accounts later."
10866. 
10867. By "what was due from the Ryazan estate" Prince Vasili meant several
10868. thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre's peasants, which the
10869. prince had retained for himself.
10870. 
10871. In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of
10872. gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the
10873. rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vasili had procured for him,
10874. and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous
10875. that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle,
10876. and continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never
10877. attained.
10878. 
10879. Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg.
10880. The Guards had gone to the front; Dolokhov had been reduced to the
10881. ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew
10882. was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he
10883. used to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with
10884. a friend older than himself and whom he respected. His whole time was
10885. taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince Vasili's
10886. house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and his beautiful
10887. daughter Helene.
10888. 
10889. Like the others, Anna Pavlovna Scherer showed Pierre the change of
10890. attitude toward him that had taken place in society.
10891. 
10892. Formerly in Anna Pavlovna's presence, Pierre had always felt that what
10893. he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that remarks
10894. which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish
10895. as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyte's stupidest
10896. remarks came out clever and apt. Now everything Pierre said was
10897. charmant. Even if Anna Pavlovna did not say so, he could see that she
10898. wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty.
10899. 
10900. In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna
10901. Pavlovna's usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added: "You
10902. will find the beautiful Helene here, whom it is always delightful to
10903. see."
10904. 
10905. When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some
10906. link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and
10907. Helene, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were
10908. being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an
10909. entertaining supposition.
10910. 
10911. Anna Pavlovna's "At Home" was like the former one, only the novelty she
10912. offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a diplomatist fresh
10913. from Berlin with the very latest details of the Emperor Alexander's
10914. visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august friends had pledged
10915. themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice
10916. against the enemy of the human race. Anna Pavlovna received Pierre with
10917. a shade of melancholy, evidently relating to the young man's recent loss
10918. by the death of Count Bezukhov (everyone constantly considered it a
10919. duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the
10920. father he had hardly known), and her melancholy was just like the august
10921. melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august Majesty the
10922. Empress Marya Fedorovna. Pierre felt flattered by this. Anna Pavlovna
10923. arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual
10924. skill. The large group, in which were Prince Vasili and the generals,
10925. had the benefit of the diplomat. Another group was at the tea table.
10926. Pierre wished to join the former, but Anna Pavlovna--who was in the
10927. excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands
10928. of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in
10929. action--seeing Pierre, touched his sleeve with her finger, saying:
10930. 
10931. "Wait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening." (She
10932. glanced at Helene and smiled at her.) "My dear Helene, be charitable to
10933. my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for ten minutes.
10934. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count who will not
10935. refuse to accompany you."
10936. 
10937. The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pavlovna detained Pierre, looking
10938. as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.
10939. 
10940. "Isn't she exquisite?" she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately
10941. beauty as she glided away. "And how she carries herself! For so young a
10942. girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from her
10943. heart. Happy the man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men
10944. would occupy a most brilliant position in society. Don't you think so? I
10945. only wanted to know your opinion," and Anna Pavlovna let Pierre go.
10946. 
10947. Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Helene's perfection of
10948. manner. If he ever thought of Helene, it was just of her beauty and her
10949. remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society.
10950. 
10951. The old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed
10952. desirous of hiding her adoration for Helene and inclined rather to show
10953. her fear of Anna Pavlovna. She looked at her niece, as if inquiring what
10954. she was to do with these people. On leaving them, Anna Pavlovna again
10955. touched Pierre's sleeve, saying: "I hope you won't say that it is dull
10956. in my house again," and she glanced at Helene.
10957. 
10958. Helene smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the
10959. possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt
10960. coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to see
10961. Helene, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome and
10962. the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation, Helene
10963. turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to
10964. everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little meaning
10965. for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just speaking of
10966. a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre's father, Count
10967. Bezukhov, and showed them her own box. Princess Helene asked to see the
10968. portrait of the aunt's husband on the box lid.
10969. 
10970. "That is probably the work of Vinesse," said Pierre, mentioning a
10971. celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the
10972. snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.
10973. 
10974. He half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox,
10975. passing it across Helene's back. Helene stooped forward to make room,
10976. and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at evening parties,
10977. wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at front and
10978. back. Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre, was
10979. so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the
10980. living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that he need
10981. only have bent his head a little to have touched them. He was conscious
10982. of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the creaking of her
10983. corset as she moved. He did not see her marble beauty forming a complete
10984. whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body only covered by her
10985. garments. And having once seen this he could not help being aware of it,
10986. just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through.
10987. 
10988. "So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?" Helene seemed to
10989. say. "You had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who
10990. may belong to anyone--to you too," said her glance. And at that moment
10991. Pierre felt that Helene not only could, but must, be his wife, and that
10992. it could not be otherwise.
10993. 
10994. He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the
10995. altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not
10996. even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why,
10997. that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.
10998. 
10999. Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see
11000. her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every
11001. day until then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more
11002. than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the
11003. mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has
11004. once recognized it to be a tuft of grass. She was terribly close to him.
11005. She already had power over him, and between them there was no longer any
11006. barrier except the barrier of his own will.
11007. 
11008. "Well, I will leave you in your little corner," came Anna Pavlovna's
11009. voice, "I see you are all right there."
11010. 
11011. And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything
11012. reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone
11013. knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.
11014. 
11015. A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pavlovna said
11016. to him: "I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?"
11017. 
11018. This was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and
11019. Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house
11020. done up.
11021. 
11022. "That's a good thing, but don't move from Prince Vasili's. It is good to
11023. have a friend like the prince," she said, smiling at Prince Vasili. "I
11024. know something about that. Don't I? And you are still so young. You need
11025. advice. Don't be angry with me for exercising an old woman's privilege."
11026. 
11027. She paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have
11028. mentioned their age. "If you marry it will be a different thing," she
11029. continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at
11030. Helene nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He
11031. muttered something and colored.
11032. 
11033. When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what
11034. had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood that
11035. the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was
11036. mentioned he had said absent-mindedly: "Yes, she's good looking," he had
11037. understood that this woman might belong to him.
11038. 
11039. "But she's stupid. I have myself said she is stupid," he thought. "There
11040. is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites in me.
11041. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she
11042. with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that's why he was sent
11043. away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince Vasili is her father... It's
11044. bad...." he reflected, but while he was thinking this (the reflection
11045. was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was conscious
11046. that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking of her
11047. worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife, how she
11048. would love him become quite different, and how all he had thought and
11049. heard of her might be false. And he again saw her not as the daughter
11050. of Prince Vasili, but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray
11051. dress. "But no! Why did this thought never occur to me before?" and
11052. again he told himself that it was impossible, that there would be
11053. something unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in this
11054. marriage. He recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks
11055. of those who had seen them together. He recalled Anna Pavlovna's words
11056. and looks when she spoke to him about his house, recalled thousands of
11057. such hints from Prince Vasili and others, and was seized by terror lest
11058. he had already, in some way, bound himself to do something that was
11059. evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But at the very time he was
11060. expressing this conviction to himself, in another part of his mind her
11061. image rose in all its womanly beauty.
11062. 
11063. 
11064. 
11065. 
11066. 
11067. CHAPTER II
11068. 
11069. 
11070. In November, 1805, Prince Vasili had to go on a tour of inspection in
11071. four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to
11072. visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole
11073. where his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas
11074. Bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that
11075. rich old man. But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs,
11076. Prince Vasili had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had
11077. latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in Prince Vasili's house
11078. where he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in
11079. Helene's presence (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed to
11080. her.
11081. 
11082. "This is all very fine, but things must be settled," said Prince Vasili
11083. to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that Pierre
11084. who was under such obligations to him ("But never mind that") was not
11085. behaving very well in this matter. "Youth, frivolity... well, God be
11086. with him," thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart, "but it must
11087. be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be Lelya's name day.
11088. I will invite two or three people, and if he does not understand what he
11089. ought to do then it will be my affair--yes, my affair. I am her father."
11090. 
11091. Six weeks after Anna Pavlovna's "At Home" and after the sleepless night
11092. when he had decided that to marry Helene would be a calamity and that he
11093. ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision, had not
11094. left Prince Vasili's and felt with terror that in people's eyes he was
11095. every day more and more connected with her, that it was impossible for
11096. him to return to his former conception of her, that he could not break
11097. away from her, and that though it would be a terrible thing he would
11098. have to unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have been able
11099. to free himself but that Prince Vasili (who had rarely before given
11100. receptions) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party
11101. at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general
11102. pleasure and disappoint everyone's expectation. Prince Vasili, in the
11103. rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierre's hand in passing
11104. and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled,
11105. clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: "Till tomorrow,"
11106. or, "Be in to dinner or I shall not see you," or, "I am staying in for
11107. your sake," and so on. And though Prince Vasili, when he stayed in (as
11108. he said) for Pierre's sake, hardly exchanged a couple of words with him,
11109. Pierre felt unable to disappoint him. Every day he said to himself one
11110. and the same thing: "It is time I understood her and made up my mind
11111. what she really is. Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No, she
11112. is not stupid, she is an excellent girl," he sometimes said to himself
11113. "she never makes a mistake, never says anything stupid. She says little,
11114. but what she does say is always clear and simple, so she is not stupid.
11115. She never was abashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad
11116. woman!" He had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in
11117. her company, and she had always answered him either by a brief but
11118. appropriate remark--showing that it did not interest her--or by a silent
11119. look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed Pierre her
11120. superiority. She was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in
11121. comparison with that smile.
11122. 
11123. She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him
11124. alone, in which there was something more significant than in the general
11125. smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was
11126. waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that
11127. sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror
11128. seized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during
11129. that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to
11130. that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: "What am I doing? I need
11131. resolution. Can it be that I have none?"
11132. 
11133. He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter
11134. he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really
11135. possessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel
11136. themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered by
11137. a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna Pavlovna's,
11138. an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will.
11139. 
11140. On Helene's name day, a small party of just their own people--as his
11141. wife said--met for supper at Prince Vasili's. All these friends and
11142. relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl
11143. would be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper.
11144. Princess Kuragina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome,
11145. was sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the
11146. more important guests--an old general and his wife, and Anna Pavlovna
11147. Scherer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests, and
11148. there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and Helene, side by
11149. side. Prince Vasili was not having any supper: he went round the table
11150. in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of the guests.
11151. To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to
11152. Pierre and Helene, whose presence he seemed not to notice. He enlivened
11153. the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal
11154. gleamed, so did the ladies' toilets and the gold and silver of the
11155. men's epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table, the
11156. clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with the animated hum of
11157. several conversations. At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was
11158. heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately, at which
11159. she laughed; at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of
11160. some Mary Viktorovna or other. At the center of the table, Prince Vasili
11161. attracted everybody's attention. With a facetious smile on his face, he
11162. was telling the ladies about last Wednesday's meeting of the Imperial
11163. Council, at which Sergey Kuzmich Vyazmitinov, the new military governor
11164. general of Petersburg, had received and read the then famous rescript
11165. of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergey Kuzmich, in which the
11166. Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of
11167. the people's loyalty, that the declaration from Petersburg gave him
11168. particular pleasure, and that he was proud to be at the head of such a
11169. nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it. This rescript began with
11170. the words: "Sergey Kuzmich, From all sides reports reach me," etc.
11171. 
11172. "Well, and so he never got farther than: 'Sergey Kuzmich'?" asked one of
11173. the ladies.
11174. 
11175. "Exactly, not a hair's breadth farther," answered Prince Vasili,
11176. laughing, "'Sergey Kuzmich... From all sides... From all sides... Sergey
11177. Kuzmich...' Poor Vyazmitinov could not get any farther! He began the
11178. rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered 'Sergey' he sobbed,
11179. 'Kuz-mi-ch,' tears, and 'From all sides' was smothered in sobs and he
11180. could get no farther. And again his handkerchief, and again: 'Sergey
11181. Kuzmich, From all sides,'... and tears, till at last somebody else was
11182. asked to read it."
11183. 
11184. "Kuzmich... From all sides... and then tears," someone repeated
11185. laughing.
11186. 
11187. "Don't be unkind," cried Anna Pavlovna from her end of the table holding
11188. up a threatening finger. "He is such a worthy and excellent man, our
11189. dear Vyazmitinov...."
11190. 
11191. Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the
11192. honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the
11193. influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and
11194. Helene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a
11195. suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing
11196. to do with Sergey Kuzmich--a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings.
11197. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much as they
11198. enjoyed their Rhine wine, saute, and ices, and however they avoided
11199. looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as they seemed
11200. of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the
11201. story about Sergey Kuzmich, the laughter, and the food were all a
11202. pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was directed
11203. to--Pierre and Helene. Prince Vasili mimicked the sobbing of Sergey
11204. Kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter, and
11205. while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said: "Yes... it's
11206. getting on, it will all be settled today." Anna Pavlovna threatened
11207. him on behalf of "our dear Vyazmitinov," and in her eyes, which, for an
11208. instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vasili read a congratulation on his
11209. future son-in-law and on his daughter's happiness. The old princess
11210. sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and
11211. glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh seemed to say: "Yes,
11212. there's nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine, my dear,
11213. now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly,
11214. provocatively happy." "And what nonsense all this is that I am saying!"
11215. thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces of the lovers.
11216. "That's happiness!"
11217. 
11218. Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that
11219. society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy
11220. and handsome young man and woman for one another. And this human feeling
11221. dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter.
11222. Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was
11223. evidently forced. Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at
11224. table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked
11225. at the beautiful Helene with her radiant face and at the red, broad, and
11226. happy though uneasy face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light of
11227. the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone.
11228. 
11229. Pierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and
11230. embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation.
11231. He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and
11232. then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot
11233. unexpectedly through his mind.
11234. 
11235. "So it is all finished!" he thought. "And how has it all happened? How
11236. quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself alone,
11237. but because of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They are all
11238. expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I
11239. cannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it will
11240. certainly happen!" thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling shoulders
11241. close to his eyes.
11242. 
11243. Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it
11244. awkward to attract everyone's attention and to be considered a lucky man
11245. and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris possessed
11246. of a Helen. "But no doubt it always is and must be so!" he consoled
11247. himself. "And besides, what have I done to bring it about? How did
11248. it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vasili. Then there was
11249. nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards with
11250. her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her. How did it begin,
11251. when did it all come about?" And here he was sitting by her side as her
11252. betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, her breathing, her
11253. movements, her beauty. Then it would suddenly seem to him that it was
11254. not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was why they
11255. all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration he would
11256. expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good fortune.
11257. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second
11258. time. But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was
11259. said.
11260. 
11261. "I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkonski," repeated Prince
11262. Vasili a third time. "How absent-minded you are, my dear fellow."
11263. 
11264. Prince Vasili smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at
11265. him and Helene. "Well, what of it, if you all know it?" thought Pierre.
11266. "What of it? It's the truth!" and he himself smiled his gentle childlike
11267. smile, and Helene smiled too.
11268. 
11269. "When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmutz?" repeated Prince
11270. Vasili, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute.
11271. 
11272. "How can one talk or think of such trifles?" thought Pierre.
11273. 
11274. "Yes, from Olmutz," he answered, with a sigh.
11275. 
11276. After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the
11277. drawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave
11278. of Helene. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important
11279. occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away,
11280. refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful
11281. silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity of his
11282. diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre's happiness. The old general
11283. grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. "Oh, the old fool,"
11284. he thought. "That Princess Helene will be beautiful still when she's
11285. fifty."
11286. 
11287. "I think I may congratulate you," whispered Anna Pavlovna to the old
11288. princess, kissing her soundly. "If I hadn't this headache I'd have
11289. stayed longer."
11290. 
11291. The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her
11292. daughter's happiness.
11293. 
11294. While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time
11295. alone with Helene in the little drawing room where they were sitting.
11296. He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her,
11297. but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable,
11298. but he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt
11299. ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone else's place here beside
11300. Helene. "This happiness is not for you," some inner voice whispered to
11301. him. "This happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in
11302. you."
11303. 
11304. But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was
11305. satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that
11306. this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.
11307. 
11308. Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in
11309. the large drawing room. Prince Vasili came up to Pierre with languid
11310. footsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince Vasili gave
11311. him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was
11312. so strange that one could not take it in. But then the expression of
11313. severity changed, and he drew Pierre's hand downwards, made him sit
11314. down, and smiled affectionately.
11315. 
11316. "Well, Lelya?" he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and
11317. addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to
11318. parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince
11319. Vasili had only acquired by imitating other parents.
11320. 
11321. And he again turned to Pierre.
11322. 
11323. "Sergey Kuzmich--From all sides-" he said, unbuttoning the top button of
11324. his waistcoat.
11325. 
11326. Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story
11327. about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince Vasili just then, and Prince
11328. Vasili saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered something and
11329. went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted.
11330. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched
11331. Pierre: he looked at Helene and she too seemed disconcerted, and her
11332. look seemed to say: "Well, it is your own fault."
11333. 
11334. "The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!" thought Pierre, and he
11335. again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergey Kuzmich,
11336. asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly.
11337. Helene answered with a smile that she too had missed it.
11338. 
11339. When Prince Vasili returned to the drawing room, the princess, his wife,
11340. was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.
11341. 
11342. "Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear..."
11343. 
11344. "Marriages are made in heaven," replied the elderly lady.
11345. 
11346. Prince Vasili passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down on
11347. a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to be
11348. dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.
11349. 
11350. "Aline," he said to his wife, "go and see what they are about."
11351. 
11352. The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and
11353. indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and
11354. Helene still sat talking just as before.
11355. 
11356. "Still the same," she said to her husband.
11357. 
11358. Prince Vasili frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his
11359. face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking
11360. himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went
11361. past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went
11362. joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre
11363. rose in alarm on seeing it.
11364. 
11365. "Thank God!" said Prince Vasili. "My wife has told me everything!" (He
11366. put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter.)--"My dear
11367. boy... Lelya... I am very pleased." (His voice trembled.) "I loved your
11368. father... and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!..."
11369. 
11370. He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his
11371. malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.
11372. 
11373. "Princess, come here!" he shouted.
11374. 
11375. The old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using
11376. her handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful
11377. Helene's hand several times. After a while they were left alone again.
11378. 
11379. "All this had to be and could not be otherwise," thought Pierre, "so
11380. it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because it's
11381. definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt." Pierre held the
11382. hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it
11383. rose and fell.
11384. 
11385. "Helene!" he said aloud and paused.
11386. 
11387. "Something special is always said in such cases," he thought, but could
11388. not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face. She
11389. drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.
11390. 
11391. "Oh, take those off... those..." she said, pointing to his spectacles.
11392. 
11393. Pierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have
11394. from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and
11395. inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but
11396. with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his
11397. lips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,
11398. unpleasantly excited expression.
11399. 
11400. "It is too late now, it's done; besides I love her," thought Pierre.
11401. 
11402. "Je vous aime!" * he said, remembering what has to be said at such
11403. moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.
11404. 
11405. 
11406.     * "I love you."
11407. 
11408. 
11409. Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezukhov's large,
11410. newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people said,
11411. of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money.
11412. 
11413. 
11414. 
11415. 
11416. 
11417. CHAPTER III
11418. 
11419. 
11420. Old Prince Nicholas Bolkonski received a letter from Prince Vasili in
11421. November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him a
11422. visit. "I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I shall
11423. think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same
11424. time, my honored benefactor," wrote Prince Vasili. "My son Anatole is
11425. accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will allow him
11426. personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his father, he
11427. feels for you."
11428. 
11429. "It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are
11430. coming to us of their own accord," incautiously remarked the little
11431. princess on hearing the news.
11432. 
11433. Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.
11434. 
11435. A fortnight after the letter Prince Vasili's servants came one evening
11436. in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.
11437. 
11438. Old Bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasili's
11439. character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and
11440. Alexander Prince Vasili had risen to high position and honors. And now,
11441. from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess,
11442. he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into
11443. a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned
11444. him. On the day of Prince Vasili's arrival, Prince Bolkonski was
11445. particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad
11446. temper because Prince Vasili was coming, or whether his being in a bad
11447. temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vasili's visit, he was in a
11448. bad temper, and in the morning Tikhon had already advised the architect
11449. not to go to the prince with his report.
11450. 
11451. "Do you hear how he's walking?" said Tikhon, drawing the architect's
11452. attention to the sound of the prince's footsteps. "Stepping flat on his
11453. heels--we know what that means...."
11454. 
11455. However, at nine o'clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable
11456. collar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day
11457. before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the
11458. habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still
11459. visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the
11460. soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince went
11461. through the conservatories, the serfs' quarters, and the outbuildings,
11462. frowning and silent.
11463. 
11464. "Can a sleigh pass?" he asked his overseer, a venerable man, resembling
11465. his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him back to the
11466. house.
11467. 
11468. "The snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor."
11469. 
11470. The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. "God be thanked,"
11471. thought the overseer, "the storm has blown over!"
11472. 
11473. "It would have been hard to drive up, your honor," he added. "I heard,
11474. your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor."
11475. 
11476. The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,
11477. frowning.
11478. 
11479. "What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?" he said in his
11480. shrill, harsh voice. "The road is not swept for the princess my
11481. daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!"
11482. 
11483. "Your honor, I thought..."
11484. 
11485. "You thought!" shouted the prince, his words coming more and more
11486. rapidly and indistinctly. "You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!... I'll
11487. teach you to think!" and lifting his stick he swung it and would have
11488. hit Alpatych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively avoided the
11489. blow. "Thought... Blackguards..." shouted the prince rapidly.
11490. 
11491. But although Alpatych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the
11492. stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before
11493. him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued to
11494. shout: "Blackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!" did not lift
11495. his stick again but hurried into the house.
11496. 
11497. Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew
11498. that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle
11499. Bourienne with a radiant face that said: "I know nothing, I am the same
11500. as usual," and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast eyes.
11501. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she
11502. ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not. She thought:
11503. "If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with
11504. him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will say (as he has
11505. done before) that I'm in the dumps."
11506. 
11507. The prince looked at his daughter's frightened face and snorted.
11508. 
11509. "Fool... or dummy!" he muttered.
11510. 
11511. "And the other one is not here. They've been telling tales," he
11512. thought--referring to the little princess who was not in the dining
11513. room.
11514. 
11515. "Where is the princess?" he asked. "Hiding?"
11516. 
11517. "She is not very well," answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a bright
11518. smile, "so she won't come down. It is natural in her state."
11519. 
11520. "Hm! Hm!" muttered the prince, sitting down.
11521. 
11522. His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he
11523. flung it away. Tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little
11524. princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince
11525. that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.
11526. 
11527. "I am afraid for the baby," she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne: "Heaven
11528. knows what a fright might do."
11529. 
11530. In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and
11531. with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not
11532. realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince
11533. reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt
11534. for her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald
11535. Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole
11536. days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her
11537. about the old prince and criticized him.
11538. 
11539. "So we are to have visitors, mon prince?" remarked Mademoiselle
11540. Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. "His
11541. Excellency Prince Vasili Kuragin and his son, I understand?" she said
11542. inquiringly.
11543. 
11544. "Hm!--his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the
11545. service," said the prince disdainfully. "Why his son is coming I don't
11546. understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know. I don't
11547. want him." (He looked at his blushing daughter.) "Are you unwell today?
11548. Eh? Afraid of the 'minister' as that idiot Alpatych called him this
11549. morning?"
11550. 
11551. "No, mon pere."
11552. 
11553. Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice
11554. of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the
11555. conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and
11556. after the soup the prince became more genial.
11557. 
11558. After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess
11559. was sitting at a small table, chattering with Masha, her maid. She grew
11560. pale on seeing her father-in-law.
11561. 
11562. She was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks
11563. had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.
11564. 
11565. "Yes, I feel a kind of oppression," she said in reply to the prince's
11566. question as to how she felt.
11567. 
11568. "Do you want anything?"
11569. 
11570. "No, merci, mon pere."
11571. 
11572. "Well, all right, all right."
11573. 
11574. He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych stood with
11575. bowed head.
11576. 
11577. "Has the snow been shoveled back?"
11578. 
11579. "Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven's sake... It was only my
11580. stupidity."
11581. 
11582. "All right, all right," interrupted the prince, and laughing his
11583. unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alpatych to kiss, and then
11584. proceeded to his study.
11585. 
11586. Prince Vasili arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by coachmen
11587. and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to one of the
11588. lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.
11589. 
11590. Prince Vasili and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.
11591. 
11592. Anatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a
11593. table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his
11594. large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round
11595. of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him.
11596. And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly
11597. heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well
11598. and amusingly. "And why not marry her if she really has so much money?
11599. That never does any harm," thought Anatole.
11600. 
11601. He shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had
11602. become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his
11603. father's room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to him.
11604. Prince Vasili's two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked round
11605. with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
11606. entered, as if to say: "Yes, that's how I want you to look."
11607. 
11608. "I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?" Anatole asked, as if
11609. continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned
11610. during the journey.
11611. 
11612. "Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious
11613. with the old prince."
11614. 
11615. "If he starts a row I'll go away," said Prince Anatole. "I can't bear
11616. those old men! Eh?"
11617. 
11618. "Remember, for you everything depends on this."
11619. 
11620. In the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants' rooms that
11621. the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had
11622. been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room,
11623. vainly trying to master her agitation.
11624. 
11625. "Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never
11626. happen!" she said, looking at herself in the glass. "How shall I enter
11627. the drawing room? Even if I like him I can't now be myself with him."
11628. The mere thought of her father's look filled her with terror. The little
11629. princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received from Masha,
11630. the lady's maid, the necessary report of how handsome the minister's son
11631. was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty
11632. the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him
11633. like an eagle, three steps at a time. Having received this information,
11634. the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose chattering voices
11635. had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess Mary's room.
11636. 
11637. "You know they've come, Marie?" said the little princess, waddling in,
11638. and sinking heavily into an armchair.
11639. 
11640. She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,
11641. but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her
11642. face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded
11643. outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still
11644. more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch
11645. had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne's toilet which rendered her
11646. fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.
11647. 
11648. "What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?" she began.
11649. "They'll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we
11650. shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!"
11651. 
11652. The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily
11653. began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be
11654. dressed. Princess Mary's self-esteem was wounded by the fact that
11655. the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both her
11656. companions' not having the least conception that it could be otherwise.
11657. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to
11658. betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to dress her would
11659. prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes
11660. grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattractive
11661. martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she submitted herself to
11662. Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these women quite sincerely tried
11663. to make her look pretty. She was so plain that neither of them could
11664. think of her as a rival, so they began dressing her with perfect
11665. sincerity, and with the naive and firm conviction women have that dress
11666. can make a face pretty.
11667. 
11668. "No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty," said Lise, looking
11669. sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. "You have a maroon
11670. dress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may
11671. be at stake. But this one is too light, it's not becoming!"
11672. 
11673. It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary
11674. that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little
11675. princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed
11676. in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on
11677. the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that
11678. the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that
11679. however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it
11680. would still remain piteous and plain. After two or three changes to
11681. which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged
11682. on the top of her head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her
11683. looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the
11684. little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the
11685. dress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her
11686. with her head bent first on one side and then on the other.
11687. 
11688. "No, it will not do," she said decidedly, clasping her hands. "No, Mary,
11689. really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little gray
11690. everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie," she said to the
11691. maid, "bring the princess her gray dress, and you'll see, Mademoiselle
11692. Bourienne, how I shall arrange it," she added, smiling with a foretaste
11693. of artistic pleasure.
11694. 
11695. But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained
11696. sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the
11697. mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst
11698. into sobs.
11699. 
11700. "Come, dear princess," said Mademoiselle Bourienne, "just one more
11701. little effort."
11702. 
11703. The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess
11704. Mary.
11705. 
11706. "Well, now we'll arrange something quite simple and becoming," she said.
11707. 
11708. The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne's, and Katie's, who was
11709. laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping of
11710. birds.
11711. 
11712. "No, leave me alone," said Princess Mary.
11713. 
11714. Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
11715. was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful
11716. eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at
11717. them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.
11718. 
11719. "At least, change your coiffure," said the little princess. "Didn't I
11720. tell you," she went on, turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne,
11721. "Mary's is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least. Not
11722. in the least! Please change it."
11723. 
11724. "Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to me,"
11725. answered a voice struggling with tears.
11726. 
11727. Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves
11728. that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual,
11729. but it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they
11730. both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess
11731. Mary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they
11732. knew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to
11733. be shaken in her determination.
11734. 
11735. "You will change it, won't you?" said Lise. And as Princess Mary gave no
11736. answer, she left the room.
11737. 
11738. Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise's request,
11739. she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her
11740. glass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and
11741. pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive
11742. being rose in her imagination, and carried her into a totally different
11743. happy world of his own. She fancied a child, her own--such as she had
11744. seen the day before in the arms of her nurse's daughter--at her own
11745. breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the
11746. child. "But no, it is impossible, I am too ugly," she thought.
11747. 
11748. "Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment," came the
11749. maid's voice at the door.
11750. 
11751. She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and
11752. before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her
11753. eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a
11754. lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful
11755. doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a
11756. man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of
11757. happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing
11758. was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from
11759. others and even from herself, the stronger it grew. "O God," she said,
11760. "how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil? How am I
11761. to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill
11762. Thy will?" And scarcely had she put that question than God gave her the
11763. answer in her own heart. "Desire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be
11764. not anxious or envious. Man's future and thy own fate must remain hidden
11765. from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it be
11766. God's will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill
11767. His will." With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the
11768. fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed,
11769. and having crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and
11770. coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say. What
11771. could all that matter in comparison with the will of God, without Whose
11772. care not a hair of man's head can fall?
11773. 
11774. 
11775. 
11776. 
11777. 
11778. CHAPTER IV
11779. 
11780. 
11781. When Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasili and his son were already
11782. in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle
11783. Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels,
11784. the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess,
11785. indicating her to the gentlemen, said: "Voila Marie!" Princess Mary saw
11786. them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vasili's face, serious
11787. for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and
11788. the little princess curiously noting the impression "Marie" produced on
11789. the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and
11790. pretty face, and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him,
11791. but him she could not see, she only saw something large, brilliant,
11792. and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room. Prince Vasili
11793. approached first, and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her
11794. hand and answered his question by saying that, on the contrary, she
11795. remembered him quite well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still could
11796. not see him. She only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she
11797. touched with her lips a white forehead, over which was beautiful
11798. light-brown hair smelling of pomade. When she looked up at him she was
11799. struck by his beauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button
11800. of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly
11801. swinging one foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with beaming
11802. face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about
11803. her at all. Anatole was not quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in
11804. conversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable in society, of
11805. composure and imperturbable self-possession. If a man lacking in
11806. self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a
11807. consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find
11808. something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his
11809. foot, and smilingly examined the princess' hair. It was evident that he
11810. could be silent in this way for a very long time. "If anyone finds this
11811. silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don't want to," he seemed to
11812. say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner
11813. which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even love--a
11814. supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as if he said
11815. to them: "I know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you?
11816. You'd be only too glad, of course." Perhaps he did not really think this
11817. when he met women--even probably he did not, for in general he thought
11818. very little--but his looks and manner gave that impression. The princess
11819. felt this, and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare
11820. expect to interest him, she turned to his father. The conversation was
11821. general and animated, thanks to Princess Lise's voice and little downy
11822. lip that lifted over her white teeth. She met Prince Vasili with that
11823. playful manner often employed by lively chatty people, and consisting
11824. in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves
11825. there are some semi-private, long-established jokes and amusing
11826. reminiscences, though no such reminiscences really exist--just as none
11827. existed in this case. Prince Vasili readily adopted her tone and the
11828. little princess also drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these
11829. amusing recollections of things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle
11830. Bourienne also shared them and even Princess Mary felt herself
11831. pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences.
11832. 
11833. "Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to
11834. ourselves, dear prince," said the little princess (of course, in French)
11835. to Prince Vasili. "It's not as at Annette's * receptions where you
11836. always ran away; you remember cette chere Annette!"
11837. 
11838. 
11839.     * Anna Pavlovna.
11840. 
11841. 
11842. "Ah, but you won't talk politics to me like Annette!"
11843. 
11844. "And our little tea table?"
11845. 
11846. "Oh, yes!"
11847. 
11848. "Why is it you were never at Annette's?" the little princess asked
11849. Anatole. "Ah, I know, I know," she said with a sly glance, "your brother
11850. Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!" and she shook her finger at
11851. him, "I have even heard of your doings in Paris!"
11852. 
11853. "And didn't Hippolyte tell you?" asked Prince Vasili, turning to his son
11854. and seizing the little princess' arm as if she would have run away and
11855. he had just managed to catch her, "didn't he tell you how he himself was
11856. pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? Oh, she
11857. is a pearl among women, Princess," he added, turning to Princess Mary.
11858. 
11859. When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the
11860. opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.
11861. 
11862. She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole
11863. had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the
11864. Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her
11865. about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole
11866. came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either.
11867. "Not at all bad!" he thought, examining her, "not at all bad, that
11868. little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we're
11869. married, la petite est gentille." *
11870. 
11871. 
11872.     * The little one is charming.
11873. 
11874. 
11875. The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering
11876. what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. "What are
11877. Prince Vasili and that son of his to me? Prince Vasili is a shallow
11878. braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen," he grumbled to
11879. himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived
11880. in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about
11881. which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever
11882. bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The
11883. prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand
11884. that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only
11885. with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without
11886. Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to
11887. him. "And why should she marry?" he thought. "To be unhappy for certain.
11888. There's Lise, married to Andrew--a better husband one would think could
11889. hardly be found nowadays--but is she contented with her lot? And who
11890. would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They'll take her for her
11891. connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even
11892. the happier for it?" So thought Prince Bolkonski while dressing, and
11893. yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate
11894. answer. Prince Vasili had brought his son with the evident intention of
11895. proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer.
11896. His birth and position in society were not bad. "Well, I've nothing
11897. against it," the prince said to himself, "but he must be worthy of her.
11898. And that is what we shall see."
11899. 
11900. "That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!" he added aloud.
11901. 
11902. He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly
11903. round the company. He noticed the change in the little princess' dress,
11904. Mademoiselle Bourienne's ribbon, Princess Mary's unbecoming coiffure,
11905. Mademoiselle Bourienne's and Anatole's smiles, and the loneliness of his
11906. daughter amid the general conversation. "Got herself up like a fool!"
11907. he thought, looking irritably at her. "She is shameless, and he ignores
11908. her!"
11909. 
11910. He went straight up to Prince Vasili.
11911. 
11912. "Well! How d'ye do? How d'ye do? Glad to see you!"
11913. 
11914. "Friendship laughs at distance," began Prince Vasili in his usual rapid,
11915. self-confident, familiar tone. "Here is my second son; please love and
11916. befriend him."
11917. 
11918. Prince Bolkonski surveyed Anatole.
11919. 
11920. "Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!" he said. "Well, come and kiss
11921. me," and he offered his cheek.
11922. 
11923. Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect
11924. composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had
11925. told him to expect.
11926. 
11927. Prince Bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa
11928. and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasili, pointed to it and began
11929. questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen
11930. attentively to what Prince Vasili said, but kept glancing at Princess
11931. Mary.
11932. 
11933. "And so they are writing from Potsdam already?" he said, repeating
11934. Prince Vasili's last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his
11935. daughter.
11936. 
11937. "Is it for visitors you've got yourself up like that, eh?" said he.
11938. "Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the
11939. visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are
11940. never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent."
11941. 
11942. "It was my fault, mon pere," interceded the little princess, with a
11943. blush.
11944. 
11945. "You must do as you please," said Prince Bolkonski, bowing to his
11946. daughter-in-law, "but she need not make a fool of herself, she's plain
11947. enough as it is."
11948. 
11949. And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was
11950. reduced to tears.
11951. 
11952. "On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well," said
11953. Prince Vasili.
11954. 
11955. "Now you, young prince, what's your name?" said Prince Bolkonski,
11956. turning to Anatole, "come here, let us talk and get acquainted."
11957. 
11958. "Now the fun begins," thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside
11959. the old prince.
11960. 
11961. "Well, my dear boy, I hear you've been educated abroad, not taught to
11962. read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me,
11963. my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?" asked the old man,
11964. scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.
11965. 
11966. "No, I have been transferred to the line," said Anatole, hardly able to
11967. restrain his laughter.
11968. 
11969. "Ah! That's a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar
11970. and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are
11971. you off to the front?"
11972. 
11973. "No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached...
11974. what is it I am attached to, Papa?" said Anatole, turning to his father
11975. with a laugh.
11976. 
11977. "A splendid soldier, splendid! 'What am I attached to!' Ha, ha, ha!"
11978. laughed Prince Bolkonski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly
11979. Prince Bolkonski frowned.
11980. 
11981. "You may go," he said to Anatole.
11982. 
11983. Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.
11984. 
11985. "And so you've had him educated abroad, Prince Vasili, haven't you?"
11986. said the old prince to Prince Vasili.
11987. 
11988. "I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there
11989. is much better than ours."
11990. 
11991. "Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad's
11992. a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now." He took Prince
11993. Vasili's arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were alone
11994. together, Prince Vasili announced his hopes and wishes to the old
11995. prince.
11996. 
11997. "Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can't part from her?"
11998. said the old prince angrily. "What an idea! I'm ready for it tomorrow!
11999. Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You know
12000. my principles--everything aboveboard? I will ask her tomorrow in your
12001. presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and I'll
12002. see." The old prince snorted. "Let her marry, it's all the same to me!"
12003. he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son.
12004. 
12005. "I will tell you frankly," said Prince Vasili in the tone of a crafty
12006. man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen-sighted
12007. companion. "You know, you see right through people. Anatole is no
12008. genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent son or
12009. kinsman."
12010. 
12011. "All right, all right, we'll see!"
12012. 
12013. As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time
12014. without male society, on Anatole's appearance all the three women of
12015. Prince Bolkonski's household felt that their life had not been real
12016. till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately
12017. increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in
12018. darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.
12019. 
12020. Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The
12021. handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed
12022. all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and
12023. magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future
12024. family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and
12025. tried to conceal them.
12026. 
12027. "But am I not too cold with him?" thought the princess. "I try to be
12028. reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already,
12029. but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do
12030. not like him."
12031. 
12032. And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new
12033. guest. "Poor girl, she's devilish ugly!" thought Anatole.
12034. 
12035. Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole's
12036. arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman
12037. without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did
12038. not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolkonski, to reading
12039. aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle
12040. Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to
12041. appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed,
12042. ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her
12043. off; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew
12044. a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she
12045. liked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl who had been
12046. seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre mere) appeared, and
12047. reproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle
12048. Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this
12049. story to him, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had
12050. appeared. He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appear
12051. and he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle
12052. Bourienne's head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about
12053. Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a
12054. moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar
12055. to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around
12056. him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.
12057. 
12058. The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,
12059. unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the
12060. familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any
12061. struggle, but with naive and lighthearted gaiety.
12062. 
12063. Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man
12064. tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the
12065. spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was
12066. beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne
12067. that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great
12068. suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.
12069. 
12070. After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was
12071. asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits,
12072. came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle
12073. Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.
12074. Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the
12075. look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But Anatole's
12076. expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but
12077. to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne's little foot, which he was
12078. then touching with his own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne
12079. was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a
12080. look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.
12081. 
12082. "How she loves me!" thought Princess Mary. "How happy I am now, and how
12083. happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband? Can it
12084. be possible?" she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still
12085. feeling his eyes gazing at her.
12086. 
12087. In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole
12088. kissed Princess Mary's hand. She did not know how she found the courage,
12089. but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her
12090. shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed
12091. Mademoiselle Bourienne's hand. (This was not etiquette, but then he did
12092. everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne
12093. flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.
12094. 
12095. "What delicacy!" thought the princess. "Is it possible that Amelie"
12096. (Mademoiselle Bourienne) "thinks I could be jealous of her, and not
12097. value her pure affection and devotion to me?" She went up to her and
12098. kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess' hand.
12099. 
12100. "No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
12101. well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!" she said. And
12102. smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.
12103. 
12104. 
12105. 
12106. 
12107. 
12108. CHAPTER V
12109. 
12110. 
12111. They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he
12112. got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.
12113. 
12114. "Is he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind--yes, kind,
12115. that is the chief thing," thought Princess Mary; and fear, which she had
12116. seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it seemed
12117. to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark
12118. corner. And this someone was he--the devil--and he was also this man
12119. with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.
12120. 
12121. She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.
12122. 
12123. Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long
12124. time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now
12125. working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mere
12126. rebuking her for her fall.
12127. 
12128. The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made.
12129. She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was
12130. awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than
12131. ever because Anatole's presence had vividly recalled to her the time
12132. when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She
12133. sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy
12134. and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third
12135. time, muttering to herself.
12136. 
12137. "I told you it was all lumps and holes!" the little princess repeated.
12138. "I should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it's not my fault!" and her
12139. voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.
12140. 
12141. The old prince did not sleep either. Tikhon, half asleep, heard him
12142. pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he
12143. had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed
12144. because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he
12145. loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider
12146. the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but
12147. instead of that he only excited himself more and more.
12148. 
12149. "The first man that turns up--she forgets her father and everything
12150. else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike
12151. herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice
12152. it. Fr... fr... fr! And don't I see that that idiot had eyes only for
12153. Bourienne--I shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not
12154. pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at
12155. least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks
12156. nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but
12157. I'll let her see...."
12158. 
12159. The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a
12160. mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne,
12161. Princess Mary's self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to
12162. be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this
12163. thought, he called Tikhon and began to undress.
12164. 
12165. "What devil brought them here?" thought he, while Tikhon was putting the
12166. nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest. "I never
12167. invited them. They came to disturb my life--and there is not much of it
12168. left."
12169. 
12170. "Devil take 'em!" he muttered, while his head was still covered by the
12171. shirt.
12172. 
12173. Tikhon knew his master's habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and
12174. therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of
12175. the face that emerged from the shirt.
12176. 
12177. "Gone to bed?" asked the prince.
12178. 
12179. Tikhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his
12180. master's thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince
12181. Vasili and his son.
12182. 
12183. "They have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency."
12184. 
12185. "No good... no good..." said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet
12186. into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, he
12187. went to the couch on which he slept.
12188. 
12189. Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne,
12190. they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance,
12191. up to the appearance of the pauvre mere; they understood that they had
12192. much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an
12193. opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary
12194. went to her father's room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and
12195. Anatole met in the conservatory.
12196. 
12197. Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation.
12198. It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be
12199. decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it.
12200. She read this in Tikhon's face and in that of Prince Vasili's valet, who
12201. made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water.
12202. 
12203. The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of
12204. his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking
12205. expression of her father's. His face wore that expression when his
12206. dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in
12207. arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her,
12208. repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.
12209. 
12210. He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.
12211. 
12212. "I have had a proposition made me concerning you," he said with an
12213. unnatural smile. "I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasili has not
12214. come and brought his pupil with him" (for some reason Prince Bolkonski
12215. referred to Anatole as a "pupil") "for the sake of my beautiful eyes.
12216. Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you know my
12217. principles, I refer it to you."
12218. 
12219. "How am I to understand you, mon pere?" said the princess, growing pale
12220. and then blushing.
12221. 
12222. "How understand me!" cried her father angrily. "Prince Vasili finds you
12223. to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you on his
12224. pupil's behalf. That's how it's to be understood! 'How understand
12225. it'!... And I ask you!"
12226. 
12227. "I do not know what you think, Father," whispered the princess.
12228. 
12229. "I? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. I'm not going to get
12230. married. What about you? That's what I want to know."
12231. 
12232. The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval,
12233. but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be
12234. decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze
12235. under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to
12236. submit from habit, and she said: "I wish only to do your will, but if
12237. I had to express my own desire..." She had no time to finish. The old
12238. prince interrupted her.
12239. 
12240. "That's admirable!" he shouted. "He will take you with your dowry and
12241. take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. She'll be the wife, while
12242. you..."
12243. 
12244. The prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his
12245. daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.
12246. 
12247. "Now then, now then, I'm only joking!" he said. "Remember this,
12248. Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to
12249. choose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your life's happiness
12250. depends on your decision. Never mind me!"
12251. 
12252. "But I do not know, Father!"
12253. 
12254. "There's no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you or
12255. anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it over,
12256. and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no. I know
12257. you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better think
12258. it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!" he still shouted when the
12259. princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the study.
12260. 
12261. Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said
12262. about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but
12263. still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was
12264. going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing
12265. anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle
12266. Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw
12267. Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With
12268. a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess
12269. Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle
12270. Bourienne who had not yet seen her.
12271. 
12272. "Who's that? Why? Wait a moment!" Anatole's face seemed to say. Princess
12273. Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At last
12274. Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to
12275. Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at
12276. this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door
12277. that led to his own apartments.
12278. 
12279. An hour later, Tikhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince;
12280. he added that Prince Vasili was also there. When Tikhon came to her
12281. Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping
12282. Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The
12283. princess' beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were
12284. looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienne's
12285. pretty face.
12286. 
12287. "No, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!" said Mademoiselle
12288. Bourienne.
12289. 
12290. "Why? I love you more than ever," said Princess Mary, "and I will try to
12291. do all I can for your happiness."
12292. 
12293. "But you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so
12294. carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother..."
12295. 
12296. "I quite understand," answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile. "Calm
12297. yourself, my dear. I will go to my father," she said, and went out.
12298. 
12299. Prince Vasili, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in
12300. his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face,
12301. as if stirred to his heart's core and himself regretting and laughing
12302. at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a
12303. pinch of snuff.
12304. 
12305. "Ah, my dear, my dear!" he began, rising and taking her by both hands.
12306. Then, sighing, he added: "My son's fate is in your hands. Decide, my
12307. dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a daughter!"
12308. 
12309. He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.
12310. 
12311. "Fr... fr..." snorted Prince Bolkonski. "The prince is making a
12312. proposition to you in his pupil's--I mean, his son's--name. Do you
12313. wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kuragin's wife? Reply: yes or no," he
12314. shouted, "and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also.
12315. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion," added Prince Bolkonski, turning
12316. to Prince Vasili and answering his imploring look. "Yes, or no?"
12317. 
12318. "My desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my life
12319. from yours. I don't wish to marry," she answered positively, glancing at
12320. Prince Vasili and at her father with her beautiful eyes.
12321. 
12322. "Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!" cried Prince Bolkonski,
12323. frowning and taking his daughter's hand; he did not kiss her, but only
12324. bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so
12325. that she winced and uttered a cry.
12326. 
12327. Prince Vasili rose.
12328. 
12329. "My dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never
12330. forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching
12331. this heart, so kind and generous? Say 'perhaps'... The future is so
12332. long. Say 'perhaps.'"
12333. 
12334. "Prince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for
12335. the honor, but I shall never be your son's wife."
12336. 
12337. "Well, so that's finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have seen
12338. you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!" said the old
12339. prince. "Very, very glad to have seen you," repeated he, embracing
12340. Prince Vasili.
12341. 
12342. "My vocation is a different one," thought Princess Mary. "My vocation
12343. is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness of love
12344. and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange poor Amelie's
12345. happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so passionately repents. I
12346. will do all I can to arrange the match between them. If he is not rich I
12347. will give her the means; I will ask my father and Andrew. I shall be so
12348. happy when she is his wife. She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone,
12349. helpless! And, oh God, how passionately she must love him if she could
12350. so far forget herself! Perhaps I might have done the same!..." thought
12351. Princess Mary.
12352. 
12353. 
12354. 
12355. 
12356. 
12357. CHAPTER VI
12358. 
12359. 
12360. It was long since the Rostovs had news of Nicholas. Not till
12361. midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son's
12362. handwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and
12363. haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the
12364. letter.
12365. 
12366. Anna Mikhaylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house,
12367. on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and
12368. found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same
12369. time.
12370. 
12371. Anna Mikhaylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still
12372. living with the Rostovs.
12373. 
12374. "My dear friend?" said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared to
12375. sympathize in any way.
12376. 
12377. The count sobbed yet more.
12378. 
12379. "Nikolenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling boy...
12380. the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How tell the
12381. little countess!"
12382. 
12383. Anna Mikhaylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped
12384. the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her
12385. own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till
12386. teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God's help,
12387. would inform her.
12388. 
12389. At dinner Anna Mikhaylovna talked the whole time about the war news and
12390. about Nikolenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received from
12391. him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might very
12392. likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these hints
12393. began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the
12394. count and at Anna Mikhaylovna, the latter very adroitly turned the
12395. conversation to insignificant matters. Natasha, who, of the whole
12396. family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of
12397. intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning
12398. of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her
12399. father and Anna Mikhaylovna, that it had something to do with her
12400. brother, and that Anna Mikhaylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as
12401. she was, Natasha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything
12402. relating to Nikolenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner,
12403. but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her
12404. chair regardless of her governess' remarks. After dinner, she rushed
12405. head long after Anna Mikhaylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on
12406. her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.
12407. 
12408. "Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!"
12409. 
12410. "Nothing, my dear."
12411. 
12412. "No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won't give up--I know you know
12413. something."
12414. 
12415. Anna Mikhaylovna shook her head.
12416. 
12417. "You are a little slyboots," she said.
12418. 
12419. "A letter from Nikolenka! I'm sure of it!" exclaimed Natasha, reading
12420. confirmation in Anna Mikhaylovna's face.
12421. 
12422. "But for God's sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your mamma."
12423. 
12424. "I will, I will, only tell me! You won't? Then I will go and tell at
12425. once."
12426. 
12427. Anna Mikhaylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter,
12428. on condition that she should tell no one.
12429. 
12430. "No, on my true word of honor," said Natasha, crossing herself, "I won't
12431. tell anyone!" and she ran off at once to Sonya.
12432. 
12433. "Nikolenka... wounded... a letter," she announced in gleeful triumph.
12434. 
12435. "Nicholas!" was all Sonya said, instantly turning white.
12436. 
12437. Natasha, seeing the impression the news of her brother's wound produced
12438. on Sonya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news.
12439. 
12440. She rushed to Sonya, hugged her, and began to cry.
12441. 
12442. "A little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he
12443. wrote himself," said she through her tears.
12444. 
12445. "There now! It's true that all you women are crybabies," remarked Petya,
12446. pacing the room with large, resolute strides. "Now I'm very glad, very
12447. glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so. You are all
12448. blubberers and understand nothing."
12449. 
12450. Natasha smiled through her tears.
12451. 
12452. "You haven't read the letter?" asked Sonya.
12453. 
12454. "No, but she said that it was all over and that he's now an officer."
12455. 
12456. "Thank God!" said Sonya, crossing herself. "But perhaps she deceived
12457. you. Let us go to Mamma."
12458. 
12459. Petya paced the room in silence for a time.
12460. 
12461. "If I'd been in Nikolenka's place I would have killed even more of those
12462. Frenchmen," he said. "What nasty brutes they are! I'd have killed so
12463. many that there'd have been a heap of them."
12464. 
12465. "Hold your tongue, Petya, what a goose you are!"
12466. 
12467. "I'm not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles," said Petya.
12468. 
12469. "Do you remember him?" Natasha suddenly asked, after a moment's silence.
12470. 
12471. Sonya smiled.
12472. 
12473. "Do I remember Nicholas?"
12474. 
12475. "No, Sonya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly,
12476. remember everything?" said Natasha, with an expressive gesture,
12477. evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning. "I remember
12478. Nikolenka too, I remember him well," she said. "But I don't remember
12479. Boris. I don't remember him a bit."
12480. 
12481. "What! You don't remember Boris?" asked Sonya in surprise.
12482. 
12483. "It's not that I don't remember--I know what he is like, but not as I
12484. remember Nikolenka. Him--I just shut my eyes and remember, but Boris...
12485. No!" (She shut her eyes.) "No! there's nothing at all."
12486. 
12487. "Oh, Natasha!" said Sonya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at her
12488. friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to
12489. say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking was
12490. out of the question, "I am in love with your brother once for all and,
12491. whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him as
12492. long as I live."
12493. 
12494. Natasha looked at Sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said
12495. nothing. She felt that Sonya was speaking the truth, that there was such
12496. love as Sonya was speaking of. But Natasha had not yet felt anything
12497. like it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.
12498. 
12499. "Shall you write to him?" she asked.
12500. 
12501. Sonya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to Nicholas, and
12502. whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an
12503. officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself
12504. and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on
12505. himself?
12506. 
12507. "I don't know. I think if he writes, I will write too," she said,
12508. blushing.
12509. 
12510. "And you won't feel ashamed to write to him?"
12511. 
12512. Sonya smiled.
12513. 
12514. "No."
12515. 
12516. "And I should be ashamed to write to Boris. I'm not going to."
12517. 
12518. "Why should you be ashamed?"
12519. 
12520. "Well, I don't know. It's awkward and would make me ashamed."
12521. 
12522. "And I know why she'd be ashamed," said Petya, offended by Natasha's
12523. previous remark. "It's because she was in love with that fat one in
12524. spectacles" (that was how Petya described his namesake, the new Count
12525. Bezukhov) "and now she's in love with that singer" (he meant Natasha's
12526. Italian singing master), "that's why she's ashamed!"
12527. 
12528. "Petya, you're a stupid!" said Natasha.
12529. 
12530. "Not more stupid than you, madam," said the nine-year-old Petya, with
12531. the air of an old brigadier.
12532. 
12533. The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikhaylovna's hints at dinner.
12534. On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a
12535. miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears
12536. kept coming into her eyes. Anna Mikhaylovna, with the letter, came on
12537. tiptoe to the countess' door and paused.
12538. 
12539. "Don't come in," she said to the old count who was following her. "Come
12540. later." And she went in, closing the door behind her.
12541. 
12542. The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.
12543. 
12544. At first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna
12545. Mikhaylovna's voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence,
12546. then both voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps.
12547. Anna Mikhaylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud expression of
12548. a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the
12549. public to appreciate his skill.
12550. 
12551. "It is done!" she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the
12552. countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and
12553. in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.
12554. 
12555. When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his
12556. bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait,
12557. and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away
12558. the bald head. Vera, Natasha, Sonya, and Petya now entered the room,
12559. and the reading of the letter began. After a brief description of
12560. the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his
12561. promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his father's and mother's hands
12562. asking for their blessing, and that he kissed Vera, Natasha, and Petya.
12563. Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss,
12564. and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him "dear Sonya, whom he
12565. loved and thought of just the same as ever." When she heard this Sonya
12566. blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable to bear the looks
12567. turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall, whirled round it at
12568. full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon, and, flushed and
12569. smiling, plumped down on the floor. The countess was crying.
12570. 
12571. "Why are you crying, Mamma?" asked Vera. "From all he says one should be
12572. glad and not cry."
12573. 
12574. This was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Natasha looked
12575. at her reproachfully. "And who is it she takes after?" thought the
12576. countess.
12577. 
12578. Nicholas' letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were
12579. considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she
12580. did not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses, and
12581. Dmitri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter
12582. each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh
12583. proofs of Nikolenka's virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how
12584. joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose
12585. tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom
12586. she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who had
12587. first learned to say "pear" and then "granny," that this son should now
12588. be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly warrior
12589. doing some kind of man's work of his own, without help or guidance.
12590. The universal experience of ages, showing that children do grow
12591. imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the
12592. countess. Her son's growth toward manhood, at each of its stages,
12593. had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the
12594. millions of human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty
12595. years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived
12596. somewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to
12597. speak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be
12598. this strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this
12599. letter, he now was.
12600. 
12601. "What a style! How charmingly he describes!" said she, reading the
12602. descriptive part of the letter. "And what a soul! Not a word about
12603. himself.... Not a word! About some Denisov or other, though he himself,
12604. I dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about his
12605. sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered
12606. everybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was only so
12607. high--I always said...."
12608. 
12609. For more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of
12610. letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out,
12611. while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the
12612. count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment
12613. of the newly commissioned officer were collected. Anna Mikhaylovna,
12614. practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army
12615. authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself
12616. and her son. She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand
12617. Duke Constantine Pavlovich, who commanded the Guards. The Rostovs
12618. supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address,
12619. and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards
12620. there was no reason why it should not reach the Pavlograd regiment,
12621. which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood. And so it was
12622. decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke's courier to
12623. Boris and Boris was to forward them to Nicholas. The letters were
12624. from the old count, the countess, Petya, Vera, Natasha, and Sonya, and
12625. finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other
12626. things the old count sent to his son.
12627. 
12628. 
12629. 
12630. 
12631. 
12632. CHAPTER VII
12633. 
12634. 
12635. On the twelfth of November, Kutuzov's active army, in camp before
12636. Olmutz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors--the
12637. Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent
12638. the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come straight
12639. to the review, reaching the field at Olmutz by ten o'clock.
12640. 
12641. That day Nicholas Rostov received a letter from Boris, telling him that
12642. the Ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmutz
12643. and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him.
12644. Rostov was particularly in need of money now that the troops, after
12645. their active service, were stationed near Olmutz and the camp swarmed
12646. with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts
12647. of tempting wares. The Pavlograds held feast after feast, celebrating
12648. awards they had received for the campaign, and made expeditions to
12649. Olmutz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian, who had recently
12650. opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses. Rostov, who had
12651. just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought Denisov's horse,
12652. Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and the sutlers. On
12653. receiving Boris' letter he rode with a fellow officer to Olmutz, dined
12654. there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone to the Guards'
12655. camp to find his old playmate. Rostov had not yet had time to get his
12656. uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with a soldier's
12657. cross, equally shabby cadet's riding breeches lined with worn leather,
12658. and an officer's saber with a sword knot. The Don horse he was riding
12659. was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign, and he wore a
12660. crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head. As he
12661. rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Boris and all his
12662. comrades of the Guards by his appearance--that of a fighting hussar who
12663. had been under fire.
12664. 
12665. The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading
12666. their cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy stages, their
12667. knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided
12668. excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place. The regiments
12669. had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand
12670. Duke's orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on
12671. which the Guards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their
12672. proper posts. Boris had been quartered, and had marched all the way,
12673. with Berg who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had
12674. obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of
12675. his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money
12676. matters very satisfactorily. Boris, during the campaign, had made the
12677. acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by
12678. a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become
12679. acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolkonski, through whom he hoped to obtain
12680. a post on the commander in chief's staff. Berg and Boris, having rested
12681. after yesterday's march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a
12682. round table in the clean quarters allotted to them, playing chess.
12683. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. Boris, in the accurate way
12684. characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of chessmen with
12685. his delicate white fingers while awaiting Berg's move, and watched his
12686. opponent's face, evidently thinking about the game as he always thought
12687. only of whatever he was engaged on.
12688. 
12689. "Well, how are you going to get out of that?" he remarked.
12690. 
12691. "We'll try to," replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing his
12692. hand.
12693. 
12694. At that moment the door opened.
12695. 
12696. "Here he is at last!" shouted Rostov. "And Berg too! Oh, you
12697. petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!" he exclaimed, imitating his Russian
12698. nurse's French, at which he and Boris used to laugh long ago.
12699. 
12700. "Dear me, how you have changed!"
12701. 
12702. Boris rose to meet Rostov, but in doing so did not omit to steady and
12703. replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his
12704. friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth,
12705. that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner
12706. different from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas
12707. wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch
12708. him, push him, do anything but kiss him--a thing everybody did. But
12709. notwithstanding this, Boris embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and
12710. kissed him three times.
12711. 
12712. They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young
12713. men take their first steps on life's road, each saw immense changes in
12714. the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken
12715. those first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both
12716. were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.
12717. 
12718. "Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you'd been to a fete,
12719. not like us sinners of the line," cried Rostov, with martial swagger
12720. and with baritone notes in his voice, new to Boris, pointing to his own
12721. mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Rostov's loud
12722. voice, popped her head in at the door.
12723. 
12724. "Eh, is she pretty?" he asked with a wink.
12725. 
12726. "Why do you shout so? You'll frighten them!" said Boris. "I did not
12727. expect you today," he added. "I only sent you the note yesterday by
12728. Bolkonski--an adjutant of Kutuzov's, who's a friend of mine. I did not
12729. think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you? Been
12730. under fire already?" asked Boris.
12731. 
12732. Without answering, Rostov shook the soldier's Cross of St. George
12733. fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm,
12734. glanced at Berg with a smile.
12735. 
12736. "As you see," he said.
12737. 
12738. "Indeed? Yes, yes!" said Boris, with a smile. "And we too have had a
12739. splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode
12740. with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every
12741. advantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls!
12742. I can't tell you. And the Tsarevich was very gracious to all our
12743. officers."
12744. 
12745. And the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his
12746. hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures
12747. and advantages of service under members of the Imperial family.
12748. 
12749. "Oh, you Guards!" said Rostov. "I say, send for some wine."
12750. 
12751. Boris made a grimace.
12752. 
12753. "If you really want it," said he.
12754. 
12755. He went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent
12756. for wine.
12757. 
12758. "Yes, and I have some money and a letter to give you," he added.
12759. 
12760. Rostov took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both
12761. arms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he
12762. glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the
12763. letter.
12764. 
12765. "Well, they've sent you a tidy sum," said Berg, eying the heavy purse
12766. that sank into the sofa. "As for us, Count, we get along on our pay. I
12767. can tell you for myself..."
12768. 
12769. "I say, Berg, my dear fellow," said Rostov, "when you get a letter from
12770. home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything
12771. over with, and I happen to be there, I'll go at once, to be out of
12772. your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!" he exclaimed, and
12773. immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his
12774. face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added,
12775. "Don't be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from my heart as to an
12776. old acquaintance."
12777. 
12778. "Oh, don't mention it, Count! I quite understand," said Berg, getting up
12779. and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.
12780. 
12781. "Go across to our hosts: they invited you," added Boris.
12782. 
12783. Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust,
12784. stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples
12785. upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having
12786. assured himself from the way Rostov looked at it that his coat had been
12787. noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.
12788. 
12789. "Oh dear, what a beast I am!" muttered Rostov, as he read the letter.
12790. 
12791. "Why?"
12792. 
12793. "Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them such
12794. a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!" he repeated, flushing suddenly. "Well,
12795. have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right let's have some!"
12796. 
12797. In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation
12798. to Bagration which the old countess at Anna Mikhaylovna's advice had
12799. obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take
12800. it to its destination and make use of it.
12801. 
12802. "What nonsense! Much I need it!" said Rostov, throwing the letter under
12803. the table.
12804. 
12805. "Why have you thrown that away?" asked Boris.
12806. 
12807. "It is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it
12808. for!"
12809. 
12810. "Why 'What the devil'?" said Boris, picking it up and reading the
12811. address. "This letter would be of great use to you."
12812. 
12813. "I want nothing, and I won't be anyone's adjutant."
12814. 
12815. "Why not?" inquired Boris.
12816. 
12817. "It's a lackey's job!"
12818. 
12819. "You are still the same dreamer, I see," remarked Boris, shaking his
12820. head.
12821. 
12822. "And you're still the same diplomatist! But that's not the point...
12823. Come, how are you?" asked Rostov.
12824. 
12825. "Well, as you see. So far everything's all right, but I confess I should
12826. much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front."
12827. 
12828. "Why?"
12829. 
12830. "Because when once a man starts on military service, he should try to
12831. make as successful a career of it as possible."
12832. 
12833. "Oh, that's it!" said Rostov, evidently thinking of something else.
12834. 
12835. He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes, evidently
12836. trying in vain to find the answer to some question.
12837. 
12838. Old Gabriel brought in the wine.
12839. 
12840. "Shouldn't we now send for Berg?" asked Boris. "He would drink with you.
12841. I can't."
12842. 
12843. "Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?" asked
12844. Rostov, with a contemptuous smile.
12845. 
12846. "He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow," answered Boris.
12847. 
12848. Again Rostov looked intently into Boris' eyes and sighed. Berg returned,
12849. and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers
12850. became animated. The Guardsmen told Rostov of their march and how they
12851. had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke of the
12852. sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told stories
12853. of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent when the
12854. subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the stories
12855. of the Grand Duke's quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he
12856. had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of
12857. the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement. With a
12858. pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in
12859. a violent passion, shouting: "Arnauts!" ("Arnauts" was the Tsarevich's
12860. favorite expression when he was in a rage) and called for the company
12861. commander.
12862. 
12863. "Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew
12864. I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army
12865. Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord's
12866. Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and so
12867. my conscience was at ease. I came forward...." (Berg stood up and showed
12868. how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really it
12869. would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and
12870. self-complacency than his did.) "Well, he stormed at me, as the saying
12871. is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but
12872. rather of death, as the saying is. 'Albanians!' and 'devils!' and 'To
12873. Siberia!'" said Berg with a sagacious smile. "I knew I was in the right
12874. so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?... 'Hey, are you dumb?' he
12875. shouted. Still I remained silent. And what do you think, Count? The
12876. next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of the Day. That's what
12877. keeping one's head means. That's the way, Count," said Berg, lighting
12878. his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.
12879. 
12880. "Yes, that was fine," said Rostov, smiling.
12881. 
12882. But Boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and
12883. skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where
12884. he got his wound. This pleased Rostov and he began talking about it, and
12885. as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his Schon
12886. Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle generally
12887. do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been, as they
12888. have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not at all as
12889. it really was. Rostov was a truthful young man and would on no
12890. account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to tell
12891. everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and
12892. inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his
12893. hearers--who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had
12894. formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear
12895. just such a story--they would either not have believed him or, still
12896. worse, would have thought that Rostov was himself to blame since what
12897. generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened
12898. to him. He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and
12899. that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as
12900. he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as
12901. it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of
12902. will to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth,
12903. and young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story
12904. of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like
12905. a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his
12906. saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he
12907. told them all that.
12908. 
12909. In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: "You cannot imagine
12910. what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack," Prince Andrew,
12911. whom Boris was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who liked
12912. to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and
12913. being well disposed toward Boris, who had managed to please him the day
12914. before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent with
12915. papers from Kutuzov to the Tsarevich, he looked in on Boris, hoping to
12916. find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting
12917. his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man),
12918. he gave Boris a pleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes he
12919. looked at Rostov, bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly
12920. on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company.
12921. Rostov flushed up on noticing this, but he did not care, this was a mere
12922. stranger. Glancing, however, at Boris, he saw that he too seemed ashamed
12923. of the hussar of the line.
12924. 
12925. In spite of Prince Andrew's disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of
12926. the contempt with which Rostov, from his fighting army point of view,
12927. regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer
12928. was evidently one, Rostov felt confused, blushed, and became silent.
12929. Boris inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without
12930. indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.
12931. 
12932. "We shall probably advance," replied Bolkonski, evidently reluctant to
12933. say more in the presence of a stranger.
12934. 
12935. Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was
12936. rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be
12937. doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could
12938. give no opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed
12939. gaily.
12940. 
12941. "As to your business," Prince Andrew continued, addressing Boris, "we
12942. will talk of it later" (and he looked round at Rostov). "Come to me
12943. after the review and we will do what is possible."
12944. 
12945. And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to Rostov,
12946. whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to
12947. anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: "I think you were
12948. talking of the Schon Grabern affair? Were you there?"
12949. 
12950. "I was there," said Rostov angrily, as if intending to insult the
12951. aide-de-camp.
12952. 
12953. Bolkonski noticed the hussar's state of mind, and it amused him. With a
12954. slightly contemptuous smile, he said: "Yes, there are many stories now
12955. told about that affair!"
12956. 
12957. "Yes, stories!" repeated Rostov loudly, looking with eyes suddenly grown
12958. furious, now at Boris, now at Bolkonski. "Yes, many stories! But our
12959. stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire! Our
12960. stories have some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the
12961. staff who get rewards without doing anything!"
12962. 
12963. "Of whom you imagine me to be one?" said Prince Andrew, with a quiet and
12964. particularly amiable smile.
12965. 
12966. A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man's
12967. self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostov's soul.
12968. 
12969. "I am not talking about you," he said, "I don't know you and, frankly, I
12970. don't want to. I am speaking of the staff in general."
12971. 
12972. "And I will tell you this," Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet
12973. authority, "you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with you that
12974. it would be very easy to do so if you haven't sufficient self-respect,
12975. but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen. In a day or two
12976. we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and
12977. besides, Drubetskoy, who says he is an old friend of yours, is not at
12978. all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you. However,"
12979. he added rising, "you know my name and where to find me, but don't
12980. forget that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all
12981. insulted, and as a man older than you, my advice is to let the matter
12982. drop. Well then, on Friday after the review I shall expect you,
12983. Drubetskoy. Au revoir!" exclaimed Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them
12984. both he went out.
12985. 
12986. Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostov think of what he ought to
12987. have said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it. He
12988. ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Boris, rode
12989. home. Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected
12990. adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question that worried
12991. him all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at
12992. seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by
12993. his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew
12994. there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very
12995. adjutant whom he so hated.
12996. 
12997. 
12998. 
12999. 
13000. 
13001. CHAPTER VIII
13002. 
13003. 
13004. The day after Rostov had been to see Boris, a review was held of the
13005. Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia
13006. and those who had been campaigning under Kutuzov. The two Emperors, the
13007. Russian with his heir the Tsarevich, and the Austrian with the Archduke,
13008. inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.
13009. 
13010. From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up
13011. on the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets
13012. moved and halted at the officers' command, turned with banners flying,
13013. formed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of
13014. infantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of
13015. hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided
13016. uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan,
13017. or gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the
13018. polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with
13019. the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the
13020. infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the
13021. generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn
13022. in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and
13023. wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded
13024. officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and
13025. his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed
13026. till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay
13027. smooth--felt that no small matter was happening, but an important and
13028. solemn affair. Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own
13029. insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and
13030. yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that
13031. enormous whole.
13032. 
13033. From early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten
13034. o'clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were drawn up on
13035. the vast field. The whole army was extended in three lines: the cavalry
13036. in front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the infantry.
13037. 
13038. A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The
13039. three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutuzov's fighting
13040. army (with the Pavlograds on the right flank of the front); those
13041. recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the line;
13042. and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines, under one
13043. command, and in a like order.
13044. 
13045. Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: "They're coming! They're
13046. coming!" Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final preparation
13047. swept over all the troops.
13048. 
13049. From the direction of Olmutz in front of them, a group was seen
13050. approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust
13051. of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the
13052. lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It
13053. looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its
13054. joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting: "Eyes
13055. front!" Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was repeated by
13056. others from various sides and all became silent.
13057. 
13058. In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This
13059. was the Emperors' suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the
13060. trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march. It
13061. seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army
13062. itself, rejoicing at the Emperors' approach, had naturally burst into
13063. music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor
13064. Alexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the
13065. first regiment roared "Hurrah!" so deafeningly, continuously, and
13066. joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the
13067. immensity of the power they constituted.
13068. 
13069. Rostov, standing in the front lines of Kutuzov's army which the Tsar
13070. approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in
13071. that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of
13072. might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this
13073. triumph.
13074. 
13075. He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he
13076. himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water,
13077. commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could
13078. not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.
13079. 
13080. "Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!" thundered from all sides, one regiment after
13081. another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then
13082. "Hurrah!"... Then the general march, and again "Hurrah! Hurrah!" growing
13083. ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.
13084. 
13085. Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility
13086. seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive,
13087. its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had
13088. already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices,
13089. amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to
13090. stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but
13091. symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two men--the
13092. Emperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that
13093. whole mass of men was concentrated.
13094. 
13095. The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse
13096. Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his
13097. pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone's
13098. attention.
13099. 
13100. Rostov was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had
13101. recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty
13102. paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his
13103. handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling tenderness and
13104. ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every
13105. movement of the Tsar's seemed to him enchanting.
13106. 
13107. Stopping in front of the Pavlograds, the Tsar said something in French
13108. to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.
13109. 
13110. Seeing that smile, Rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still
13111. stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in
13112. some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar
13113. called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.
13114. 
13115. "Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?" thought
13116. Rostov. "I should die of happiness!"
13117. 
13118. The Tsar addressed the officers also: "I thank you all, gentlemen, I
13119. thank you with my whole heart." To Rostov every word sounded like a
13120. voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!
13121. 
13122. "You have earned the St. George's standards and will be worthy of them."
13123. 
13124. "Oh, to die, to die for him," thought Rostov.
13125. 
13126. The Tsar said something more which Rostov did not hear, and the
13127. soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted "Hurrah!"
13128. 
13129. Rostov too, bending over his saddle, shouted "Hurrah!" with all his
13130. might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if
13131. only to express his rapture fully.
13132. 
13133. The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.
13134. 
13135. "How can the Emperor be undecided?" thought Rostov, but then even this
13136. indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything else
13137. the Tsar did.
13138. 
13139. That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar's foot, in the narrow
13140. pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay
13141. mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he
13142. moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp.
13143. Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at
13144. last only his white plumes were visible to Rostov from amid the suites
13145. that surrounded the Emperors.
13146. 
13147. Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostov noticed Bolkonski, sitting
13148. his horse indolently and carelessly. Rostov recalled their quarrel of
13149. yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought
13150. not to challenge Bolkonski. "Of course not!" he now thought. "Is it
13151. worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such
13152. love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels
13153. and affronts matter? I love and forgive everybody now."
13154. 
13155. When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began
13156. a ceremonial march past him, and Rostov on Bedouin, recently purchased
13157. from Denisov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron--that is, alone
13158. and in full view of the Emperor.
13159. 
13160. Before he reached him, Rostov, who was a splendid horseman, spurred
13161. Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the
13162. animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his
13163. tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor's eye
13164. upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful
13165. action, as if flying through the air without touching the ground.
13166. 
13167. Rostov himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling
13168. himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but
13169. blissful face "like a vewy devil," as Denisov expressed it.
13170. 
13171. "Fine fellows, the Pavlograds!" remarked the Emperor.
13172. 
13173. "My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire
13174. this instant!" thought Rostov.
13175. 
13176. When the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also
13177. Kutuzov's, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards, about
13178. the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about Bonaparte,
13179. and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the Essen corps
13180. arrived and Prussia took our side.
13181. 
13182. But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His
13183. every word and movement was described with ecstasy.
13184. 
13185. They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the
13186. enemy under the Emperor's command. Commanded by the Emperor himself
13187. they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought
13188. Rostov and most of the officers after the review.
13189. 
13190. All were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles
13191. would have made them.
13192. 
13193. 
13194. 
13195. 
13196. 
13197. CHAPTER IX
13198. 
13199. 
13200. The day after the review, Boris, in his best uniform and with his
13201. comrade Berg's best wishes for success, rode to Olmutz to see Bolkonski,
13202. wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best
13203. post he could--preferably that of adjutant to some important personage,
13204. a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive. "It is all
13205. very well for Rostov, whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a
13206. time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone's
13207. lackey, but I who have nothing but my brains have to make a career
13208. and must not miss opportunities, but must avail myself of them!" he
13209. reflected.
13210. 
13211. He did not find Prince Andrew in Olmutz that day, but the appearance of
13212. the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed
13213. and the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and
13214. courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.
13215. 
13216. He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman's uniform, all these
13217. exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages
13218. with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military
13219. men, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the
13220. Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be
13221. aware of his existence. At the quarters of the commander in chief,
13222. Kutuzov, where he inquired for Bolkonski, all the adjutants and even the
13223. orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great
13224. many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was
13225. heartily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather because of it, next
13226. day, November 15, after dinner he again went to Olmutz and, entering the
13227. house occupied by Kutuzov, asked for Bolkonski. Prince Andrew was in and
13228. Boris was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing,
13229. but in which five beds now stood, and furniture of various kinds: a
13230. table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest the door, was
13231. sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing. Another,
13232. the red, stout Nesvitski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head,
13233. laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was
13234. playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on
13235. the clavichord, sang the tune. Bolkonski was not there. None of these
13236. gentlemen changed his position on seeing Boris. The one who was writing
13237. and whom Boris addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolkonski
13238. was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the
13239. reception room if he wished to see him. Boris thanked him and went to
13240. the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.
13241. 
13242. When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with
13243. that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, "If it
13244. were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment"), was listening
13245. to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very erect, almost
13246. on tiptoe, with a soldier's obsequious expression on his purple face,
13247. reporting something.
13248. 
13249. "Very well, then, be so good as to wait," said Prince Andrew to the
13250. general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected
13251. when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Boris, Prince
13252. Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring
13253. him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful
13254. smile.
13255. 
13256. At that moment Boris clearly realized what he had before surmised, that
13257. in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the
13258. military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was
13259. another, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced,
13260. purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for
13261. his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetskoy. More than
13262. ever was Boris resolved to serve in future not according to the written
13263. code, but under this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having
13264. been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general
13265. who at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the
13266. Guards. Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.
13267. 
13268. "I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about
13269. with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions.
13270. When Germans start being accurate, there's no end to it!"
13271. 
13272. Boris smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to
13273. as something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard
13274. Weyrother's name, or even the term "dispositions."
13275. 
13276. "Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have been
13277. thinking about you."
13278. 
13279. "Yes, I was thinking"--for some reason Boris could not help
13280. blushing--"of asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from
13281. Prince Kuragin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards
13282. won't be in action," he added as if in apology.
13283. 
13284. "All right, all right. We'll talk it over," replied Prince Andrew.
13285. "Only let me report this gentleman's business, and I shall be at your
13286. disposal."
13287. 
13288. While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that
13289. gentleman--evidently not sharing Boris' conception of the advantages
13290. of the unwritten code of subordination--looked so fixedly at the
13291. presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to
13292. say to the adjutant that Boris felt uncomfortable. He turned away and
13293. waited impatiently for Prince Andrew's return from the commander in
13294. chief's room.
13295. 
13296. "You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you," said Prince
13297. Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was.
13298. "It's no use your going to the commander in chief. He would say a lot of
13299. pleasant things, ask you to dinner" ("That would not be bad as regards
13300. the unwritten code," thought Boris), "but nothing more would come of it.
13301. There will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But
13302. this is what we'll do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and an
13303. excellent fellow, Prince Dolgorukov; and though you may not know it, the
13304. fact is that now Kutuzov with his staff and all of us count for
13305. nothing. Everything is now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to
13306. Dolgorukov; I have to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him
13307. about you. We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find
13308. a place for you somewhere nearer the sun."
13309. 
13310. Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young
13311. man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining help
13312. of this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for
13313. himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and
13314. which attracted him. He very readily took up Boris' cause and went with
13315. him to Dolgorukov.
13316. 
13317. It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmutz
13318. occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.
13319. 
13320. That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of
13321. the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, contrary
13322. to the views of the old generals Kutuzov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it
13323. had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte.
13324. The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Boris
13325. arrived at the palace to find Dolgorukov. Everyone at headquarters was
13326. still under the spell of the day's council, at which the party of the
13327. young had triumphed. The voices of those who counseled delay and advised
13328. waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely
13329. silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the
13330. advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council--the
13331. coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it--no
13332. longer seemed to be in the future but in the past. All the advantages
13333. were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to
13334. Napoleon's, were concentrated in one place, the troops inspired by the
13335. Emperors' presence were eager for action. The strategic position where
13336. the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to
13337. the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had ordained that the
13338. Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where
13339. the French had now to be fought; the adjacent locality was known and
13340. shown in every detail on the maps, and Bonaparte, evidently weakened,
13341. was undertaking nothing.
13342. 
13343. Dolgorukov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just returned
13344. from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory
13345. that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his protege, but Prince
13346. Dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Boris
13347. and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in
13348. his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew in French.
13349. 
13350. "Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that
13351. the one that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear
13352. fellow," he said abruptly and eagerly, "I must confess to having been
13353. unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother. What exactitude,
13354. what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what foresight for
13355. every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest detail! No, my
13356. dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones could have been
13357. devised. This combination of Austrian precision with Russian valor--what
13358. more could be wished for?"
13359. 
13360. "So the attack is definitely resolved on?" asked Bolkonski.
13361. 
13362. "And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has
13363. decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him
13364. today for the Emperor." Dolgorukov smiled significantly.
13365. 
13366. "Is that so? And what did he say?" inquired Bolkonski.
13367. 
13368. "What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time. I
13369. tell you he is in our hands, that's certain! But what was most amusing,"
13370. he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, "was that we could not
13371. think how to address the reply! If not as 'Consul' and of course not as
13372. 'Emperor,' it seemed to me it should be to 'General Bonaparte.'"
13373. 
13374. "But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General
13375. Bonaparte, there is a difference," remarked Bolkonski.
13376. 
13377. "That's just it," interrupted Dolgorukov quickly, laughing. "You know
13378. Bilibin--he's a very clever fellow. He suggested addressing him as
13379. 'Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.'"
13380. 
13381. Dolgorukov laughed merrily.
13382. 
13383. "Only that?" said Bolkonski.
13384. 
13385. "All the same, it was Bilibin who found a suitable form for the address.
13386. He is a wise and clever fellow."
13387. 
13388. "What was it?"
13389. 
13390. "To the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement
13391. francais," said Dolgorukov, with grave satisfaction. "Good, wasn't it?"
13392. 
13393. "Yes, but he will dislike it extremely," said Bolkonski.
13394. 
13395. "Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he's dined with him--the
13396. present Emperor--more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a
13397. more cunning or subtle diplomatist--you know, a combination of French
13398. adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and
13399. Count Markov? Count Markov was the only man who knew how to handle him.
13400. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!"
13401. 
13402. And the talkative Dolgorukov, turning now to Boris, now to Prince
13403. Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markov, our ambassador,
13404. purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at
13405. Markov, probably expecting Markov to pick it up for him, and how Markov
13406. immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching
13407. Bonaparte's.
13408. 
13409. "Delightful!" said Bolkonski. "But I have come to you, Prince, as a
13410. petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see..." but before Prince
13411. Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon Dolgorukov to the
13412. Emperor.
13413. 
13414. "Oh, what a nuisance," said Dolgorukov, getting up hurriedly and
13415. pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Boris. "You know I should be
13416. very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young
13417. man." Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of
13418. good-natured, sincere, and animated levity. "But you see... another
13419. time!"
13420. 
13421. Boris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers
13422. as he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here
13423. he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous
13424. movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny,
13425. obedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince Dolgorukov out
13426. into the corridor and met--coming out of the door of the Emperor's room
13427. by which Dolgorukov had entered--a short man in civilian clothes with a
13428. clever face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling his face,
13429. gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression. This short
13430. man nodded to Dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince
13431. Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him and evidently
13432. expecting him to bow or to step out of his way. Prince Andrew did
13433. neither: a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned
13434. away and went down the side of the corridor.
13435. 
13436. "Who was that?" asked Boris.
13437. 
13438. "He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of men--the
13439. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartoryski.... It is such men
13440. as he who decide the fate of nations," added Bolkonski with a sigh he
13441. could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.
13442. 
13443. Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of
13444. Austerlitz, Boris was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgorukov
13445. again and remained for a while with the Ismaylov regiment.
13446. 
13447. 
13448. 
13449. 
13450. 
13451. CHAPTER X
13452. 
13453. 
13454. At dawn on the sixteenth of November, Denisov's squadron, in which
13455. Nicholas Rostov served and which was in Prince Bagration's detachment,
13456. moved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing into action
13457. as arranged, and after going behind other columns for about two thirds
13458. of a mile was stopped on the highroad. Rostov saw the Cossacks and then
13459. the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions
13460. and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagration and
13461. Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear before action
13462. which he had experienced as previously, all the inner struggle to
13463. conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true
13464. hussar in this battle, had been wasted. Their squadron remained in
13465. reserve and Nicholas Rostov spent that day in a dull and wretched mood.
13466. At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah,
13467. and saw wounded being brought back (there were not many of them), and
13468. at last he saw how a whole detachment of French cavalry was brought in,
13469. convoyed by a sotnya of Cossacks. Evidently the affair was over and,
13470. though not big, had been a successful engagement. The men and officers
13471. returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of the occupation of the town of
13472. Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron. The day was bright
13473. and sunny after a sharp night frost, and the cheerful glitter of that
13474. autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed,
13475. not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it, but also by
13476. the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and
13477. adjutants, as they passed Rostov going or coming. And Nicholas, who had
13478. vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that
13479. happy day in inactivity, was all the more depressed.
13480. 
13481. "Come here, Wostov. Let's dwink to dwown our gwief!" shouted Denisov,
13482. who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food.
13483. 
13484. The officers gathered round Denisov's canteen, eating and talking.
13485. 
13486. "There! They are bringing another!" cried one of the officers,
13487. indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by
13488. two Cossacks.
13489. 
13490. One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had
13491. taken from the prisoner.
13492. 
13493. "Sell us that horse!" Denisov called out to the Cossacks.
13494. 
13495. "If you like, your honor!"
13496. 
13497. The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner.
13498. The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German
13499. accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when
13500. he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers,
13501. addressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been
13502. taken, it was not his fault but the corporal's who had sent him to seize
13503. some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there. And at
13504. every word he added: "But don't hurt my little horse!" and stroked the
13505. animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was. Now
13506. he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now, imagining
13507. himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly discipline
13508. and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our rearguard all the
13509. freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was so alien to us.
13510. 
13511. The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostov, being the
13512. richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.
13513. 
13514. "But don't hurt my little horse!" said the Alsatian good-naturedly to
13515. Rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussar.
13516. 
13517. Rostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.
13518. 
13519. "Alley! Alley!" said the Cossack, touching the prisoner's arm to make
13520. him go on.
13521. 
13522. "The Emperor! The Emperor!" was suddenly heard among the hussars.
13523. 
13524. All began to run and bustle, and Rostov saw coming up the road behind
13525. him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone
13526. was in his place, waiting.
13527. 
13528. Rostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.
13529. Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood
13530. amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of
13531. himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to
13532. the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the
13533. day he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of
13534. meeting arrives. Not daring to look round and without looking round, he
13535. was ecstatically conscious of his approach. He felt it not only from the
13536. sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew
13537. near everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more
13538. festive around him. Nearer and nearer to Rostov came that sun shedding
13539. beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself
13540. enveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm, and
13541. majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with
13542. Rostov's feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the
13543. Emperor's voice.
13544. 
13545. "The Pavlograd hussars?" he inquired.
13546. 
13547. "The reserves, sire!" replied a voice, a very human one compared to that
13548. which had said: "The Pavlograd hussars?"
13549. 
13550. The Emperor drew level with Rostov and halted. Alexander's face was
13551. even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It
13552. shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested
13553. the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face
13554. of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the
13555. Emperor's eyes met Rostov's and rested on them for not more than two
13556. seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in
13557. Rostov's soul (it seemed to Rostov that he understood everything), at
13558. any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into Rostov's
13559. face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at once he
13560. raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and
13561. galloped on.
13562. 
13563. The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the
13564. battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve
13565. o'clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward
13566. the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met
13567. him with news of the successful result of the action.
13568. 
13569. This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was
13570. represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the
13571. Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over
13572. the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were
13573. retreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had
13574. passed, the Pavlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau
13575. itself, a petty German town, Rostov saw the Emperor again. In the
13576. market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the
13577. Emperor's arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there
13578. had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite
13579. of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a
13580. different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending
13581. to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked
13582. at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The
13583. wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity
13584. to the Emperor shocked Rostov. Rostov saw how the Emperor's rather round
13585. shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left
13586. foot began convulsively tapping the horse's side with the spur, and how
13587. the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir. An
13588. adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on
13589. a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.
13590. 
13591. "Gently, gently! Can't you do it more gently?" said the Emperor
13592. apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.
13593. 
13594. Rostov saw tears filling the Emperor's eyes and heard him, as he was
13595. riding away, say to Czartoryski: "What a terrible thing war is: what a
13596. terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!"
13597. 
13598. The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight
13599. of the enemy's lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us at
13600. the least firing. The Emperor's gratitude was announced to the vanguard,
13601. rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of vodka.
13602. The campfires crackled and the soldiers' songs resounded even more
13603. merrily than on the previous night. Denisov celebrated his promotion to
13604. the rank of major, and Rostov, who had already drunk enough, at the end
13605. of the feast proposed the Emperor's health. "Not 'our Sovereign, the
13606. Emperor,' as they say at official dinners," said he, "but the health of
13607. our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his
13608. health and to the certain defeat of the French!"
13609. 
13610. "If we fought before," he said, "not letting the French pass, as at
13611. Schon Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We will
13612. all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not saying
13613. it right, I have drunk a good deal--but that is how I feel, and so do
13614. you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!"
13615. 
13616. "Hurrah!" rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.
13617. 
13618. And the old cavalry captain, Kirsten, shouted enthusiastically and no
13619. less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostov.
13620. 
13621. When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kirsten filled
13622. others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the
13623. soldiers' bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest
13624. showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light
13625. of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.
13626. 
13627. "Lads! here's to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over our
13628. enemies! Hurrah!" he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar's baritone.
13629. 
13630. The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.
13631. 
13632. Late that night, when all had separated, Denisov with his short hand
13633. patted his favorite, Rostov, on the shoulder.
13634. 
13635. "As there's no one to fall in love with on campaign, he's fallen in love
13636. with the Tsar," he said.
13637. 
13638. "Denisov, don't make fun of it!" cried Rostov. "It is such a lofty,
13639. beautiful feeling, such a..."
13640. 
13641. "I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove..."
13642. 
13643. "No, you don't understand!"
13644. 
13645. And Rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of
13646. what happiness it would be to die--not in saving the Emperor's life (he
13647. did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes.
13648. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian
13649. arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to
13650. experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle
13651. of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in
13652. love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the
13653. Russian arms.
13654. 
13655. 
13656. 
13657. 
13658. 
13659. CHAPTER XI
13660. 
13661. 
13662. The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician,
13663. was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops
13664. near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and
13665. had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this
13666. indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by
13667. the sight of the killed and wounded.
13668. 
13669. At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with
13670. a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was
13671. brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The
13672. Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday
13673. he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with
13674. Prince Dolgorukov to the advanced post of the French army.
13675. 
13676. It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander
13677. a meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a
13678. personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince
13679. Dolgorukov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate
13680. with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were
13681. actuated by a real desire for peace.
13682. 
13683. Toward evening Dolgorukov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and
13684. remained alone with him for a long time.
13685. 
13686. On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two
13687. days' march and the enemy's outposts after a brief interchange of shots
13688. retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth, a
13689. great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning
13690. of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz was fought.
13691. 
13692. Till midday on the nineteenth, the activity--the eager talk, running
13693. to and fro, and dispatching of adjutants--was confined to the Emperor's
13694. headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached
13695. Kutuzov's headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns. By
13696. evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army,
13697. and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole eighty
13698. thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices,
13699. and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long.
13700. 
13701. The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor's headquarters
13702. in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like
13703. the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock. One wheel
13704. slowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third, and wheels began
13705. to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to work, chimes to
13706. play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with regular motion
13707. as a result of all that activity.
13708. 
13709. Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military
13710. machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as
13711. indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted
13712. to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet
13713. reached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and
13714. the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a
13715. neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared
13716. to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever
13717. catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins
13718. in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.
13719. 
13720. Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable
13721. wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the
13722. hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human
13723. activities of 160,000 Russians and French--all their passions, desires,
13724. remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and
13725. enthusiasm--was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so-called
13726. battle of the three Emperors--that is to say, a slow movement of the
13727. hand on the dial of human history.
13728. 
13729. Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the
13730. commander in chief.
13731. 
13732. At six in the evening, Kutuzov went to the Emperor's headquarters and
13733. after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand
13734. marshal of the court, Count Tolstoy.
13735. 
13736. Bolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the
13737. coming action from Dolgorukov. He felt that Kutuzov was upset and
13738. dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were
13739. dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor's headquarters
13740. everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do
13741. not know: he therefore wished to speak to Dolgorukov.
13742. 
13743. "Well, how d'you do, my dear fellow?" said Dolgorukov, who was sitting
13744. at tea with Bilibin. "The fete is for tomorrow. How is your old fellow?
13745. Out of sorts?"
13746. 
13747. "I won't say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be heard."
13748. 
13749. "But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he
13750. talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte
13751. fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible."
13752. 
13753. "Yes, you have seen him?" said Prince Andrew. "Well, what is Bonaparte
13754. like? How did he impress you?"
13755. 
13756. "Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a
13757. general engagement," repeated Dolgorukov, evidently prizing this general
13758. conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon.
13759. "If he weren't afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview? Why
13760. negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary
13761. to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid, afraid of a
13762. general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!"
13763. 
13764. "But tell me, what is he like, eh?" said Prince Andrew again.
13765. 
13766. "He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him
13767. 'Your Majesty,' but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me! That's
13768. the sort of man he is, and nothing more," replied Dolgorukov, looking
13769. round at Bilibin with a smile.
13770. 
13771. "Despite my great respect for old Kutuzov," he continued, "we should be
13772. a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance
13773. to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in our hands!
13774. No, we mustn't forget Suvorov and his rule--not to put yourself in a
13775. position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe me in war the
13776. energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience
13777. of old Cunctators."
13778. 
13779. "But in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the
13780. outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are
13781. situated," said Prince Andrew.
13782. 
13783. He wished to explain to Dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself
13784. formed.
13785. 
13786. "Oh, that is all the same," Dolgorukov said quickly, and getting up he
13787. spread a map on the table. "All eventualities have been foreseen. If he
13788. is standing before Brunn..."
13789. 
13790. And Prince Dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother's
13791. plan of a flanking movement.
13792. 
13793. Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might have
13794. been as good as Weyrother's, but for the disadvantage that Weyrother's
13795. had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate
13796. the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan, Prince
13797. Dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not at the
13798. map, but at Prince Andrew's face.
13799. 
13800. "There will be a council of war at Kutuzov's tonight, though; you can
13801. say all this there," remarked Dolgorukov.
13802. 
13803. "I will do so," said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.
13804. 
13805. "Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?" said Bilibin, who, till
13806. then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now
13807. was evidently ready with a joke. "Whether tomorrow brings victory or
13808. defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your Kutuzov,
13809. there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The commanders
13810. are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de
13811. Lichtenstein, le Prince, de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on
13812. like all those Polish names."
13813. 
13814. "Be quiet, backbiter!" said Dolgorukov. "It is not true; there are now
13815. two Russians, Miloradovich, and Dokhturov, and there would be a third,
13816. Count Arakcheev, if his nerves were not too weak."
13817. 
13818. "However, I think General Kutuzov has come out," said Prince Andrew. "I
13819. wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!" he added and went out after
13820. shaking hands with Dolgorukov and Bilibin.
13821. 
13822. On the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutuzov,
13823. who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrow's
13824. battle.
13825. 
13826. Kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied: "I
13827. think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolstoy and asked
13828. him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? 'But, my dear
13829. general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military matters
13830. yourself!' Yes... That was the answer I got!"
13831. 
13832. 
13833. 
13834. 
13835. 
13836. CHAPTER XII
13837. 
13838. 
13839. Shortly after nine o'clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his plans
13840. to Kutuzov's quarters where the council of war was to be held. All the
13841. commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief's and with
13842. the exception of Prince Bagration, who declined to come, were all there
13843. at the appointed time.
13844. 
13845. Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his
13846. eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied
13847. and drowsy Kutuzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and
13848. president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be
13849. at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He was
13850. like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was
13851. pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at
13852. headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead
13853. to. Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemy's picket line to
13854. reconnoiter personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and Austrian,
13855. to report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had dictated
13856. the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived at
13857. Kutuzov's.
13858. 
13859. He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the
13860. commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly,
13861. without looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to
13862. questions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful,
13863. weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and
13864. self-confident.
13865. 
13866. Kutuzov was occupying a nobleman's castle of modest dimensions near
13867. Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the commander in
13868. chief's office were gathered Kutuzov himself, Weyrother, and the members
13869. of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only awaited Prince
13870. Bagration to begin the council. At last Bagration's orderly came with
13871. the news that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came in
13872. to inform the commander in chief of this and, availing himself of
13873. permission previously given him by Kutuzov to be present at the council,
13874. he remained in the room.
13875. 
13876. "Since Prince Bagration is not coming, we may begin," said Weyrother,
13877. hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an
13878. enormous map of the environs of Brunn was spread out.
13879. 
13880. Kutuzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over
13881. his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair,
13882. with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound
13883. of Weyrother's voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.
13884. 
13885. "Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late," said he, and nodding his
13886. head he let it droop and again closed his eye.
13887. 
13888. If at first the members of the council thought that Kutuzov was
13889. pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that
13890. followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed
13891. by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for
13892. the dispositions or anything else--he was engaged in satisfying the
13893. irresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with
13894. the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutuzov and,
13895. having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in
13896. a loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the
13897. impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:
13898. 
13899. "Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and
13900. Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805."
13901. 
13902. The dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began as
13903. follows:
13904. 
13905. "As the enemy's left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends
13906. along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there, while we,
13907. on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his right, it is
13908. advantageous to attack the enemy's latter wing especially if we occupy
13909. the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we can both fall on
13910. his flank and pursue him over the plain between Schlappanitz and the
13911. Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz
13912. which cover the enemy's front. For this object it is necessary that...
13913. The first column marches... The second column marches... The third
13914. column marches..." and so on, read Weyrother.
13915. 
13916. The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions.
13917. The tall, fair-haired General Buxhowden stood, leaning his back against
13918. the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen
13919. or even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother,
13920. with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache
13921. twisted upwards, sat the ruddy Miloradovich in a military pose, his
13922. elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders
13923. raised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrother's face, and
13924. only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished
13925. reading. Then Miloradovich looked round significantly at the other
13926. generals. But one could not tell from that significant look whether he
13927. agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements. Next
13928. to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left
13929. his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading,
13930. gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners
13931. a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the
13932. longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised
13933. his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his
13934. thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the
13935. Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his
13936. elbows, as if to say: "You can tell me your views later, but now be so
13937. good as to look at the map and listen." Langeron lifted his eyes with an
13938. expression of perplexity, turned round to Miloradovich as if seeking an
13939. explanation, but meeting the latter's impressive but meaningless gaze
13940. drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.
13941. 
13942. "A geography lesson!" he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough to
13943. be heard.
13944. 
13945. Przebyszewski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his
13946. hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in
13947. attention. Dohkturov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with
13948. an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map
13949. conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He
13950. asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard
13951. and the difficult names of villages. Weyrother complied and Dohkturov
13952. noted them down.
13953. 
13954. When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again
13955. brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at
13956. anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out
13957. such a plan in which the enemy's position was assumed to be known,
13958. whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement.
13959. Langeron's objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief
13960. aim was to show General Weyrother--who had read his dispositions with as
13961. much self-confidence as if he were addressing school children--that he
13962. had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something in
13963. military matters.
13964. 
13965. When the monotonous sound of Weyrother's voice ceased, Kutuzov opened
13966. his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel
13967. is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking, "So
13968. you are still at that silly business!" quickly closed his eye again, and
13969. let his head sink still lower.
13970. 
13971. Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother's vanity
13972. as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily
13973. attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this
13974. plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and
13975. contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections
13976. be they what they might.
13977. 
13978. "If he could attack us, he would have done so today," said he.
13979. 
13980. "So you think he is powerless?" said Langeron.
13981. 
13982. "He has forty thousand men at most," replied Weyrother, with the smile
13983. of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a
13984. case.
13985. 
13986. "In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack," said
13987. Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support
13988. to Miloradovich who was near him.
13989. 
13990. But Miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything
13991. rather than of what the generals were disputing about.
13992. 
13993. "Ma foi!" said he, "tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield."
13994. 
13995. Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was
13996. strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to
13997. have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but
13998. had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.
13999. 
14000. "The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from
14001. his camp," said he. "What does that mean? Either he is retreating, which
14002. is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position." (He
14003. smiled ironically.) "But even if he also took up a position in the
14004. Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our
14005. arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same."
14006. 
14007. "How is that?..." began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting an
14008. opportunity to express his doubts.
14009. 
14010. Kutuzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the generals.
14011. 
14012. "Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow--or rather for today, for it
14013. is past midnight--cannot now be altered," said he. "You have heard them,
14014. and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is nothing more
14015. important..." he paused, "than to have a good sleep."
14016. 
14017. He moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past
14018. midnight. Prince Andrew went out.
14019. 
14020. 
14021. The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to
14022. express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy
14023. impression. Whether Dolgorukov and Weyrother, or Kutuzov, Langeron, and
14024. the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were right--he did
14025. not know. "But was it really not possible for Kutuzov to state his views
14026. plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on account of court and
14027. personal considerations tens of thousands of lives, and my life, my
14028. life," he thought, "must be risked?"
14029. 
14030. "Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow," he thought.
14031. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most distant,
14032. most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered his last
14033. parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days when he
14034. first loved her. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and
14035. for himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out
14036. of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesvitski and began to walk up
14037. and down before it.
14038. 
14039. The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed
14040. mysteriously. "Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!" he thought. "Tomorrow
14041. everything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more, none
14042. of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly,
14043. I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all I
14044. can do." And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the concentration
14045. of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the commanders. And
14046. then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had so long waited,
14047. presents itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly expresses his
14048. opinion to Kutuzov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors. All are struck by
14049. the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to carry them out, so
14050. he takes a regiment, a division-stipulates that no one is to interfere
14051. with his arrangements--leads his division to the decisive point, and
14052. gains the victory alone. "But death and suffering?" suggested another
14053. voice. Prince Andrew, however, did not answer that voice and went on
14054. dreaming of his triumphs. The dispositions for the next battle are
14055. planned by him alone. Nominally he is only an adjutant on Kutuzov's
14056. staff, but he does everything alone. The next battle is won by him
14057. alone. Kutuzov is removed and he is appointed... "Well and then?" asked
14058. the other voice. "If before that you are not ten times wounded, killed,
14059. or betrayed, well... what then?..." "Well then," Prince Andrew answered
14060. himself, "I don't know what will happen and don't want to know, and
14061. can't, but if I want this--want glory, want to be known to men, want to
14062. be loved by them, it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing
14063. but that and live only for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never
14064. tell anyone, but, oh God! what am I to do if I love nothing but fame
14065. and men's esteem? Death, wounds, the loss of family--I fear nothing. And
14066. precious and dear as many persons are to me--father, sister, wife--those
14067. dearest to me--yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them
14068. all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men
14069. I don't know and never shall know, for the love of these men here," he
14070. thought, as he listened to voices in Kutuzov's courtyard. The voices
14071. were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a
14072. coachman's, was teasing Kutuzov's old cook whom Prince Andrew knew, and
14073. who was called Tit. He was saying, "Tit, I say, Tit!"
14074. 
14075. "Well?" returned the old man.
14076. 
14077. "Go, Tit, thresh a bit!" said the wag.
14078. 
14079. "Oh, go to the devil!" called out a voice, drowned by the laughter of
14080. the orderlies and servants.
14081. 
14082. "All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I
14083. value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this
14084. mist!"
14085. 
14086. 
14087. 
14088. 
14089. 
14090. CHAPTER XIII
14091. 
14092. 
14093. That same night, Rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front
14094. of Bagration's detachment. His hussars were placed along the line
14095. in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the
14096. sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our army's
14097. campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him; in front
14098. of him was misty darkness. Rostov could see nothing, peer as he would
14099. into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray, now there was
14100. something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy
14101. ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes.
14102. His eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appeared--now the Emperor, now
14103. Denisov, and now Moscow memories--and he again hurriedly opened his eyes
14104. and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding,
14105. and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the black figures
14106. of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty darkness. "Why
14107. not?... It might easily happen," thought Rostov, "that the Emperor will
14108. meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer; he'll
14109. say: 'Go and find out what's there.' There are many stories of his
14110. getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him
14111. to himself! What if he gave me a place near him? Oh, how I would guard
14112. him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would unmask his deceivers!"
14113. And in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign,
14114. Rostov pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would
14115. not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before
14116. the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout aroused him. He started and opened
14117. his eyes.
14118. 
14119. "Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and
14120. watchword--shaft, Olmutz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in
14121. reserve tomorrow," he thought. "I'll ask leave to go to the front, this
14122. may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It won't be long now before
14123. I am off duty. I'll take another turn and when I get back I'll go to the
14124. general and ask him." He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up
14125. his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It seemed to him that it
14126. was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and
14127. facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall. On this knoll
14128. there was a white patch that Rostov could not at all make out: was it
14129. a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some unmelted snow, or some
14130. white houses? He even thought something moved on that white spot. "I
14131. expect it's snow... that spot... a spot--une tache," he thought. "There
14132. now... it's not a tache... Natasha... sister, black eyes... Na...
14133. tasha... (Won't she be surprised when I tell her how I've seen the
14134. Emperor?) Natasha... take my sabretache..."--"Keep to the right, your
14135. honor, there are bushes here," came the voice of an hussar, past whom
14136. Rostov was riding in the act of falling asleep. Rostov lifted his
14137. head that had sunk almost to his horse's mane and pulled up beside
14138. the hussar. He was succumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish
14139. drowsiness. "But what was I thinking? I mustn't forget. How shall
14140. I speak to the Emperor? No, that's not it--that's tomorrow. Oh yes!
14141. Natasha... sabretache... saber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the
14142. hussars with mustaches. Along the Tverskaya Street rode the hussar with
14143. mustaches... I thought about him too, just opposite Guryev's house...
14144. Old Guryev.... Oh, but Denisov's a fine fellow. But that's all nonsense.
14145. The chief thing is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and
14146. wished to say something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not.
14147. But that's nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important
14148. thing I was thinking of. Yes, Na-tasha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! That's
14149. right!" And his head once more sank to his horse's neck. All at once it
14150. seemed to him that he was being fired at. "What? What? What?... Cut them
14151. down! What?..." said Rostov, waking up. At the moment he opened his eyes
14152. he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn shouts
14153. of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar near him
14154. pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the shouting came
14155. from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another, and all along
14156. the French line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder
14157. and louder. Rostov could hear the sound of French words but could not
14158. distinguish them. The din of many voices was too great; all he could
14159. hear was: "ahahah!" and "rrrr!"
14160. 
14161. "What's that? What do you make of it?" said Rostov to the hussar beside
14162. him. "That must be the enemy's camp!"
14163. 
14164. The hussar did not reply.
14165. 
14166. "Why, don't you hear it?" Rostov asked again, after waiting for a reply.
14167. 
14168. "Who can tell, your honor?" replied the hussar reluctantly.
14169. 
14170. "From the direction, it must be the enemy," repeated Rostov.
14171. 
14172. "It may be he or it may be nothing," muttered the hussar. "It's dark...
14173. Steady!" he cried to his fidgeting horse.
14174. 
14175. Rostov's horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground,
14176. pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting
14177. grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army
14178. of several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and
14179. farther, probably along the line of the French camp. Rostov no longer
14180. wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a
14181. stimulating effect on him. "Vive l'Empereur! L'Empereur!" he now heard
14182. distinctly.
14183. 
14184. "They can't be far off, probably just beyond the stream," he said to the
14185. hussar beside him.
14186. 
14187. The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The sound
14188. of horse's hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was
14189. heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars
14190. suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.
14191. 
14192. "Your honor, the generals!" said the sergeant, riding up to Rostov.
14193. 
14194. Rostov, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with
14195. the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line.
14196. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagration and Prince Dolgorukov with
14197. their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights
14198. and shouts in the enemy's camp. Rostov rode up to Bagration, reported to
14199. him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were
14200. saying.
14201. 
14202. "Believe me," said Prince Dolgorukov, addressing Bagration, "it is
14203. nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to
14204. kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us."
14205. 
14206. "Hardly," said Bagration. "I saw them this evening on that knoll; if
14207. they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too.... Officer!"
14208. said Bagration to Rostov, "are the enemy's skirmishers still there?"
14209. 
14210. "They were there this evening, but now I don't know, your excellency.
14211. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?" replied Rostov.
14212. 
14213. Bagration stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rostov's face in
14214. the mist.
14215. 
14216. "Well, go and see," he said, after a pause.
14217. 
14218. "Yes, sir."
14219. 
14220. Rostov spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fedchenko and two other
14221. hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction
14222. from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be
14223. riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty
14224. distance where no one had been before him. Bagration called to him from
14225. the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rostov pretended not to hear
14226. him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes
14227. for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes.
14228. Having descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or
14229. the enemy's fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and
14230. distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river, but
14231. when he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto the road
14232. he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it
14233. and ride over the black field up the hillside. To keep to the road which
14234. gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be
14235. easier to see people coming along it. "Follow me!" said he, crossed the
14236. road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where
14237. the French pickets had been standing that evening.
14238. 
14239. "Your honor, there he is!" cried one of the hussars behind him. And
14240. before Rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that had
14241. suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report,
14242. and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed
14243. out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan.
14244. Rostov turned his horse and galloped back. Four more reports followed
14245. at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in
14246. different tones. Rostov reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen,
14247. like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace. "Well, some
14248. more! Some more!" a merry voice was saying in his soul. But no more
14249. shots came.
14250. 
14251. Only when approaching Bagration did Rostov let his horse gallop again,
14252. and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.
14253. 
14254. Dolgorukov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had
14255. only lit fires to deceive us.
14256. 
14257. "What does that prove?" he was saying as Rostov rode up. "They might
14258. retreat and leave the pickets."
14259. 
14260. "It's plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince," said Bagration.
14261. "Wait till tomorrow morning, we'll find out everything tomorrow."
14262. 
14263. "The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was
14264. in the evening," reported Rostov, stooping forward with his hand at the
14265. salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride
14266. and especially by the sound of the bullets.
14267. 
14268. "Very good, very good," said Bagration. "Thank you, officer."
14269. 
14270. "Your excellency," said Rostov, "may I ask a favor?"
14271. 
14272. "What is it?"
14273. 
14274. "Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached to
14275. the first squadron?"
14276. 
14277. "What's your name?"
14278. 
14279. "Count Rostov."
14280. 
14281. "Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me."
14282. 
14283. "Count Ilya Rostov's son?" asked Dolgorukov.
14284. 
14285. But Rostov did not reply.
14286. 
14287. "Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?"
14288. 
14289. "I will give the order."
14290. 
14291. "Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the Emperor,"
14292. thought Rostov.
14293. 
14294. "Thank God!"
14295. 
14296. 
14297. The fires and shouting in the enemy's army were occasioned by the fact
14298. that while Napoleon's proclamation was being read to the troops the
14299. Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing him,
14300. lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, "Vive l'Empereur!"
14301. Napoleon's proclamation was as follows:
14302. 
14303. 
14304. Soldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
14305. Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at
14306. Hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position we
14307. occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on
14308. the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct
14309. your battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor
14310. carry disorder and confusion into the enemy's ranks, but should victory
14311. be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see your Emperor exposing
14312. himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no doubt of
14313. victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of
14314. the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.
14315. 
14316. Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every
14317. man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings
14318. of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will
14319. conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh
14320. French troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace
14321. I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.
14322. 
14323. NAPOLEON
14324. 
14325. 
14326. 
14327. 
14328. 
14329. CHAPTER XIV
14330. 
14331. 
14332. At five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the
14333. center, the reserves, and Bagration's right flank had not yet moved, but
14334. on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which
14335. were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French right
14336. flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan, were
14337. already up and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into which they were
14338. throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart. It was cold and
14339. dark. The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the
14340. soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to
14341. warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the
14342. remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they
14343. did not want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides
14344. were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds
14345. of the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near a
14346. commanding officer's quarters, the regiment began to move: the soldiers
14347. ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots, their bags
14348. into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank. The officers
14349. buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches, and moved
14350. along the ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and
14351. packed the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and battalion
14352. and regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave final
14353. instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men who remained
14354. behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded. The
14355. column moved forward without knowing where and unable, from the masses
14356. around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see either the place
14357. they were leaving or that to which they were going.
14358. 
14359. A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as
14360. much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, whatever
14361. strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is
14362. always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so
14363. the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks,
14364. the same sergeant major Ivan Mitrich, the same company dog Jack, and the
14365. same commanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which
14366. his ship is sailing, but on the day of battle--heaven knows how and
14367. whence--a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral
14368. atmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive
14369. and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of
14370. battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
14371. regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning
14372. what is going on around them.
14373. 
14374. The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could
14375. not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level
14376. ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might
14377. encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced
14378. for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills,
14379. avoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and
14380. nowhere encountering the enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became
14381. aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns
14382. were moving in the same direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that
14383. to the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going
14384. too.
14385. 
14386. "There now, the Kurskies have also gone past," was being said in the
14387. ranks.
14388. 
14389. "It's wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last
14390. night I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular
14391. Moscow!"
14392. 
14393. Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to
14394. the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of
14395. humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves
14396. to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops
14397. marched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to
14398. an attack. But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog,
14399. the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness
14400. of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks. How such
14401. a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define, but it
14402. certainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly,
14403. and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek. Had the Russian army been
14404. alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before
14405. this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as
14406. it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid
14407. Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been
14408. occasioned by the sausage eaters.
14409. 
14410. "Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up
14411. against the French?"
14412. 
14413. "No, one can't hear them. They'd be firing if we had."
14414. 
14415. "They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in
14416. the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It's all those damned
14417. Germans' muddling! What stupid devils!"
14418. 
14419. "Yes, I'd send them on in front, but no fear, they're crowding up
14420. behind. And now here we stand hungry."
14421. 
14422. "I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the
14423. way," said an officer.
14424. 
14425. "Ah, those damned Germans! They don't know their own country!" said
14426. another.
14427. 
14428. "What division are you?" shouted an adjutant, riding up.
14429. 
14430. "The Eighteenth."
14431. 
14432. "Then why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you won't
14433. get there till evening."
14434. 
14435. "What stupid orders! They don't themselves know what they are doing!"
14436. said the officer and rode off.
14437. 
14438. Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.
14439. 
14440. "Tafa-lafa! But what he's jabbering no one can make out," said a
14441. soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. "I'd shoot them, the
14442. scoundrels!"
14443. 
14444. "We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven't got
14445. halfway. Fine orders!" was being repeated on different sides.
14446. 
14447. And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to
14448. turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
14449. Germans.
14450. 
14451. The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was
14452. moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center
14453. was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
14454. ordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in
14455. front of the infantry, who had to wait.
14456. 
14457. At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a
14458. Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be
14459. halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to
14460. blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After
14461. an hour's delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog that
14462. was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they were
14463. descending. In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another, at
14464. first irregularly at varying intervals--trata... tat--and then more and
14465. more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream began.
14466. 
14467. Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having
14468. stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their
14469. commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through
14470. the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around
14471. them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy
14472. lazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from
14473. the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown
14474. surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this way the action
14475. began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down
14476. into the valley. The fourth column, with which Kutuzov was, stood on the
14477. Pratzen Heights.
14478. 
14479. Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the
14480. higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was
14481. going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed,
14482. six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one
14483. knew till after eight o'clock.
14484. 
14485. It was nine o'clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea down
14486. below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood
14487. with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was a clear
14488. blue sky, and the sun's vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson
14489. float on the surface of that milky sea of mist. The whole French army,
14490. and even Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side of
14491. the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we
14492. intended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this
14493. side, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could
14494. distinguish a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak
14495. which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab
14496. horse a little in front of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills
14497. which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian
14498. troops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of
14499. firing in the valley. Not a single muscle of his face--which in those
14500. days was still thin--moved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one
14501. spot. His predictions were being justified. Part of the Russian force
14502. had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and
14503. part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack
14504. and regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that in
14505. a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian
14506. columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one
14507. direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into
14508. the mist. From information he had received the evening before, from the
14509. sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night,
14510. by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all
14511. indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away
14512. in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted
14513. the center of the Russian army, and that that center was already
14514. sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still he did not
14515. begin the engagement.
14516. 
14517. Today was a great day for him--the anniversary of his coronation. Before
14518. dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and in good
14519. spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy
14520. mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds. He sat
14521. motionless, looking at the heights visible above the mist, and his cold
14522. face wore that special look of confident, self-complacent happiness that
14523. one sees on the face of a boy happily in love. The marshals stood
14524. behind him not venturing to distract his attention. He looked now at the
14525. Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating up out of the mist.
14526. 
14527. When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were
14528. aglow with dazzling light--as if he had only awaited this to begin the
14529. action--he drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign
14530. with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The marshals,
14531. accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and
14532. a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly
14533. toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by
14534. Russian troops moving down the valley to their left.
14535. 
14536. 
14537. 
14538. 
14539. 
14540. CHAPTER XV
14541. 
14542. 
14543. At eight o'clock Kutuzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth
14544. column, Miloradovich's, the one that was to take the place of
14545. Przebyszewski's and Langeron's columns which had already gone down into
14546. the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them
14547. the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead that
14548. column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he halted.
14549. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the commander
14550. in chief's suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement and
14551. irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a
14552. long-awaited moment. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of
14553. his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola. How it would come about he did not
14554. know, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality and the position of
14555. our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone
14556. in our army. His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now be
14557. carried out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother's plan, Prince
14558. Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as
14559. might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.
14560. 
14561. To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces
14562. could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would
14563. concentrate. "There we shall encounter difficulties, and there," thought
14564. he, "I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there, standard in
14565. hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me."
14566. 
14567. He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.
14568. Seeing them he kept thinking, "That may be the very standard with which
14569. I shall lead the army."
14570. 
14571. In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was
14572. a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a
14573. milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which
14574. our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing.
14575. Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb
14576. of the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist,
14577. some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably
14578. was, for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were
14579. entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and
14580. then a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses
14581. of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist. In front and
14582. behind moved infantry. The commander in chief was standing at the end of
14583. the village letting the troops pass by him. That morning Kutuzov seemed
14584. worn and irritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt
14585. without any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in
14586. front.
14587. 
14588. "Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village!"
14589. he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. "Don't you understand,
14590. your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not defile through narrow
14591. village streets when we are marching against the enemy?"
14592. 
14593. "I intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,"
14594. answered the general.
14595. 
14596. Kutuzov laughed bitterly.
14597. 
14598. "You'll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy! Very
14599. fine!"
14600. 
14601. "The enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the
14602. dispositions..."
14603. 
14604. "The dispositions!" exclaimed Kutuzov bitterly. "Who told you that?...
14605. Kindly do as you are ordered."
14606. 
14607. "Yes, sir."
14608. 
14609. "My dear fellow," Nesvitski whispered to Prince Andrew, "the old man is
14610. as surly as a dog."
14611. 
14612. An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat
14613. galloped up to Kutuzov and asked in the Emperor's name had the fourth
14614. column advanced into action.
14615. 
14616. Kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon
14617. Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutuzov's malevolent and
14618. caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what was being done
14619. was not his adjutant's fault, and still not answering the Austrian
14620. adjutant, he addressed Bolkonski.
14621. 
14622. "Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the
14623. village. Tell it to stop and await my orders."
14624. 
14625. Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.
14626. 
14627. "And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted," he added. "What are
14628. they doing? What are they doing?" he murmured to himself, still not
14629. replying to the Austrian.
14630. 
14631. Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.
14632. 
14633. Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped
14634. the third division and convinced himself that there really were no
14635. sharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head of the
14636. regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief's order to throw
14637. out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops
14638. in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away.
14639. There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent
14640. hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the commander in chief's
14641. name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back. Kutuzov
14642. still in the same place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle
14643. with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes. The
14644. troops were no longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets
14645. on the ground.
14646. 
14647. "All right, all right!" he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a
14648. general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all
14649. the left-flank columns had already descended.
14650. 
14651. "Plenty of time, your excellency," muttered Kutuzov in the midst of a
14652. yawn. "Plenty of time," he repeated.
14653. 
14654. Just then at a distance behind Kutuzov was heard the sound of regiments
14655. saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended
14656. line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were
14657. greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front
14658. of which Kutuzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one
14659. side and looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped
14660. what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them
14661. rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with
14662. white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who
14663. was in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors
14664. followed by their suites. Kutuzov, affecting the manners of an old
14665. soldier at the front, gave the command "Attention!" and rode up to the
14666. Emperors with a salute. His whole appearance and manner were suddenly
14667. transformed. He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without
14668. reasoning. With an affectation of respect which evidently struck
14669. Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.
14670. 
14671. This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face
14672. of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished.
14673. After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of
14674. Olmutz where Bolkonski had seen him for the first time abroad, but there
14675. was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his
14676. fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying
14677. expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent
14678. youth.
14679. 
14680. At the Olmutz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed
14681. brighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two
14682. miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round
14683. at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own. Czartoryski,
14684. Novosiltsev, Prince Volkonsky, Strogonov, and the others, all richly
14685. dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly
14686. heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the
14687. Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very
14688. erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and
14689. preoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked
14690. some question--"Most likely he is asking at what o'clock they started,"
14691. thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with a smile
14692. he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brunn. In the
14693. Emperors' suite were the picked young orderly officers of the Guard and
14694. line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them were grooms leading the
14695. Tsar's beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths.
14696. 
14697. As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters
14698. a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of
14699. success reached Kutuzov's cheerless staff with the galloping advent of
14700. all these brilliant young men.
14701. 
14702. "Why aren't you beginning, Michael Ilarionovich?" said the Emperor
14703. Alexander hurriedly to Kutuzov, glancing courteously at the same time at
14704. the Emperor Francis.
14705. 
14706. "I am waiting, Your Majesty," answered Kutuzov, bending forward
14707. respectfully.
14708. 
14709. The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not
14710. quite heard.
14711. 
14712. "Waiting, Your Majesty," repeated Kutuzov. (Prince Andrew noted that
14713. Kutuzov's upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word "waiting.")
14714. "Not all the columns have formed up yet, Your Majesty."
14715. 
14716. The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his
14717. rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosiltsev who was near him, as
14718. if complaining of Kutuzov.
14719. 
14720. "You know, Michael Ilarionovich, we are not on the Empress' Field where
14721. a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled," said the
14722. Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting him if
14723. not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the Emperor
14724. Francis continued to look about him and did not listen.
14725. 
14726. "That is just why I do not begin, sire," said Kutuzov in a resounding
14727. voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard, and
14728. again something in his face twitched--"That is just why I do not begin,
14729. sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Empress' Field," said
14730. clearly and distinctly.
14731. 
14732. In the Emperor's suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
14733. dissatisfaction and reproach. "Old though he may be, he should not, he
14734. certainly should not, speak like that," their glances seemed to say.
14735. 
14736. The Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutuzov's eye waiting to
14737. hear whether he would say anything more. But Kutuzov, with respectfully
14738. bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence lasted for about a
14739. minute.
14740. 
14741. "However, if you command it, Your Majesty," said Kutuzov, lifting his
14742. head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but
14743. submissive general.
14744. 
14745. He touched his horse and having called Miloradovich, the commander of
14746. the column, gave him the order to advance.
14747. 
14748. The troops again began to move, and two battalions of the Novgorod and
14749. one of the Apsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.
14750. 
14751. As this Apsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Miloradovich,
14752. without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous
14753. tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front
14754. and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined
14755. in his horse before the Emperor.
14756. 
14757. "God be with you, general!" said the Emperor.
14758. 
14759. "Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite, sire,"
14760. * he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the
14761. gentlemen of the Tsar's suite by his poor French.
14762. 
14763. 
14764.      * "Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to
14765.      do, Sire."
14766. 
14767. 
14768. Miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little
14769. behind the Emperor. The Apsheron men, excited by the Tsar's presence,
14770. passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk
14771. pace.
14772. 
14773. "Lads!" shouted Miloradovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery
14774. voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect
14775. of battle, and by the sight of the gallant Apsherons, his comrades in
14776. Suvorov's time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that
14777. he forgot the sovereigns' presence. "Lads, it's not the first village
14778. you've had to take," cried he.
14779. 
14780. "Glad to do our best!" shouted the soldiers.
14781. 
14782. The Emperor's horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had
14783. carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the
14784. field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and
14785. pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the
14786. Empress' Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor
14787. of the nearness of the Emperor Francis' black cob, nor of all that was
14788. being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.
14789. 
14790. The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a
14791. remark to him, pointing to the gallant Apsherons.
14792. 
14793. 
14794. 
14795. 
14796. 
14797. CHAPTER XVI
14798. 
14799. 
14800. Kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the
14801. carabineers.
14802. 
14803. When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he
14804. stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an
14805. inn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops were
14806. marching along both.
14807. 
14808. The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible
14809. about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down below, on
14810. the left, the firing became more distinct. Kutuzov had stopped and was
14811. speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind
14812. looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.
14813. 
14814. "Look, look!" said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the
14815. distance, but down the hill before him. "It's the French!"
14816. 
14817. The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying
14818. to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces
14819. suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a
14820. mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in
14821. front of us.
14822. 
14823. "It's the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But how is
14824. that?" said different voices.
14825. 
14826. With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more
14827. than five hundred paces from where Kutuzov was standing, a dense French
14828. column coming up to meet the Apsherons.
14829. 
14830. "Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come," thought
14831. Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutuzov.
14832. 
14833. "The Apsherons must be stopped, your excellency," cried he. But at that
14834. very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard quite
14835. close at hand, and a voice of naive terror barely two steps from Prince
14836. Andrew shouted, "Brothers! All's lost!" And at this as if at a command,
14837. everyone began to run.
14838. 
14839. Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five
14840. minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it
14841. have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to
14842. be carried back with it oneself. Bolkonski only tried not to lose touch
14843. with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was
14844. happening in front of him. Nesvitski with an angry face, red and unlike
14845. himself, was shouting to Kutuzov that if he did not ride away at once
14846. he would certainly be taken prisoner. Kutuzov remained in the same place
14847. and without answering drew out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing from
14848. his cheek. Prince Andrew forced his way to him.
14849. 
14850. "You are wounded?" he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of his
14851. lower jaw.
14852. 
14853. "The wound is not here, it is there!" said Kutuzov, pressing the
14854. handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers.
14855. "Stop them!" he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that
14856. it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.
14857. 
14858. A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.
14859. 
14860. The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
14861. them it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, "Get on! Why
14862. are you hindering us?" Another in the same place turned round and fired
14863. in the air; a third was striking the horse Kutuzov himself rode. Having
14864. by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men, Kutuzov,
14865. with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a sound of
14866. artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the crowd of
14867. fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kutuzov, saw on the slope
14868. of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and
14869. Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up stood some Russian infantry,
14870. neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the
14871. fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and
14872. approached Kutuzov. Of Kutuzov's suite only four remained. They were all
14873. pale and exchanged looks in silence.
14874. 
14875. "Stop those wretches!" gasped Kutuzov to the regimental commander,
14876. pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish
14877. him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across
14878. Kutuzov's suite like a flock of little birds.
14879. 
14880. The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutuzov, were firing
14881. at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg;
14882. several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the
14883. flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the
14884. muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without
14885. orders.
14886. 
14887. "Oh! Oh! Oh!" groaned Kutuzov despairingly and looked around....
14888. "Bolkonski!" he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness
14889. of the feebleness of age, "Bolkonski!" he whispered, pointing to the
14890. disordered battalion and at the enemy, "what's that?"
14891. 
14892. But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of
14893. shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to
14894. the standard.
14895. 
14896. "Forward, lads!" he shouted in a voice piercing as a child's.
14897. 
14898. "Here it is!" thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing
14899. with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him. Several
14900. soldiers fell.
14901. 
14902. "Hurrah!" shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the heavy
14903. standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion
14904. would follow him.
14905. 
14906. And really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then
14907. another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting "Hurrah!" and
14908. overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag
14909. that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew's hands, but he
14910. was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and,
14911. dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our
14912. artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned
14913. their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry
14914. soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns
14915. round. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces
14916. of the cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and
14917. to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped. But
14918. he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front
14919. of him--at the battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired
14920. gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while
14921. a French soldier tugged at the other. He could distinctly see the
14922. distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who
14923. evidently did not realize what they were doing.
14924. 
14925. "What are they about?" thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them. "Why
14926. doesn't the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why doesn't the
14927. Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the Frenchman remembers
14928. his bayonet and stabs him...."
14929. 
14930. And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to
14931. the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had
14932. triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him,
14933. was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It
14934. seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head
14935. with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of
14936. it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had
14937. been looking at.
14938. 
14939. "What's this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way," thought he, and
14940. fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of
14941. the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner had
14942. been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved.
14943. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the sky--the
14944. lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds
14945. gliding slowly across it. "How quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not at all
14946. as I ran," thought Prince Andrew--"not as we ran, shouting and fighting,
14947. not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry
14948. faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds glide
14949. across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that lofty sky
14950. before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All is vanity,
14951. all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing, nothing, but
14952. that. But even it does not exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace.
14953. Thank God!..."
14954. 
14955. 
14956. 
14957. 
14958. 
14959. CHAPTER XVII
14960. 
14961. 
14962. On our right flank commanded by Bagration, at nine o'clock the battle
14963. had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorukov's demand to
14964. commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself,
14965. Prince Bagration proposed to Dolgorukov to send to inquire of the
14966. commander in chief. Bagration knew that as the distance between the two
14967. flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed
14968. (which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief
14969. (which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before
14970. evening.
14971. 
14972. Bagration cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite,
14973. and the boyish face Rostov, breathless with excitement and hope, was the
14974. first to catch his eye. He sent him.
14975. 
14976. "And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in chief,
14977. your excellency?" said Rostov, with his hand to his cap.
14978. 
14979. "You can give the message to His Majesty," said Dolgorukov, hurriedly
14980. interrupting Bagration.
14981. 
14982. On being relieved from picket duty Rostov had managed to get a few
14983. hours' sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, with
14984. elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in that
14985. state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and easy.
14986. 
14987. All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a
14988. general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was
14989. orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a
14990. message to Kutuzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning
14991. was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of
14992. joy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and
14993. galloped along the line. At first he rode along the line of Bagration's
14994. troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were standing
14995. motionless; then he came to the region occupied by Uvarov's cavalry
14996. and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle; having
14997. passed Uvarov's cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and
14998. musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder and louder.
14999. 
15000. In the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots
15001. at irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots,
15002. but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before
15003. Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes
15004. several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a
15005. general roar.
15006. 
15007. He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another
15008. down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading,
15009. and mingling with one another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets
15010. visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow
15011. lines of artillery with green caissons.
15012. 
15013. Rostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going
15014. on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make
15015. out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of some sort
15016. were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops; but why,
15017. whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out. These sights
15018. and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him; on the
15019. contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.
15020. 
15021. "Go on! Go on! Give it them!" he mentally exclaimed at these sounds,
15022. and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and
15023. farther into the region where the army was already in action.
15024. 
15025. "How it will be there I don't know, but all will be well!" thought
15026. Rostov.
15027. 
15028. After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the
15029. line (the Guards) was already in action.
15030. 
15031. "So much the better! I shall see it close," he thought.
15032. 
15033. He was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came
15034. galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered
15035. ranks were returning from the attack. Rostov got out of their way,
15036. involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.
15037. 
15038. "That is no business of mine," he thought. He had not ridden many
15039. hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole
15040. width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white
15041. uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and
15042. across his path. Rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of the
15043. way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the
15044. same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the
15045. horses were already galloping. Rostov heard the thud of their hoofs and
15046. the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and
15047. even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our Horse Guards,
15048. advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them.
15049. 
15050. The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses.
15051. Rostov could already see their faces and heard the command: "Charge!"
15052. shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed.
15053. Rostov, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French,
15054. galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but still was
15055. not in time to avoid them.
15056. 
15057. The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily
15058. on seeing Rostov before him, with whom he would inevitably collide.
15059. This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostov and his Bedouin over
15060. (Rostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men
15061. and horses) had it not occurred to Rostov to flourish his whip before
15062. the eyes of the Guardsman's horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen hands
15063. high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove
15064. his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and
15065. extending its neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse Guards
15066. passed Rostov before he heard them shout, "Hurrah!" and looking back saw
15067. that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry
15068. with red epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing more, for
15069. immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke
15070. enveloped everything.
15071. 
15072. At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in
15073. the smoke, Rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where
15074. he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that
15075. amazed the French themselves. Rostov was horrified to hear later that
15076. of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant,
15077. rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their
15078. thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.
15079. 
15080. "Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see
15081. the Emperor immediately!" thought Rostov and galloped on.
15082. 
15083. When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and
15084. around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so
15085. much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on
15086. the soldiers' faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the
15087. officers.
15088. 
15089. Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a
15090. voice calling him by name.
15091. 
15092. "Rostov!"
15093. 
15094. "What?" he answered, not recognizing Boris.
15095. 
15096. "I say, we've been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!" said Boris
15097. with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under
15098. fire for the first time.
15099. 
15100. Rostov stopped.
15101. 
15102. "Have you?" he said. "Well, how did it go?"
15103. 
15104. "We drove them back!" said Boris with animation, growing talkative. "Can
15105. you imagine it?" and he began describing how the Guards, having taken
15106. up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were
15107. Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged
15108. by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had
15109. unexpectedly to go into action. Rostov without hearing Boris to the end
15110. spurred his horse.
15111. 
15112. "Where are you off to?" asked Boris.
15113. 
15114. "With a message to His Majesty."
15115. 
15116. "There he is!" said Boris, thinking Rostov had said "His Highness,"
15117. and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning
15118. brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse
15119. Guards' jacket, shouting something to a pale, white uniformed Austrian
15120. officer.
15121. 
15122. "But that's the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the
15123. Emperor," said Rostov, and was about to spur his horse.
15124. 
15125. "Count! Count!" shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager
15126. as Boris. "Count! I am wounded in my right hand" (and he showed his
15127. bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) "and I remained at the
15128. front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family--the von
15129. Bergs--have been knights!"
15130. 
15131. He said something more, but Rostov did not wait to hear it and rode
15132. away.
15133. 
15134. Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostov, to avoid
15135. again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse
15136. Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place
15137. where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he
15138. heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops,
15139. where he could never have expected the enemy to be.
15140. 
15141. "What can it be?" he thought. "The enemy in the rear of our army?
15142. Impossible!" And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
15143. and for the issue of the whole battle. "But be that what it may,"
15144. he reflected, "there is no riding round it now. I must look for the
15145. commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
15146. the rest."
15147. 
15148. The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostov was more and
15149. more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of
15150. Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.
15151. 
15152. "What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is firing?"
15153. Rostov kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian soldiers
15154. running in confused crowds across his path.
15155. 
15156. "The devil knows! They've killed everybody! It's all up now!" he
15157. was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who
15158. understood what was happening as little as he did.
15159. 
15160. "Kill the Germans!" shouted one.
15161. 
15162. "May the devil take them--the traitors!"
15163. 
15164. "Zum Henker diese Russen!" * muttered a German.
15165. 
15166. 
15167.     * "Hang these Russians!"
15168. 
15169. 
15170. Several wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams,
15171. and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down.
15172. Rostov learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing
15173. at one another.
15174. 
15175. "My God! What does it all mean?" thought he. "And here, where at any
15176. moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a handful
15177. of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it can't be that, it can't be! Only
15178. to get past them quicker, quicker!"
15179. 
15180. The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostov's head. Though he
15181. saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he
15182. had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not, did
15183. not wish to, believe that.
15184. 
15185. 
15186. 
15187. 
15188. 
15189. CHAPTER XVIII
15190. 
15191. 
15192. Rostov had been ordered to look for Kutuzov and the Emperor near the
15193. village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer
15194. were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He
15195. urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but
15196. the farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on
15197. which he had come out was thronged with caleches, carriages of all
15198. sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and
15199. some not. This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the
15200. dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries
15201. stationed on the Pratzen Heights.
15202. 
15203. "Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutuzov?" Rostov kept asking everyone he
15204. could stop, but got no answer from anyone.
15205. 
15206. At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.
15207. 
15208. "Eh, brother! They've all bolted long ago!" said the soldier, laughing
15209. for some reason and shaking himself free.
15210. 
15211. Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostov stopped the
15212. horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to
15213. question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a
15214. carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and
15215. that he was dangerously wounded.
15216. 
15217. "It can't be!" said Rostov. "It must have been someone else."
15218. 
15219. "I saw him myself," replied the man with a self-confident smile of
15220. derision. "I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I've seen
15221. him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in the
15222. carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black horses fly!
15223. Gracious me, they did rattle past! It's time I knew the Imperial horses
15224. and Ilya Ivanych. I don't think Ilya drives anyone except the Tsar!"
15225. 
15226. Rostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded
15227. officer passing by addressed him:
15228. 
15229. "Who is it you want?" he asked. "The commander in chief? He was killed
15230. by a cannon ball--struck in the breast before our regiment."
15231. 
15232. "Not killed--wounded!" another officer corrected him.
15233. 
15234. "Who? Kutuzov?" asked Rostov.
15235. 
15236. "Not Kutuzov, but what's his name--well, never mind... there are not
15237. many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders are
15238. there," said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek, and he
15239. walked on.
15240. 
15241. Rostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now
15242. going. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to
15243. doubt it now. Rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which
15244. he saw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now to say
15245. to the Tsar or to Kutuzov, even if they were alive and unwounded?
15246. 
15247. "Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!" a
15248. soldier shouted to him. "They'd kill you there!"
15249. 
15250. "Oh, what are you talking about?" said another. "Where is he to go? That
15251. way is nearer."
15252. 
15253. Rostov considered, and then went in the direction where they said he
15254. would be killed.
15255. 
15256. "It's all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to save
15257. myself?" he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest number
15258. of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not yet
15259. occupied that region, and the Russians--the uninjured and slightly
15260. wounded--had left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of manure
15261. on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each
15262. couple of acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one
15263. could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes feigned--or
15264. so it seemed to Rostov. He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all
15265. these suffering men, and he felt afraid--afraid not for his life, but
15266. for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of
15267. these unfortunates.
15268. 
15269. The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and
15270. wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant
15271. riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The
15272. sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around
15273. him merged in Rostov's mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for
15274. himself. He remembered his mother's last letter. "What would she feel,"
15275. thought he, "if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed
15276. at me?"
15277. 
15278. In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from
15279. the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less
15280. disordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire
15281. sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle
15282. was lost. No one whom Rostov asked could tell him where the Emperor
15283. or Kutuzov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was
15284. correct, others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had
15285. spread by the fact that the Emperor's carriage had really galloped from
15286. the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count
15287. Tolstoy, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the
15288. Emperor's suite. One officer told Rostov that he had seen someone from
15289. headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither Rostov rode,
15290. not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When he had
15291. ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops, he
15292. saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men on horseback
15293. facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to
15294. Rostov; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which Rostov fancied he
15295. had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his horse with his spurs,
15296. and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only a little earth crumbled
15297. from the bank under the horse's hind hoofs. Turning the horse sharply,
15298. he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horseman with
15299. the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do the same. The
15300. rider, whose figure seemed familiar to Rostov and involuntarily riveted
15301. his attention, made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and
15302. by that gesture Rostov instantly recognized his lamented and adored
15303. monarch.
15304. 
15305. "But it can't be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!" thought
15306. Rostov. At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostov saw the
15307. beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory. The Emperor
15308. was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm, the
15309. mildness of his features, was all the greater. Rostov was happy in the
15310. assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false. He
15311. was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even ought to
15312. go straight to him and give the message Dolgorukov had ordered him to
15313. deliver.
15314. 
15315. But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the
15316. thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a
15317. chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is
15318. alone with her, so Rostov, now that he had attained what he had longed
15319. for more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach
15320. the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be
15321. inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.
15322. 
15323. "What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his
15324. being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or
15325. painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him
15326. now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of
15327. him?" Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that
15328. he had composed in his imagination could he now recall. Those speeches
15329. were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the most part
15330. to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally when he was
15331. dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds, and
15332. while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.
15333. 
15334. "Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right
15335. flank now that it is nearly four o'clock and the battle is lost?
15336. No, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his
15337. reflections. Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind
15338. look or bad opinion from him," Rostov decided; and sorrowfully and with
15339. a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at the Tsar,
15340. who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.
15341. 
15342. While Rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away,
15343. Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the
15344. Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him
15345. to cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling
15346. unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him.
15347. Rostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke
15348. long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping,
15349. covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll's hand.
15350. 
15351. "And I might have been in his place!" thought Rostov, and hardly
15352. restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter
15353. despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.
15354. 
15355. His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was
15356. the cause of his grief.
15357. 
15358. He might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign. It
15359. was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not
15360. made use of it.... "What have I done?" thought he. And he turned round
15361. and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but there
15362. was no one beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages were
15363. passing by. From one of the drivers he learned that Kutuzov's staff were
15364. not far off, in the village the vehicles were going to. Rostov
15365. followed them. In front of him walked Kutuzov's groom leading horses
15366. in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old,
15367. bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.
15368. 
15369. "Tit! I say, Tit!" said the groom.
15370. 
15371. "What?" answered the old man absent-mindedly.
15372. 
15373. "Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!"
15374. 
15375. "Oh, you fool!" said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed in
15376. silence, and then the same joke was repeated.
15377. 
15378. 
15379. Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points. More
15380. than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.
15381. 
15382. Przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other columns
15383. after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused
15384. masses.
15385. 
15386. The remains of Langeron's and Dokhturov's mingled forces were crowding
15387. around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of Augesd.
15388. 
15389. After five o'clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade
15390. (delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous
15391. batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our
15392. retreating forces.
15393. 
15394. In the rearguard, Dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept up
15395. a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops. It
15396. was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the
15397. old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully
15398. angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the
15399. floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for
15400. so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully
15401. driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty
15402. with flour whitening their carts--on that narrow dam amid the wagons and
15403. the cannon, under the horses' hoofs and between the wagon wheels, men
15404. disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one another,
15405. dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to move on
15406. a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way.
15407. 
15408. Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or
15409. a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and
15410. splashing with blood those near them.
15411. 
15412. Dolokhov--now an officer--wounded in the arm, and on foot, with the
15413. regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,
15414. represented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by the
15415. crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in
15416. on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a
15417. cannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon ball killed someone
15418. behind them, another fell in front and splashed Dolokhov with blood.
15419. The crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few
15420. steps, and again stopped.
15421. 
15422. "Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here another
15423. two minutes and it is certain death," thought each one.
15424. 
15425. Dolokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of
15426. the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the slippery
15427. ice that covered the millpool.
15428. 
15429. "Turn this way!" he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked under
15430. him; "turn this way!" he shouted to those with the gun. "It bears!..."
15431. 
15432. The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it
15433. would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon even
15434. under his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the
15435. bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the
15436. entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address
15437. Dolokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that
15438. everyone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general fell
15439. from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or thought of
15440. raising him.
15441. 
15442. "Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don't you hear? Go on!"
15443. innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the
15444. general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were
15445. shouting.
15446. 
15447. One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the
15448. ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond.
15449. The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped
15450. into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist.
15451. The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but
15452. from behind still came the shouts: "Onto the ice, why do you stop? Go
15453. on! Go on!" And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers
15454. near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and
15455. move on. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that had held under
15456. those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on
15457. it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another.
15458. 
15459. Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the
15460. ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered
15461. the dam, the pond, and the bank.
15462. 
15463. 
15464. 
15465. 
15466. 
15467. CHAPTER XIX
15468. 
15469. 
15470. On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his
15471. hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciously
15472. uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.
15473. 
15474. Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know
15475. how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was
15476. alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.
15477. 
15478. "Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw
15479. today?" was his first thought. "And I did not know this suffering
15480. either," he thought. "Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all till
15481. now. But where am I?"
15482. 
15483. He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices
15484. speaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same lofty
15485. sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and
15486. between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and did not
15487. see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up
15488. and stopped near him.
15489. 
15490. It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding
15491. over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries
15492. firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left
15493. on the field.
15494. 
15495. "Fine men!" remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier,
15496. who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his
15497. stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.
15498. 
15499. "The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your Majesty,"
15500. said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at
15501. Augesd.
15502. 
15503. "Have some brought from the reserve," said Napoleon, and having gone on
15504. a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with
15505. the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had already
15506. been taken by the French as a trophy.)
15507. 
15508. "That's a fine death!" said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkonski.
15509. 
15510. Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was
15511. Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he
15512. heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only
15513. did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once
15514. forgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death,
15515. and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it
15516. was Napoleon--his hero--but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a
15517. small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between
15518. himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it. At
15519. that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him, or
15520. what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing near
15521. him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to
15522. life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to
15523. understand it so differently. He collected all his strength, to stir and
15524. utter a sound. He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan
15525. which aroused his own pity.
15526. 
15527. "Ah! He is alive," said Napoleon. "Lift this young man up and carry him
15528. to the dressing station."
15529. 
15530. Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in
15531. hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.
15532. 
15533. Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the
15534. terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while
15535. being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.
15536. He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other
15537. wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital.
15538. During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look
15539. about him and even speak.
15540. 
15541. The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French
15542. convoy officer, who said rapidly: "We must halt here: the Emperor
15543. will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen
15544. prisoners."
15545. 
15546. "There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army, that
15547. he is probably tired of them," said another officer.
15548. 
15549. "All the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor
15550. Alexander's Guards," said the first one, indicating a Russian officer in
15551. the white uniform of the Horse Guards.
15552. 
15553. Bolkonski recognized Prince Repnin whom he had met in Petersburg
15554. society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of
15555. the Horse Guards.
15556. 
15557. Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.
15558. 
15559. "Which is the senior?" he asked, on seeing the prisoners.
15560. 
15561. They named the colonel, Prince Repnin.
15562. 
15563. "You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander's regiment of Horse
15564. Guards?" asked Napoleon.
15565. 
15566. "I commanded a squadron," replied Repnin.
15567. 
15568. "Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably," said Napoleon.
15569. 
15570. "The praise of a great commander is a soldier's highest reward," said
15571. Repnin.
15572. 
15573. "I bestow it with pleasure," said Napoleon. "And who is that young man
15574. beside you?"
15575. 
15576. Prince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen.
15577. 
15578. After looking at him Napoleon smiled.
15579. 
15580. "He's very young to come to meddle with us."
15581. 
15582. "Youth is no hindrance to courage," muttered Sukhtelen in a failing
15583. voice.
15584. 
15585. "A splendid reply!" said Napoleon. "Young man, you will go far!"
15586. 
15587. Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor's
15588. eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his
15589. attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield
15590. and, addressing him, again used the epithet "young man" that was
15591. connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.
15592. 
15593. "Well, and you, young man," said he. "How do you feel, mon brave?"
15594. 
15595. Though five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few
15596. words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed
15597. straight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment
15598. seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his
15599. hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear,
15600. compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and
15601. understood, that he could not answer him.
15602. 
15603. Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
15604. stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,
15605. suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into
15606. Napoleon's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of
15607. greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and
15608. the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one
15609. alive could understand or explain.
15610. 
15611. The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of
15612. the officers as he went: "Have these gentlemen attended to and taken
15613. to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds. Au revoir,
15614. Prince Repnin!" and he spurred his horse and galloped away.
15615. 
15616. His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.
15617. 
15618. The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the
15619. little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother's neck, but
15620. seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to
15621. return the holy image.
15622. 
15623. Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the
15624. little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest
15625. outside his uniform.
15626. 
15627. "It would be good," thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his
15628. sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, "it
15629. would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to
15630. Mary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life,
15631. and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I
15632. should be if I could now say: 'Lord, have mercy on me!'... But to whom
15633. should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible,
15634. which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in
15635. words--the Great All or Nothing-" said he to himself, "or to that God
15636. who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain,
15637. nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and
15638. the greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important."
15639. 
15640. The stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain;
15641. his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his father,
15642. wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night
15643. before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and
15644. above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious
15645. fancies.
15646. 
15647. The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented
15648. itself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that
15649. little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
15650. shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments
15651. had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward morning
15652. all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of
15653. unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleon's doctor,
15654. Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence.
15655. 
15656. "He is a nervous, bilious subject," said Larrey, "and will not recover."
15657. 
15658. And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of
15659. the inhabitants of the district.

15671. CHAPTER I
15672. 
15673. 
15674. Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostov returned home on leave. Denisov
15675. was going home to Voronezh and Rostov persuaded him to travel with him
15676. as far as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting a comrade at the
15677. last post station but one before Moscow, Denisov had drunk three bottles
15678. of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the snow-covered
15679. road, did not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay at the bottom
15680. of the sleigh beside Rostov, who grew more and more impatient the nearer
15681. they got to Moscow.
15682. 
15683. "How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,
15684. shops, bakers' signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!" thought Rostov,
15685. when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had
15686. entered Moscow.
15687. 
15688. "Denisov! We're here! He's asleep," he added, leaning forward with his
15689. whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the
15690. sleigh.
15691. 
15692. Denisov gave no answer.
15693. 
15694. "There's the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, Zakhar, has his
15695. stand, and there's Zakhar himself and still the same horse! And here's
15696. the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Can't you hurry up?
15697. Now then!"
15698. 
15699. "Which house is it?" asked the driver.
15700. 
15701. "Why, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don't you see? That's our
15702. house," said Rostov. "Of course, it's our house! Denisov, Denisov! We're
15703. almost there!"
15704. 
15705. Denisov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.
15706. 
15707. "Dmitri," said Rostov to his valet on the box, "those lights are in our
15708. house, aren't they?"
15709. 
15710. "Yes, sir, and there's a light in your father's study."
15711. 
15712. "Then they've not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now,
15713. don't forget to put out my new coat," added Rostov, fingering his new
15714. mustache. "Now then, get on," he shouted to the driver. "Do wake up,
15715. Vaska!" he went on, turning to Denisov, whose head was again nodding.
15716. "Come, get on! You shall have three rubles for vodka--get on!" Rostov
15717. shouted, when the sleigh was only three houses from his door. It seemed
15718. to him the horses were not moving at all. At last the sleigh bore to the
15719. right, drew up at an entrance, and Rostov saw overhead the old familiar
15720. cornice with a bit of plaster broken off, the porch, and the post by the
15721. side of the pavement. He sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran
15722. into the hall. The house stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless
15723. of who had come to it. There was no one in the hall. "Oh God! Is
15724. everyone all right?" he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking
15725. heart, and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the
15726. warped steps of the familiar staircase. The well-known old door handle,
15727. which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned,
15728. turned as loosely as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in the
15729. anteroom.
15730. 
15731. Old Michael was asleep on the chest. Prokofy, the footman, who was so
15732. strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat
15733. plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the opening
15734. door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one
15735. of delighted amazement.
15736. 
15737. "Gracious heavens! The young count!" he cried, recognizing his
15738. young master. "Can it be? My treasure!" and Prokofy, trembling with
15739. excitement, rushed toward the drawing-room door, probably in order to
15740. announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the
15741. young man's shoulder.
15742. 
15743. "All well?" asked Rostov, drawing away his arm.
15744. 
15745. "Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They've just finished supper. Let me have a
15746. look at you, your excellency."
15747. 
15748. "Is everything quite all right?"
15749. 
15750. "The Lord be thanked, yes!"
15751. 
15752. Rostov, who had completely forgotten Denisov, not wishing anyone to
15753. forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the
15754. large dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card
15755. tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had
15756. already seen the young master, and, before he had reached the drawing
15757. room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began
15758. hugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the same
15759. kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more kissing,
15760. more outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was
15761. Papa, which Natasha, and which Petya. Everyone shouted, talked, and
15762. kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not there, he noticed
15763. that.
15764. 
15765. "And I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!..."
15766. 
15767. "Here he is... our own... Kolya, * dear fellow... How he has changed!...
15768. Where are the candles?... Tea!..."
15769. 
15770. 
15771.     * Nicholas.
15772. 
15773. 
15774. "And me, kiss me!"
15775. 
15776. "Dearest... and me!"
15777. 
15778. Sonya, Natasha, Petya, Anna Mikhaylovna, Vera, and the old count were
15779. all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the room,
15780. exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.
15781. 
15782. Petya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, "And me too!"
15783. 
15784. Natasha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face
15785. with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang away and
15786. pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly.
15787. 
15788. All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around
15789. were lips seeking a kiss.
15790. 
15791. Sonya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss,
15792. looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she
15793. longed. Sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at
15794. this moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not taking
15795. her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave her a
15796. grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for someone. The old
15797. countess had not yet come. But now steps were heard at the door, steps
15798. so rapid that they could hardly be his mother's.
15799. 
15800. Yet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made since
15801. he had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her. When they
15802. met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her face, but
15803. only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar's jacket. Denisov,
15804. who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped
15805. his eyes at the sight.
15806. 
15807. "Vasili Denisov, your son's friend," he said, introducing himself to the
15808. count, who was looking inquiringly at him.
15809. 
15810. "You are most welcome! I know, I know," said the count, kissing and
15811. embracing Denisov. "Nicholas wrote us... Natasha, Vera, look! Here is
15812. Denisov!"
15813. 
15814. The same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of Denisov.
15815. 
15816. "Darling Denisov!" screamed Natasha, beside herself with rapture,
15817. springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This
15818. escapade made everybody feel confused. Denisov blushed too, but smiled
15819. and, taking Natasha's hand, kissed it.
15820. 
15821. Denisov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rostovs all
15822. gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.
15823. 
15824. The old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every
15825. moment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every
15826. movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring
15827. eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest
15828. to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea,
15829. handkerchief, and pipe.
15830. 
15831. Rostov was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first
15832. moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed
15833. insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.
15834. 
15835. Next morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept
15836. till ten o'clock.
15837. 
15838. In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers,
15839. satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly
15840. cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The servants
15841. were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their
15842. well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.
15843. 
15844. "Hallo, Gwiska--my pipe!" came Vasili Denisov's husky voice. "Wostov,
15845. get up!"
15846. 
15847. Rostov, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his
15848. disheveled head from the hot pillow.
15849. 
15850. "Why, is it late?"
15851. 
15852. "Late! It's nearly ten o'clock," answered Natasha's voice. A rustle of
15853. starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls' voices
15854. came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a crack and there was
15855. a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair, and merry faces.
15856. It was Natasha, Sonya, and Petya, who had come to see whether they were
15857. getting up.
15858. 
15859. "Nicholas! Get up!" Natasha's voice was again heard at the door.
15860. 
15861. "Directly!"
15862. 
15863. Meanwhile, Petya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer room,
15864. with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and
15865. forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed,
15866. opened the bedroom door.
15867. 
15868. "Is this your saber?" he shouted.
15869. 
15870. The girls sprang aside. Denisov hid his hairy legs under the blanket,
15871. looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door, having let
15872. Petya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from behind it.
15873. 
15874. "Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!" said Natasha's voice.
15875. 
15876. "Is this your saber?" asked Petya. "Or is it yours?" he said, addressing
15877. the black-mustached Denisov with servile deference.
15878. 
15879. Rostov hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing gown,
15880. and went out. Natasha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting
15881. her foot into the other. Sonya, when he came in, was twirling round and
15882. was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down. They were
15883. dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and
15884. bright. Sonya ran away, but Natasha, taking her brother's arm, led him
15885. into the sitting room, where they began talking. They hardly gave one
15886. another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand
15887. little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves. Natasha
15888. laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what
15889. they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable
15890. to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.
15891. 
15892. "Oh, how nice, how splendid!" she said to everything.
15893. 
15894. Rostov felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that
15895. childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left
15896. home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his
15897. soul and his face.
15898. 
15899. "No, but listen," she said, "now you are quite a man, aren't you? I'm
15900. awfully glad you're my brother." She touched his mustache. "I want to
15901. know what you men are like. Are you the same as we? No?"
15902. 
15903. "Why did Sonya run away?" asked Rostov.
15904. 
15905. "Ah, yes! That's a whole long story! How are you going to speak to
15906. her--thou or you?"
15907. 
15908. "As may happen," said Rostov.
15909. 
15910. "No, call her you, please! I'll tell you all about it some other time.
15911. No, I'll tell you now. You know Sonya's my dearest friend. Such a friend
15912. that I burned my arm for her sake. Look here!"
15913. 
15914. She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long,
15915. slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered
15916. even by a ball dress.
15917. 
15918. "I burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a ruler in the
15919. fire and pressed it there!"
15920. 
15921. Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what used
15922. to be his old schoolroom, and looking into Natasha's wildly bright eyes,
15923. Rostov re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning
15924. for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life; and the
15925. burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him
15926. senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it.
15927. 
15928. "Well, and is that all?" he asked.
15929. 
15930. "We are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just
15931. nonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does it
15932. for life, but I don't understand that, I forget quickly."
15933. 
15934. "Well, what then?"
15935. 
15936. "Well, she loves me and you like that."
15937. 
15938. Natasha suddenly flushed.
15939. 
15940. "Why, you remember before you went away?... Well, she says you are to
15941. forget all that.... She says: 'I shall love him always, but let him be
15942. free.' Isn't that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isn't it?" asked
15943. Natasha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she
15944. was now saying she had talked of before, with tears.
15945. 
15946. Rostov became thoughtful.
15947. 
15948. "I never go back on my word," he said. "Besides, Sonya is so charming
15949. that only a fool would renounce such happiness."
15950. 
15951. "No, no!" cried Natasha, "she and I have already talked it over. We knew
15952. you'd say so. But it won't do, because you see, if you say that--if you
15953. consider yourself bound by your promise--it will seem as if she had not
15954. meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying her because you
15955. must, and that wouldn't do at all."
15956. 
15957. Rostov saw that it had been well considered by them. Sonya had already
15958. struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when he had caught
15959. a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl
15960. of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt
15961. that for an instant). Why should he not love her now, and even marry
15962. her, Rostov thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures
15963. and interests before him! "Yes, they have taken a wise decision," he
15964. thought, "I must remain free."
15965. 
15966. "Well then, that's excellent," said he. "We'll talk it over later on.
15967. Oh, how glad I am to have you!"
15968. 
15969. "Well, and are you still true to Boris?" he continued.
15970. 
15971. "Oh, what nonsense!" cried Natasha, laughing. "I don't think about him
15972. or anyone else, and I don't want anything of the kind."
15973. 
15974. "Dear me! Then what are you up to now?"
15975. 
15976. "Now?" repeated Natasha, and a happy smile lit up her face. "Have you
15977. seen Duport?"
15978. 
15979. "No."
15980. 
15981. "Not seen Duport--the famous dancer? Well then, you won't understand.
15982. That's what I'm up to."
15983. 
15984. Curving her arms, Natasha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran back
15985. a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply
15986. together, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.
15987. 
15988. "See, I'm standing! See!" she said, but could not maintain herself on
15989. her toes any longer. "So that's what I'm up to! I'll never marry anyone,
15990. but will be a dancer. Only don't tell anyone."
15991. 
15992. Rostov laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov, in his bedroom, felt
15993. envious and Natasha could not help joining in.
15994. 
15995. "No, but don't you think it's nice?" she kept repeating.
15996. 
15997. "Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry Boris?"
15998. 
15999. Natasha flared up. "I don't want to marry anyone. And I'll tell him so
16000. when I see him!"
16001. 
16002. "Dear me!" said Rostov.
16003. 
16004. "But that's all rubbish," Natasha chattered on. "And is Denisov nice?"
16005. she asked.
16006. 
16007. "Yes, indeed!"
16008. 
16009. "Oh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible, Denisov?"
16010. 
16011. "Why terrible?" asked Nicholas. "No, Vaska is a splendid fellow."
16012. 
16013. "You call him Vaska? That's funny! And is he very nice?"
16014. 
16015. "Very."
16016. 
16017. "Well then, be quick. We'll all have breakfast together."
16018. 
16019. And Natasha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet
16020. dancer, but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile. When
16021. Rostov met Sonya in the drawing room, he reddened. He did not know how
16022. to behave with her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of
16023. meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not
16024. be done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was
16025. looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with
16026. her. He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you--Sonya.
16027. But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender kisses. Her looks
16028. asked him to forgive her for having dared, by Natasha's intermediacy, to
16029. remind him of his promise, and then thanked him for his love. His looks
16030. thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or
16031. another he would never cease to love her, for that would be impossible.
16032. 
16033. "How strange it is," said Vera, selecting a moment when all were silent,
16034. "that Sonya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet like
16035. strangers."
16036. 
16037. Vera's remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like most of
16038. her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not only Sonya,
16039. Nicholas, and Natasha, but even the old countess, who--dreading
16040. this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making a brilliant
16041. match--blushed like a girl.
16042. 
16043. Denisov, to Rostov's surprise, appeared in the drawing room with pomaded
16044. hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as he made
16045. himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the ladies
16046. and gentlemen than Rostov had ever expected to see him.
16047. 
16048. 
16049. 
16050. 
16051. 
16052. CHAPTER II
16053. 
16054. 
16055. On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rostov was welcomed
16056. by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling
16057. Nikolenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young
16058. man; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good
16059. dancer, and one of the best matches in the city.
16060. 
16061. The Rostovs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money enough
16062. that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,
16063. acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the
16064. latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the
16065. latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,
16066. passed his time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself
16067. to the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be
16068. at home again. He felt that he had grown up and matured very much. His
16069. despair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money from
16070. Gavril to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing Sonya on the sly--he now
16071. recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind.
16072. Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and
16073. wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers for bravery in
16074. action, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected racing
16075. men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a lady on one
16076. of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the mazurka at
16077. the Arkharovs' ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal Kamenski,
16078. visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with a colonel of
16079. forty to whom Denisov had introduced him.
16080. 
16081. His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But still, as
16082. he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke
16083. about him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he
16084. had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the
16085. Emperor not everyone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared
16086. the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of
16087. as the "angel incarnate."
16088. 
16089. During Rostov's short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he did
16090. not draw closer to Sonya, but rather drifted away from her. She was very
16091. pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was at
16092. the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time
16093. for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes
16094. his freedom which he needs for so many other things. When he thought of
16095. Sonya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself, "Ah, there will
16096. be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom I do not yet
16097. know. There will be time enough to think about love when I want to, but
16098. now I have no time." Besides, it seemed to him that the society of women
16099. was rather derogatory to his manhood. He went to balls and into ladies'
16100. society with an affectation of doing so against his will. The races, the
16101. English Club, sprees with Denisov, and visits to a certain house--that
16102. was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar!
16103. 
16104. At the beginning of March, old Count Ilya Rostov was very busy arranging
16105. a dinner in honor of Prince Bagration at the English Club.
16106. 
16107. The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving
16108. orders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktist, the Club's head
16109. cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and fish
16110. for this dinner. The count had been a member and on the committee of
16111. the Club from the day it was founded. To him the Club entrusted the
16112. arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagration, for few men knew so
16113. well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale, and
16114. still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of
16115. their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete.
16116. The club cook and the steward listened to the count's orders with
16117. pleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could they
16118. so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing
16119. several thousand rubles.
16120. 
16121. "Well then, mind and have cocks' comb in the turtle soup, you know!"
16122. 
16123. "Shall we have three cold dishes then?" asked the cook.
16124. 
16125. The count considered.
16126. 
16127. "We can't have less--yes, three... the mayonnaise, that's one," said he,
16128. bending down a finger.
16129. 
16130. "Then am I to order those large sterlets?" asked the steward.
16131. 
16132. "Yes, it can't be helped if they won't take less. Ah, dear me! I was
16133. forgetting. We must have another entree. Ah, goodness gracious!" he
16134. clutched at his head. "Who is going to get me the flowers? Dmitri! Eh,
16135. Dmitri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate," he said to the factotum who
16136. appeared at his call. "Hurry off and tell Maksim, the gardener, to set
16137. the serfs to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must be
16138. brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred pots here
16139. on Friday."
16140. 
16141. Having given several more orders, he was about to go to his "little
16142. countess" to have a rest, but remembering something else of importance,
16143. he returned again, called back the cook and the club steward, and again
16144. began giving orders. A light footstep and the clinking of spurs were
16145. heard at the door, and the young count, handsome, rosy, with a dark
16146. little mustache, evidently rested and made sleeker by his easy life in
16147. Moscow, entered the room.
16148. 
16149. "Ah, my boy, my head's in a whirl!" said the old man with a smile, as if
16150. he felt a little confused before his son. "Now, if you would only help
16151. a bit! I must have singers too. I shall have my own orchestra, but
16152. shouldn't we get the gypsy singers as well? You military men like that
16153. sort of thing."
16154. 
16155. "Really, Papa, I believe Prince Bagration worried himself less before
16156. the battle of Schon Grabern than you do now," said his son with a smile.
16157. 
16158. The old count pretended to be angry.
16159. 
16160. "Yes, you talk, but try it yourself!"
16161. 
16162. And the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and respectful
16163. expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and
16164. son.
16165. 
16166. "What have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feoktist?" said he.
16167. "Laughing at us old fellows!"
16168. 
16169. "That's so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good
16170. dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, that's not their
16171. business!"
16172. 
16173. "That's it, that's it!" exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing his son
16174. by both hands, he cried, "Now I've got you, so take the sleigh and pair
16175. at once, and go to Bezukhov's, and tell him 'Count Ilya has sent you
16176. to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples.' We can't get them from
16177. anyone else. He's not there himself, so you'll have to go in and ask the
16178. princesses; and from there go on to the Rasgulyay--the coachman Ipatka
16179. knows--and look up the gypsy Ilyushka, the one who danced at Count
16180. Orlov's, you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and bring him along to
16181. me."
16182. 
16183. "And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?" asked Nicholas,
16184. laughing. "Dear, dear!..."
16185. 
16186. At that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike,
16187. preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna
16188. Mikhaylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count in his
16189. dressing gown every day, he invariably became confused and begged her to
16190. excuse his costume.
16191. 
16192. "No matter at all, my dear count," she said, meekly closing her eyes.
16193. "But I'll go to Bezukhov's myself. Pierre has arrived, and now we shall
16194. get anything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him in any case.
16195. He has forwarded me a letter from Boris. Thank God, Boris is now on the
16196. staff."
16197. 
16198. The count was delighted at Anna Mikhaylovna's taking upon herself one of
16199. his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.
16200. 
16201. "Tell Bezukhov to come. I'll put his name down. Is his wife with him?"
16202. he asked.
16203. 
16204. Anna Mikhaylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was depicted
16205. on her face.
16206. 
16207. "Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate," she said. "If what we hear
16208. is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing when we
16209. were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul as young
16210. Bezukhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give him what
16211. consolation I can."
16212. 
16213. "Wh-what is the matter?" asked both the young and old Rostov.
16214. 
16215. Anna Mikhaylovna sighed deeply.
16216. 
16217. "Dolokhov, Mary Ivanovna's son," she said in a mysterious whisper, "has
16218. compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him up, invited him to
16219. his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here and that daredevil
16220. after her!" said Anna Mikhaylovna, wishing to show her sympathy for
16221. Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her
16222. sympathy for the "daredevil," as she called Dolokhov. "They say Pierre
16223. is quite broken by his misfortune."
16224. 
16225. "Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the Club--it will all blow
16226. over. It will be a tremendous banquet."
16227. 
16228. Next day, the third of March, soon after one o'clock, two hundred and
16229. fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the
16230. guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince Bagration, to
16231. dinner.
16232. 
16233. On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow had
16234. been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to victories
16235. that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it,
16236. while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an
16237. event. In the English Club, where all who were distinguished, important,
16238. and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in
16239. December, nothing was said about the war and the last battle, as
16240. though all were in a conspiracy of silence. The men who set the tone in
16241. conversation--Count Rostopchin, Prince Yuri Dolgorukov, Valuev, Count
16242. Markov, and Prince Vyazemski--did not show themselves at the Club, but
16243. met in private houses in intimate circles, and the Moscovites who took
16244. their opinions from others--Ilya Rostov among them--remained for a
16245. while without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without
16246. leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to
16247. discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best to be silent.
16248. But after a while, just as a jury comes out of its room, the bigwigs
16249. who guided the Club's opinion reappeared, and everybody began speaking
16250. clearly and definitely. Reasons were found for the incredible,
16251. unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat, everything became
16252. clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things began to be
16253. said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a defective
16254. commissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebyszewski and of the
16255. Frenchman Langeron, Kutuzov's incapacity, and (it was whispered) the
16256. youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless and
16257. insignificant people. But the army, the Russian army, everyone declared,
16258. was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor. The soldiers,
16259. officers, and generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was Prince
16260. Bagration, distinguished by his Schon Grabern affair and by the retreat
16261. from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and
16262. had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own.
16263. What also conduced to Bagration's being selected as Moscow's hero was
16264. the fact that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger
16265. there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian
16266. soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated
16267. by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suvorov.
16268. Moreover, paying such honor to Bagration was the best way of expressing
16269. disapproval and dislike of Kutuzov.
16270. 
16271. "Had there been no Bagration, it would have been necessary to invent
16272. him," said the wit Shinshin, parodying the words of Voltaire. Kutuzov
16273. no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers, calling him a
16274. court weathercock and an old satyr.
16275. 
16276. All Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorukov's saying: "If you go on modeling
16277. and modeling you must get smeared with clay," suggesting consolation
16278. for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and the words of
16279. Rostopchin, that French soldiers have to be incited to battle by
16280. highfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to show them that it
16281. is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but that Russian soldiers
16282. only need to be restrained and held back! On all sides, new and fresh
16283. anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our
16284. officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another had
16285. killed five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded. Berg
16286. was mentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when wounded
16287. in the right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone forward. Of
16288. Bolkonski, nothing was said, and only those who knew him intimately
16289. regretted that he had died so young, leaving a pregnant wife with his
16290. eccentric father.
16291. 
16292. 
16293. 
16294. 
16295. 
16296. CHAPTER III
16297. 
16298. 
16299. On that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club were filled
16300. with a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in springtime.
16301. The members and guests of the Club wandered hither and thither, sat,
16302. stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress,
16303. and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftans.
16304. Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings,
16305. stood at every door anxiously noting visitors' every movement in order
16306. to offer their services. Most of those present were elderly, respected
16307. men with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures
16308. and voices. This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual
16309. places and met in certain habitual groups. A minority of those present
16310. were casual guests--chiefly young men, among whom were Denisov, Rostov,
16311. and Dolokhov--who was now again an officer in the Semenov regiment. The
16312. faces of these young people, especially those who were military men,
16313. bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which
16314. seems to say to the older generation, "We are prepared to respect and
16315. honor you, but all the same remember that the future belongs to us."
16316. 
16317. Nesvitski was there as an old member of the Club. Pierre, who at his
16318. wife's command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles, went
16319. about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull. Here, as
16320. elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his
16321. wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people, he
16322. treated them with absent-minded contempt.
16323. 
16324. By his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his wealth
16325. and connections he belonged to the groups old and honored guests, and
16326. so he went from one group to another. Some of the most important old men
16327. were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully
16328. to hear the voices of well-known men. The largest circles formed round
16329. Count Rostopchin, Valuev, and Naryshkin. Rostopchin was describing how
16330. the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to
16331. force their way through them with bayonets.
16332. 
16333. Valuev was confidentially telling that Uvarov had been sent from
16334. Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.
16335. 
16336. In the third circle, Naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the
16337. Austrian Council of War at which Suvorov crowed like a cock in reply to
16338. the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. Shinshin, standing close
16339. by, tried to make a joke, saying that Kutuzov had evidently failed to
16340. learn from Suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a
16341. cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him
16342. feel that in that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of
16343. Kutuzov.
16344. 
16345. Count Ilya Rostov, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft boots
16346. between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the important and
16347. unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all equals, while his
16348. eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up young son, resting
16349. on him and winking joyfully at him. Young Rostov stood at a window with
16350. Dolokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued. The
16351. old count came up to them and pressed Dolokhov's hand.
16352. 
16353. "Please come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been together out
16354. there... both playing the hero... Ah, Vasili Ignatovich... How d'ye do,
16355. old fellow?" he said, turning to an old man who was passing, but before
16356. he had finished his greeting there was a general stir, and a footman who
16357. had run in announced, with a frightened face: "He's arrived!"
16358. 
16359. Bells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and--like rye shaken together
16360. in a shovel--the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms
16361. came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the
16362. ballroom.
16363. 
16364. Bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword,
16365. which, in accord with the Club custom, he had given up to the hall
16366. porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip
16367. over his shoulder, as when Rostov had seen him on the eve of the battle
16368. of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign
16369. Orders, and the Star of St. George on his left breast. Evidently just
16370. before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed,
16371. which changed his appearance for the worse. There was something naively
16372. festive in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile
16373. features, gave him a rather comical expression. Bekleshev and Theodore
16374. Uvarov, who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him,
16375. as the guest of honor, to enter first. Bagration was embarrassed, not
16376. wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay
16377. at the doors, but after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly
16378. and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing
16379. what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed
16380. field under fire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at
16381. Schon Grabern--and he would have found that easier. The committeemen
16382. met him at the first door and, expressing their delight at seeing such a
16383. highly honored guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting
16384. for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It was
16385. at first impossible to enter the drawing-room door for the crowd of
16386. members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at
16387. Bagration over each other's shoulders, as if he were some rare animal.
16388. Count Ilya Rostov, laughing and repeating the words, "Make way, dear
16389. boy! Make way, make way!" pushed through the crowd more energetically
16390. than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and seated them on
16391. the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members of the Club,
16392. beset the new arrivals. Count Ilya, again thrusting his way through the
16393. crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with
16394. another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver which he presented
16395. to Prince Bagration. On the salver lay some verses composed and printed
16396. in the hero's honor. Bagration, on seeing the salver, glanced around
16397. in dismay, as though seeking help. But all eyes demanded that he should
16398. submit. Feeling himself in their power, he resolutely took the salver
16399. with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who
16400. had presented it to him. Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagration
16401. (or he would, it seemed, have held it till evening and have gone in to
16402. dinner with it) and drew his attention to the verses.
16403. 
16404. "Well, I will read them, then!" Bagration seemed to say, and, fixing
16405. his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and serious
16406. expression. But the author himself took the verses and began reading
16407. them aloud. Bagration bowed his head and listened:
16408. 
16409.    Bring glory then to Alexander's reign
16410.    And on the throne our Titus shield.
16411.    A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,
16412.    A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!
16413.    E'en fortunate Napoleon
16414.    Knows by experience, now, Bagration,
16415.    And dare not Herculean Russians trouble...
16416. 
16417. But before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced
16418. that dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the dining room came
16419. the resounding strains of the polonaise:
16420. 
16421.    Conquest's joyful thunder waken,
16422.    Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...
16423. 
16424. and Count Rostov, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his
16425. verses, bowed to Bagration. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was more
16426. important than verses, and Bagration, again preceding all the rest,
16427. went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between two
16428. Alexanders--Bekleshev and Naryshkin--which was a significant allusion to
16429. the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took their seats in the
16430. dining room, according to their rank and importance: the more important
16431. nearer to the honored guest, as naturally as water flows deepest where
16432. the land lies lowest.
16433. 
16434. Just before dinner, Count Ilya Rostov presented his son to Bagration,
16435. who recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward,
16436. as were all the words he spoke that day, and Count Ilya looked joyfully
16437. and proudly around while Bagration spoke to his son.
16438. 
16439. Nicholas Rostov, with Denisov and his new acquaintance, Dolokhov, sat
16440. almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince
16441. Nesvitski. Count Ilya Rostov with the other members of the committee sat
16442. facing Bagration and, as the very personification of Moscow hospitality,
16443. did the honors to the prince.
16444. 
16445. His efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and the
16446. other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the
16447. end of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions to the
16448. footmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety. Everything
16449. was excellent. With the second course, a gigantic sterlet (at sight of
16450. which Ilya Rostov blushed with self-conscious pleasure), the footmen
16451. began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses. After the fish,
16452. which made a certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with the
16453. other committeemen. "There will be many toasts, it's time to begin," he
16454. whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose. All were silent, waiting
16455. for what he would say.
16456. 
16457. "To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!" he cried, and at the same
16458. moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm. The
16459. band immediately struck up "Conquest's joyful thunder waken..." All rose
16460. and cried "Hurrah!" Bagration also rose and shouted "Hurrah!" in exactly
16461. the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schon Grabern.
16462. Young Rostov's ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred
16463. others. He nearly wept. "To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!"
16464. he roared, "Hurrah!" and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to
16465. the floor. Many followed his example, and the loud shouting continued
16466. for a long time. When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the
16467. broken glass and everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had
16468. made and exchanging remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a
16469. note lying beside his plate, and proposed a toast, "To the health of the
16470. hero of our last campaign, Prince Peter Ivanovich Bagration!" and again
16471. his blue eyes grew moist. "Hurrah!" cried the three hundred voices
16472. again, but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed
16473. by Paul Ivanovich Kutuzov:
16474. 
16475.    Russians! O'er all barriers on!
16476.    Courage conquest guarantees;
16477.    Have we not Bagration?
16478.    He brings foe men to their knees,... etc.
16479. 
16480. 
16481. As soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was proposed
16482. and Count Ilya Rostov became more and more moved, more glass was
16483. smashed, and the shouting grew louder. They drank to Bekleshev,
16484. Naryshkin, Uvarov, Dolgorukov, Apraksin, Valuev, to the committee, to
16485. all the Club members and to all the Club guests, and finally to Count
16486. Ilya Rostov separately, as the organizer of the banquet. At that
16487. toast, the count took out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept
16488. outright.
16489. 
16490. 
16491. 
16492. 
16493. 
16494. CHAPTER IV
16495. 
16496. 
16497. Pierre sat opposite Dolokhov and Nicholas Rostov. As usual, he ate and
16498. drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed that
16499. some great change had come over him that day. He was silent all through
16500. dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and
16501. a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his
16502. nose. His face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear
16503. nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some
16504. depressing and unsolved problem.
16505. 
16506. The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the
16507. princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning Dolokhov's intimacy with his
16508. wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which in
16509. the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly
16510. through his spectacles, but that his wife's connection with Dolokhov was
16511. a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the
16512. princess' hints and the letter, but he feared now to look at Dolokhov,
16513. who was sitting opposite him. Every time he chanced to meet Dolokhov's
16514. handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous
16515. rising in his soul and turned quickly away. Involuntarily recalling his
16516. wife's past and her relations with Dolokhov, Pierre saw clearly that
16517. what was said in the letter might be true, or might at least seem to be
16518. true had it not referred to his wife. He involuntarily remembered
16519. how Dolokhov, who had fully recovered his former position after the
16520. campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come to him. Availing himself
16521. of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion, Dolokhov
16522. had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put him up and lent him
16523. money. Pierre recalled how Helene had smilingly expressed disapproval of
16524. Dolokhov's living at their house, and how cynically Dolokhov had praised
16525. his wife's beauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had
16526. not left them for a day.
16527. 
16528. "Yes, he is very handsome," thought Pierre, "and I know him. It would be
16529. particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me, just
16530. because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him, and helped
16531. him. I know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure
16532. of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true, but I
16533. do not believe it. I have no right to, and can't, believe it." He
16534. remembered the expression Dolokhov's face assumed in his moments of
16535. cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into
16536. the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason,
16537. or shot a post-boy's horse with a pistol. That expression was often
16538. on Dolokhov's face when looking at him. "Yes, he is a bully," thought
16539. Pierre, "to kill a man means nothing to him. It must seem to him that
16540. everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him. He must think that
16541. I, too, am afraid of him--and in fact I am afraid of him," he thought,
16542. and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul.
16543. Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov were now sitting opposite Pierre and
16544. seemed very gay. Rostov was talking merrily to his two friends, one of
16545. whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and
16546. rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose
16547. preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very noticeable one
16548. at the dinner. Rostov looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre
16549. appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a
16550. beauty, and in a word--an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his
16551. preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostov and had
16552. not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor's health was drunk,
16553. Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.
16554. 
16555. "What are you about?" shouted Rostov, looking at him in an ecstasy of
16556. exasperation. "Don't you hear it's His Majesty the Emperor's health?"
16557. 
16558. Pierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till
16559. all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rostov.
16560. 
16561. "Why, I didn't recognize you!" he said. But Rostov was otherwise
16562. engaged; he was shouting "Hurrah!"
16563. 
16564. "Why don't you renew the acquaintance?" said Dolokhov to Rostov.
16565. 
16566. "Confound him, he's a fool!" said Rostov.
16567. 
16568. "One should make up to the husbands of pretty women," said Denisov.
16569. 
16570. Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking
16571. about him. He reddened and turned away.
16572. 
16573. "Well, now to the health of handsome women!" said Dolokhov, and with
16574. a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his
16575. mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.
16576. 
16577. "Here's to the health of lovely women, Peterkin--and their lovers!" he
16578. added.
16579. 
16580. Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at
16581. Dolokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets
16582. with Kutuzov's cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the principal
16583. guests. He was just going to take it when Dolokhov, leaning across,
16584. snatched it from his hand and began reading it. Pierre looked at
16585. Dolokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and monstrous that
16586. had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him. He
16587. leaned his whole massive body across the table.
16588. 
16589. "How dare you take it?" he shouted.
16590. 
16591. Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvitski and the
16592. neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezukhov.
16593. 
16594. "Don't! Don't! What are you about?" whispered their frightened voices.
16595. 
16596. Dolokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that
16597. smile of his which seemed to say, "Ah! This is what I like!"
16598. 
16599. "You shan't have it!" he said distinctly.
16600. 
16601. Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.
16602. 
16603. "You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!" he ejaculated, and, pushing
16604. back his chair, he rose from the table.
16605. 
16606. At the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt
16607. that the question of his wife's guilt which had been tormenting him the
16608. whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative. He
16609. hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite Denisov's request
16610. that he would take no part in the matter, Rostov agreed to be Dolokhov's
16611. second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with
16612. Nesvitski, Bezukhov's second. Pierre went home, but Rostov with Dolokhov
16613. and Denisov stayed on at the Club till late, listening to the gypsies
16614. and other singers.
16615. 
16616. "Well then, till tomorrow at Sokolniki," said Dolokhov, as he took leave
16617. of Rostov in the Club porch.
16618. 
16619. "And do you feel quite calm?" Rostov asked.
16620. 
16621. Dolokhov paused.
16622. 
16623. "Well, you see, I'll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two
16624. words. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write
16625. affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be
16626. killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm
16627. intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and
16628. then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostroma used to tell
16629. me. 'Everyone fears a bear,' he says, 'but when you see one your fear's
16630. all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!' And that's
16631. how it is with me. A demain, mon cher." *
16632. 
16633. 
16634.     * Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.
16635. 
16636. 
16637. Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvitski drove to the
16638. Sokolniki forest and found Dolokhov, Denisov, and Rostov already there.
16639. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no
16640. connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow. He had
16641. evidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and screwed
16642. up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed by two
16643. considerations: his wife's guilt, of which after his sleepless night he
16644. had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of Dolokhov, who had
16645. no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him.... "I
16646. should perhaps have done the same thing in his place," thought Pierre.
16647. "It's even certain that I should have done the same, then why this duel,
16648. this murder? Either I shall kill him, or he will hit me in the head,
16649. or elbow, or knee. Can't I go away from here, run away, bury myself
16650. somewhere?" passed through his mind. But just at moments when such
16651. thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a particularly calm and
16652. absent-minded way, which inspired the respect of the onlookers, "Will it
16653. be long? Are things ready?"
16654. 
16655. When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers,
16656. and the pistols loaded, Nesvitski went up to Pierre.
16657. 
16658. "I should not be doing my duty, Count," he said in timid tones, "and
16659. should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in
16660. choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very grave, moment I
16661. did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no sufficient ground
16662. for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it.... You were not right,
16663. not quite in the right, you were impetuous..."
16664. 
16665. "Oh yes, it is horribly stupid," said Pierre.
16666. 
16667. "Then allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent
16668. will accept them," said Nesvitski (who like the others concerned in the
16669. affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that the
16670. affair had come to an actual duel). "You know, Count, it is much more
16671. honorable to admit one's mistake than to let matters become irreparable.
16672. There was no insult on either side. Allow me to convey...."
16673. 
16674. "No! What is there to talk about?" said Pierre. "It's all the same....
16675. Is everything ready?" he added. "Only tell me where to go and where to
16676. shoot," he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.
16677. 
16678. He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the
16679. trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his hand--a fact that he
16680. did not wish to confess.
16681. 
16682. "Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot," said he.
16683. 
16684. "No apologies, none whatever," said Dolokhov to Denisov (who on his
16685. side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to the
16686. appointed place.
16687. 
16688. The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road,
16689. where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest
16690. covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the
16691. last few days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther
16692. edge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in
16693. the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and
16694. Nesvitski's and Dolokhov's sabers, which were stuck into the ground
16695. ten paces apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and misty; at forty
16696. paces' distance nothing could be seen. For three minutes all had been
16697. ready, but they still delayed and all were silent.
16698. 
16699. 
16700. 
16701. 
16702. 
16703. CHAPTER V
16704. 
16705. 
16706. "Well begin!" said Dolokhov.
16707. 
16708. "All right," said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling of
16709. dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly begun
16710. could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of
16711. men's will.
16712. 
16713. Denisov first went to the barrier and announced: "As the adve'sawies
16714. have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your pistols, and at
16715. the word thwee begin to advance.
16716. 
16717. "O-ne! T-wo! Thwee!" he shouted angrily and stepped aside.
16718. 
16719. The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to
16720. one another, beginning to see one another through the mist. They had the
16721. right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier. Dolokhov
16722. walked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his
16723. bright, sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist's face. His mouth wore
16724. its usual semblance of a smile.
16725. 
16726. "So I can fire when I like!" said Pierre, and at the word "three," he
16727. went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and stepping into
16728. the deep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at arm's length,
16729. apparently afraid of shooting himself with it. His left hand he held
16730. carefully back, because he wished to support his right hand with it and
16731. knew he must not do so. Having advanced six paces and strayed off
16732. the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet, then quickly
16733. glanced at Dolokhov and, bending his finger as he had been shown, fired.
16734. Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered at the sound and
16735. then, smiling at his own sensations, stood still. The smoke, rendered
16736. denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing anything for an instant,
16737. but there was no second report as he had expected. He only heard
16738. Dolokhov's hurried steps, and his figure came in view through the smoke.
16739. He was pressing one hand to his left side, while the other clutched
16740. his drooping pistol. His face was pale. Rostov ran toward him and said
16741. something.
16742. 
16743. "No-o-o!" muttered Dolokhov through his teeth, "no, it's not over." And
16744. after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber, he sank
16745. on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped it on his
16746. coat and supported himself with it. His frowning face was pallid and
16747. quivered.
16748. 
16749. "Plea..." began Dolokhov, but could not at first pronounce the word.
16750. 
16751. "Please," he uttered with an effort.
16752. 
16753. Pierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward Dolokhov and
16754. was about to cross the space between the barriers, when Dolokhov cried:
16755. 
16756. "To your barrier!" and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by his
16757. saber. Only ten paces divided them. Dolokhov lowered his head to the
16758. snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself, drew
16759. in his legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He sucked and
16760. swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still smiling,
16761. glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining
16762. strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.
16763. 
16764. "Sideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!" ejaculated Nesvitski.
16765. 
16766. "Cover yourself!" even Denisov cried to his adversary.
16767. 
16768. Pierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs
16769. helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing
16770. Dolokhov looked sorrowfully at him. Denisov, Rostov, and Nesvitski
16771. closed their eyes. At the same instant they heard a report and
16772. Dolokhov's angry cry.
16773. 
16774. "Missed!" shouted Dolokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards on the
16775. snow.
16776. 
16777. Pierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,
16778. trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:
16779. 
16780. "Folly... folly! Death... lies..." he repeated, puckering his face.
16781. 
16782. Nesvitski stopped him and took him home.
16783. 
16784. Rostov and Denisov drove away with the wounded Dolokhov.
16785. 
16786. The latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer
16787. a word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering Moscow he
16788. suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took Rostov, who
16789. was sitting beside him, by the hand. Rostov was struck by the totally
16790. altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on Dolokhov's
16791. face.
16792. 
16793. "Well? How do you feel?" he asked.
16794. 
16795. "Bad! But it's not that, my friend-" said Dolokhov with a gasping voice.
16796. "Where are we? In Moscow, I know. I don't matter, but I have killed her,
16797. killed... She won't get over it! She won't survive...."
16798. 
16799. "Who?" asked Rostov.
16800. 
16801. "My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother," and Dolokhov
16802. pressed Rostov's hand and burst into tears.
16803. 
16804. When he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rostov that he was
16805. living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it.
16806. He implored Rostov to go on and prepare her.
16807. 
16808. Rostov went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise
16809. learned that Dolokhov the brawler, Dolokhov the bully, lived in Moscow
16810. with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate
16811. of sons and brothers.
16812. 
16813. 
16814. 
16815. 
16816. 
16817. CHAPTER VI
16818. 
16819. 
16820. Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in
16821. Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the
16822. duel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his
16823. father's room, that huge room in which Count Bezukhov had died.
16824. 
16825. He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that
16826. had happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings,
16827. thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall
16828. asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the
16829. room with rapid steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early days of
16830. their marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on
16831. her face, and then immediately he saw beside her Dolokhov's handsome,
16832. insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and
16833. then that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when
16834. he reeled and sank on the snow.
16835. 
16836. "What has happened?" he asked himself. "I have killed her lover, yes,
16837. killed my wife's lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come to do
16838. it?"--"Because you married her," answered an inner voice.
16839. 
16840. "But in what was I to blame?" he asked. "In marrying her without loving
16841. her; in deceiving yourself and her." And he vividly recalled that moment
16842. after supper at Prince Vasili's, when he spoke those words he had found
16843. so difficult to utter: "I love you." "It all comes from that! Even then
16844. I felt it," he thought. "I felt then that it was not so, that I had no
16845. right to do it. And so it turns out."
16846. 
16847. He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.
16848. Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of
16849. how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his
16850. study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head
16851. steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at
16852. his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing respectful
16853. understanding of his employer's happiness.
16854. 
16855. "But how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty
16856. and social tact," thought he; "been proud of my house, in which she
16857. received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty. So
16858. this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did not understand
16859. her. How often when considering her character I have told myself that
16860. I was to blame for not understanding her, for not understanding that
16861. constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires,
16862. and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved
16863. woman. Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become
16864. clear.
16865. 
16866. "Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her
16867. naked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be
16868. kissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied
16869. with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: 'Let him
16870. do what he pleases,' she used to say of me. One day I asked her if she
16871. felt any symptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said she
16872. was not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going to
16873. have any children by me."
16874. 
16875. Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the
16876. vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had
16877. been brought up in the most aristocratic circles.
16878. 
16879. "I'm not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous promener," *
16880. she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with young and old men
16881. and women Pierre could not understand why he did not love her.
16882. 
16883. 
16884.     * "You clear out of this."
16885. 
16886. 
16887. "Yes, I never loved her," said he to himself; "I knew she was a depraved
16888. woman," he repeated, "but dared not admit it to myself. And now there's
16889. Dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying,
16890. while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado!"
16891. 
16892. Pierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of what
16893. is called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their troubles. He
16894. digested his sufferings alone.
16895. 
16896. "It is all, all her fault," he said to himself; "but what of that? Why
16897. did I bind myself to her? Why did I say 'Je vous aime' * to her, which
16898. was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must endure... what?
16899. A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that's nonsense," he
16900. thought. "The slur on my name and honor--that's all apart from myself."
16901. 
16902. 
16903.     * I love you.
16904. 
16905. 
16906. "Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a
16907. criminal," came into Pierre's head, "and from their point of view they
16908. were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr's
16909. death for his sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot.
16910. Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are alive--live:
16911. tomorrow you'll die as I might have died an hour ago. And is it worth
16912. tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life in comparison
16913. with eternity?"
16914. 
16915. But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections,
16916. she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had
16917. most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the
16918. blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break
16919. and tear whatever came to his hand. "Why did I tell her that 'Je vous
16920. aime'?" he kept repeating to himself. And when he had said it for the
16921. tenth time, Molibre's words: "Mais que diable alloit-il faire dans cette
16922. galere?" occurred to him, and he began to laugh at himself.
16923. 
16924. In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
16925. Petersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He
16926. resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
16927. intention to part from her forever.
16928. 
16929. Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pierre
16930. was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.
16931. 
16932. He woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression,
16933. unable to realize where he was.
16934. 
16935. "The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home,"
16936. said the valet.
16937. 
16938. But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess
16939. herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with
16940. simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like
16941. a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was
16942. a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow. With her
16943. imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet.
16944. She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it. She waited till the
16945. valet had set down the coffee things and left the room. Pierre looked
16946. at her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds
16947. who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her
16948. enemies, he tried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless
16949. and impossible, he again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down
16950. but looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to
16951. go.
16952. 
16953. "Well, what's this now? What have you been up to now, I should like to
16954. know?" she asked sternly.
16955. 
16956. "I? What have I...?" stammered Pierre.
16957. 
16958. "So it seems you're a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about? What
16959. is it meant to prove? What? I ask you."
16960. 
16961. Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but
16962. could not reply.
16963. 
16964. "If you won't answer, I'll tell you..." Helene went on. "You believe
16965. everything you're told. You were told..." Helene laughed, "that Dolokhov
16966. was my lover," she said in French with her coarse plainness of speech,
16967. uttering the word amant as casually as any other word, "and you believed
16968. it! Well, what have you proved? What does this duel prove? That you're
16969. a fool, que vous etes un sot, but everybody knew that. What will be the
16970. result? That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow, that everyone
16971. will say that you, drunk and not knowing what you were about, challenged
16972. a man you are jealous of without cause." Helene raised her voice and
16973. became more and more excited, "A man who's a better man than you in
16974. every way..."
16975. 
16976. "Hm... Hm...!" growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and not
16977. moving a muscle.
16978. 
16979. "And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like his
16980. company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer
16981. yours."
16982. 
16983. "Don't speak to me... I beg you," muttered Pierre hoarsely.
16984. 
16985. "Why shouldn't I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you plainly
16986. that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not
16987. have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so," said she.
16988. 
16989. Pierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange
16990. expression she did not understand, and lay down again. He was suffering
16991. physically at that moment, there was a weight on his chest and he could
16992. not breathe. He knew that he must do something to put an end to this
16993. suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible.
16994. 
16995. "We had better separate," he muttered in a broken voice.
16996. 
16997. "Separate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune," said Helene.
16998. "Separate! That's a thing to frighten me with!"
16999. 
17000. Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.
17001. 
17002. "I'll kill you!" he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table
17003. with a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her
17004. brandishing the slab.
17005. 
17006. Helene's face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His
17007. father's nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and
17008. delight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping down
17009. on her with outstretched hands shouted, "Get out!" in such a terrible
17010. voice that the whole house heard it with horror. God knows what he would
17011. have done at that moment had Helene not fled from the room.
17012. 
17013. 
17014. A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates
17015. in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left
17016. for Petersburg alone.
17017. 
17018. 
17019. 
17020. 
17021. 
17022. CHAPTER VII
17023. 
17024. 
17025. Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and
17026. the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of the
17027. letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had
17028. not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What was worst of
17029. all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of
17030. his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the
17031. place and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among
17032. strangers and unable to send news of himself. The gazettes from which
17033. the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual
17034. very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians
17035. had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The
17036. old prince understood from this official report that our army had been
17037. defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz
17038. came a letter from Kutuzov informing the prince of the fate that had
17039. befallen his son.
17040. 
17041. "Your son," wrote Kutuzov, "fell before my eyes, a standard in his hand
17042. and at the head of a regiment--he fell as a hero, worthy of his father
17043. and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the whole army
17044. it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort myself and
17045. you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he would have
17046. been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle, a list
17047. of whom has been sent me under flag of truce."
17048. 
17049. After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his
17050. study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he
17051. was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though
17052. he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.
17053. 
17054. When Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his
17055. lathe and, as usual, did not look round at her.
17056. 
17057. "Ah, Princess Mary!" he said suddenly in an unnatural voice, throwing
17058. down his chisel. (The wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus,
17059. and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel, which
17060. merged in her memory with what followed.)
17061. 
17062. She approached him, saw his face, and something gave way within her.
17063. Her eyes grew dim. By the expression of her father's face, not sad, not
17064. crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging over
17065. her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst
17066. in life, one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and
17067. incomprehensible--the death of one she loved.
17068. 
17069. "Father! Andrew!"--said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such an
17070. indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father
17071. could not bear her look but turned away with a sob.
17072. 
17073. "Bad news! He's not among the prisoners nor among the killed! Kutuzov
17074. writes..." and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to drive the
17075. princess away by that scream... "Killed!"
17076. 
17077. The princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but on
17078. hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her
17079. beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy--a supreme joy apart from the
17080. joys and sorrows of this world--overflowed the great grief within her.
17081. She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and
17082. drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.
17083. 
17084. "Father," she said, "do not turn away from me, let us weep together."
17085. 
17086. "Scoundrels! Blackguards!" shrieked the old man, turning his face away
17087. from her. "Destroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go, go and
17088. tell Lise."
17089. 
17090. The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and
17091. wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took
17092. leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw him tender
17093. and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. "Did he believe?
17094. Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms
17095. of eternal peace and blessedness?" she thought.
17096. 
17097. "Father, tell me how it happened," she asked through her tears.
17098. 
17099. "Go! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and Russia's
17100. glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell Lise. I
17101. will follow."
17102. 
17103. When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat
17104. working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm
17105. peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see
17106. Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something
17107. joyful and mysterious taking place within her.
17108. 
17109. "Mary," she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back,
17110. "give me your hand." She took her sister-in-law's hand and held it below
17111. her waist.
17112. 
17113. Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained
17114. lifted in childlike happiness.
17115. 
17116. Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her
17117. sister-in-law's dress.
17118. 
17119. "There, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know, Mary,
17120. I am going to love him very much," said Lise, looking with bright and
17121. happy eyes at her sister-in-law.
17122. 
17123. Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.
17124. 
17125. "What is the matter, Mary?"
17126. 
17127. "Nothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew," she said, wiping away
17128. her tears on her sister-in-law's knee.
17129. 
17130. Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to
17131. prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as
17132. was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not
17133. understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as
17134. if in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was
17135. always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign
17136. expression and went out again without saying a word. She looked at
17137. Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of
17138. attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women,
17139. and suddenly began to cry.
17140. 
17141. "Has anything come from Andrew?" she asked.
17142. 
17143. "No, you know it's too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I
17144. feel afraid."
17145. 
17146. "So there's nothing?"
17147. 
17148. "Nothing," answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant eyes
17149. at her sister-in-law.
17150. 
17151. She had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the
17152. terrible news from her till after her confinement, which was expected
17153. within a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid
17154. their grief in their own way. The old prince would not cherish any hope:
17155. he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he
17156. sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a
17157. monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his
17158. memory, and he told everybody that his son had been killed. He tried not
17159. to change his former way of life, but his strength failed him. He walked
17160. less, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every day. Princess Mary
17161. hoped. She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news
17162. of his return.
17163. 
17164. 
17165. 
17166. 
17167. 
17168. CHAPTER VIII
17169. 
17170. 
17171. "Dearest," said the little princess after breakfast on the morning of
17172. the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit, but
17173. as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word, and even
17174. every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, so now
17175. the smile of the little princess--influenced by the general mood though
17176. without knowing its cause--was such as to remind one still more of the
17177. general sorrow.
17178. 
17179. "Dearest, I'm afraid this morning's fruschtique *--as Foka the cook
17180. calls it--has disagreed with me."
17181. 
17182. 
17183.     * Fruhstuck: breakfast.
17184. 
17185. 
17186. "What is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale. Oh, you
17187. are very pale!" said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft,
17188. ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law.
17189. 
17190. "Your excellency, should not Mary Bogdanovna be sent for?" said one
17191. of the maids who was present. (Mary Bogdanovna was a midwife from the
17192. neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.)
17193. 
17194. "Oh yes," assented Princess Mary, "perhaps that's it. I'll go. Courage,
17195. my angel." She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.
17196. 
17197. "Oh, no, no!" And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the
17198. little princess' face, an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain
17199. showed itself.
17200. 
17201. "No, it's only indigestion?... Say it's only indigestion, say so,
17202. Mary! Say..." And the little princess began to cry capriciously like
17203. a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some
17204. affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary Bogdanovna.
17205. 
17206. "Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!" she heard as she left the room.
17207. 
17208. The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump
17209. white hands with an air of calm importance.
17210. 
17211. "Mary Bogdanovna, I think it's beginning!" said Princess Mary looking at
17212. the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.
17213. 
17214. "Well, the Lord be thanked, Princess," said Mary Bogdanovna, not
17215. hastening her steps. "You young ladies should not know anything about
17216. it."
17217. 
17218. "But how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?" said the
17219. princess. (In accordance with Lise's and Prince Andrew's wishes they had
17220. sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any
17221. moment.)
17222. 
17223. "No matter, Princess, don't be alarmed," said Mary Bogdanovna. "We'll
17224. manage very well without a doctor."
17225. 
17226. Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy
17227. being carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the
17228. large leather sofa from Prince Andrew's study into the bedroom. On their
17229. faces was a quiet and solemn look.
17230. 
17231. Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the
17232. house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching
17233. what was going on in the passage. Some women passing with quiet steps in
17234. and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away. She did
17235. not venture to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sitting
17236. down in her easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before
17237. the icon stand. To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers
17238. did not calm her excitement. Suddenly her door opened softly and her old
17239. nurse, Praskovya Savishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the old
17240. prince had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl round
17241. her head.
17242. 
17243. "I've come to sit with you a bit, Masha," said the nurse, "and here
17244. I've brought the prince's wedding candles to light before his saint, my
17245. angel," she said with a sigh.
17246. 
17247. "Oh, nurse, I'm so glad!"
17248. 
17249. "God is merciful, birdie."
17250. 
17251. The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door
17252. with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began reading. Only
17253. when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another, the
17254. princess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging. Everyone in the
17255. house was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced
17256. as she sat in her room. But owing to the superstition that the fewer
17257. the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone
17258. tried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the
17259. ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the prince's
17260. household, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a
17261. consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished
17262. at that moment made itself felt.
17263. 
17264. There was no laughter in the maids' large hall. In the men servants'
17265. hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs'
17266. quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old
17267. prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent
17268. Tikhon to ask Mary Bogdanovna what news.--"Say only that 'the prince
17269. told me to ask,' and come and tell me her answer."
17270. 
17271. "Inform the prince that labor has begun," said Mary Bogdanovna, giving
17272. the messenger a significant look.
17273. 
17274. Tikhon went and told the prince.
17275. 
17276. "Very good!" said the prince closing the door behind him, and Tikhon did
17277. not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.
17278. 
17279. After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing
17280. the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed
17281. face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the
17282. shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he
17283. had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course.
17284. Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of
17285. heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased.
17286. No one slept.
17287. 
17288. It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its
17289. sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A relay
17290. of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from
17291. Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback with lanterns
17292. were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its
17293. hollows and snow-covered pools of water.
17294. 
17295. Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her
17296. luminous eyes fixed on her nurse's wrinkled face (every line of which
17297. she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the
17298. kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.
17299. 
17300. Nurse Savishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely
17301. hearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of
17302. times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary
17303. in Kishenev with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a
17304. midwife.
17305. 
17306. "God is merciful, doctors are never needed," she said.
17307. 
17308. Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the
17309. window, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the
17310. prince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks
17311. returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask
17312. curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft.
17313. Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the stocking she was
17314. knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open
17315. casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose
17316. locks of gray hair.
17317. 
17318. "Princess, my dear, there's someone driving up the avenue!" she said,
17319. holding the casement and not closing it. "With lanterns. Most likely the
17320. doctor."
17321. 
17322. "Oh, my God! thank God!" said Princess Mary. "I must go and meet him, he
17323. does not know Russian."
17324. 
17325. Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer.
17326. As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage
17327. with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On
17328. a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On
17329. the landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding
17330. another candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one
17331. could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that
17332. seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.
17333. 
17334. "Thank God!" said the voice. "And Father?"
17335. 
17336. "Gone to bed," replied the voice of Demyan the house steward, who was
17337. downstairs.
17338. 
17339. Then the voice said something more, Demyan replied, and the steps in the
17340. felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.
17341. 
17342. "It's Andrew!" thought Princess Mary. "No it can't be, that would be too
17343. extraordinary," and at the very moment she thought this, the face and
17344. figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered
17345. with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the
17346. candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and strangely
17347. softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up the stairs and
17348. embraced his sister.
17349. 
17350. "You did not get my letter?" he asked, and not waiting for a
17351. reply--which he would not have received, for the princess was unable to
17352. speak--he turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor
17353. who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post
17354. station), and again embraced his sister.
17355. 
17356. "What a strange fate, Masha darling!" And having taken off his cloak and
17357. felt boots, he went to the little princess' apartment.
17358. 
17359. 
17360. 
17361. 
17362. 
17363. CHAPTER IX
17364. 
17365. 
17366. The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her
17367. head (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair lay round
17368. her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its
17369. downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew entered
17370. and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying.
17371. Her glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested
17372. on him without changing their expression. "I love you all and have done
17373. no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!" her look seemed to
17374. say. She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance of his
17375. appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went round the sofa and kissed
17376. her forehead.
17377. 
17378. "My darling!" he said--a word he had never used to her before. "God is
17379. merciful...."
17380. 
17381. She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.
17382. 
17383. "I expected help from you and I get none, none from you either!" said
17384. her eyes. She was not surprised at his having come; she did not realize
17385. that he had come. His coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or
17386. with their relief. The pangs began again and Mary Bogdanovna advised
17387. Prince Andrew to leave the room.
17388. 
17389. The doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess Mary,
17390. again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk broke
17391. off at every moment. They waited and listened.
17392. 
17393. "Go, dear," said Princess Mary.
17394. 
17395. Prince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next
17396. to hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became
17397. confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with his hands
17398. and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless, animal moans came
17399. through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to the door, and tried to
17400. open it. Someone was holding it shut.
17401. 
17402. "You can't come in! You can't!" said a terrified voice from within.
17403. 
17404. He began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds
17405. went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriek--it could not be hers, she
17406. could not scream like that--came from the bedroom. Prince Andrew ran to
17407. the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.
17408. 
17409. "What have they taken a baby in there for?" thought Prince Andrew in the
17410. first second. "A baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or is
17411. the baby born?"
17412. 
17413. Then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail; tears
17414. choked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill be began to cry,
17415. sobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor with his shirt sleeves
17416. tucked up, without a coat, pale and with a trembling jaw, came out
17417. of the room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but the doctor gave him a
17418. bewildered look and passed by without a word. A woman rushed out and
17419. seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the threshold. He went into
17420. his wife's room. She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen
17421. her in five minutes before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of
17422. the cheeks, the same expression was on her charming childlike face with
17423. its upper lip covered with tiny black hair.
17424. 
17425. "I love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and what have you done
17426. to me?"--said her charming, pathetic, dead face.
17427. 
17428. In a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed
17429. in Mary Bogdanovna's trembling white hands.
17430. 
17431. 
17432. Two hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his father's
17433. room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to
17434. the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise
17435. round his son's neck, and without a word he began to sob like a child.
17436. 
17437. 
17438. Three days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went
17439. up the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the farewell kiss.
17440. And there in the coffin was the same face, though with closed eyes. "Ah,
17441. what have you done to me?" it still seemed to say, and Prince Andrew
17442. felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin
17443. he could neither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. The old man too
17444. came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one
17445. on the other on her breast, and to him, too, her face seemed to say:
17446. "Ah, what have you done to me, and why?" And at the sight the old man
17447. turned angrily away.
17448. 
17449. 
17450. Another five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas Andreevich
17451. was baptized. The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin,
17452. while the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy's little red and
17453. wrinkled soles and palms.
17454. 
17455. His grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid of dropping
17456. him, carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over
17457. to the godmother, Princess Mary. Prince Andrew sat in another room,
17458. faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font, and awaited
17459. the termination of the ceremony. He looked up joyfully at the baby when
17460. the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that
17461. the wax with the baby's hair had not sunk in the font but had floated.
17462. 
17463. 
17464. 
17465. 
17466. 
17467. CHAPTER X
17468. 
17469. 
17470. Rostov's share in Dolokhov's duel with Bezukhov was hushed up by the
17471. efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks
17472. as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of
17473. Moscow. As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the
17474. family, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties. Dolokhov
17475. recovered, and Rostov became very friendly with him during his
17476. convalescence. Dolokhov lay ill at his mother's who loved him
17477. passionately and tenderly, and old Mary Ivanovna, who had grown fond of
17478. Rostov for his friendship to her Fedya, often talked to him about her
17479. son.
17480. 
17481. "Yes, Count," she would say, "he is too noble and pure-souled for
17482. our present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like
17483. a reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it
17484. honorable, of Bezukhov? And Fedya, with his noble spirit, loved him and
17485. even now never says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg when
17486. they played some tricks on a policeman, didn't they do it together?
17487. And there! Bezukhov got off scotfree, while Fedya had to bear the whole
17488. burden on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go through! It's true he
17489. has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that? I think there
17490. were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as he. And
17491. now--this duel! Have these people no feeling, or honor? Knowing him to
17492. be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so straight! It's well
17493. God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who doesn't have intrigues
17494. nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see things he should have
17495. shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for months. And then to call him
17496. out, reckoning on Fedya not fighting because he owed him money! What
17497. baseness! What meanness! I know you understand Fedya, my dear count;
17498. that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few people do understand
17499. him. He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!"
17500. 
17501. Dolokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rostov in a way no
17502. one would have expected of him.
17503. 
17504. "I know people consider me a bad man!" he said. "Let them! I don't care
17505. a straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love, I love so that
17506. I would give my life for them, and the others I'd throttle if they
17507. stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother, and two or three
17508. friends--you among them--and as for the rest I only care about them
17509. in so far as they are harmful or useful. And most of them are harmful,
17510. especially the women. Yes, dear boy," he continued, "I have met loving,
17511. noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met any women--countesses
17512. or cooks--who were not venal. I have not yet met that divine purity and
17513. devotion I look for in women. If I found such a one I'd give my life for
17514. her! But those!..." and he made a gesture of contempt. "And believe me,
17515. if I still value my life it is only because I still hope to meet such
17516. a divine creature, who will regenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you
17517. don't understand it."
17518. 
17519. "Oh, yes, I quite understand," answered Rostov, who was under his new
17520. friend's influence.
17521. 
17522. In the autumn the Rostovs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter
17523. Denisov also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the
17524. winter of 1806, which Nicholas Rostov spent in Moscow, was one of the
17525. happiest, merriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas brought
17526. many young men to his parents' house. Vera was a handsome girl of
17527. twenty; Sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower;
17528. Natasha, half grown up and half child, was now childishly amusing, now
17529. girlishly enchanting.
17530. 
17531. At that time in the Rostovs' house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere
17532. characteristic of homes where there are very young and very
17533. charming girls. Every young man who came to the house--seeing those
17534. impressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own
17535. happiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful
17536. bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of
17537. young girls ready for anything and full of hope--experienced the
17538. same feeling; sharing with the young folk of the Rostovs' household a
17539. readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.
17540. 
17541. Among the young men introduced by Rostov one of the first was Dolokhov,
17542. whom everyone in the house liked except Natasha. She almost quarreled
17543. with her brother about him. She insisted that he was a bad man, and
17544. that in the duel with Bezukhov, Pierre was right and Dolokhov wrong, and
17545. further that he was disagreeable and unnatural.
17546. 
17547. "There's nothing for me to understand," she cried out with resolute
17548. self-will, "he is wicked and heartless. There now, I like your Denisov
17549. though he is a rake and all that, still I like him; so you see I do
17550. understand. I don't know how to put it... with this one everything is
17551. calculated, and I don't like that. But Denisov..."
17552. 
17553. "Oh, Denisov is quite different," replied Nicholas, implying that even
17554. Denisov was nothing compared to Dolokhov--"you must understand what a
17555. soul there is in Dolokhov, you should see him with his mother. What a
17556. heart!"
17557. 
17558. "Well, I don't know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And do
17559. you know he has fallen in love with Sonya?"
17560. 
17561. "What nonsense..."
17562. 
17563. "I'm certain of it; you'll see."
17564. 
17565. Natasha's prediction proved true. Dolokhov, who did not usually care
17566. for the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the
17567. question for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon
17568. settled. He came because of Sonya. And Sonya, though she would never
17569. have dared to say so, knew it and blushed scarlet every time Dolokhov
17570. appeared.
17571. 
17572. Dolokhov often dined at the Rostovs', never missed a performance at
17573. which they were present, and went to Iogel's balls for young people
17574. which the Rostovs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to Sonya
17575. and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
17576. glances without coloring, but even the old countess and Natasha blushed
17577. when they saw his looks.
17578. 
17579. It was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible
17580. influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.
17581. 
17582. Rostov noticed something new in Dolokhov's relations with Sonya, but
17583. he did not explain to himself what these new relations were. "They're
17584. always in love with someone," he thought of Sonya and Natasha. But he
17585. was not as much at ease with Sonya and Dolokhov as before and was less
17586. frequently at home.
17587. 
17588. In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with
17589. Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. Orders were
17590. given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the regular army,
17591. and besides this, nine men in every thousand for the militia. Everywhere
17592. Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war
17593. was talked of. For the Rostov family the whole interest of these
17594. preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of
17595. remaining in Moscow, and only awaited the termination of Denisov's
17596. furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment. His
17597. approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself, but rather
17598. gave zest to his pleasures. He spent the greater part of his time away
17599. from home, at dinners, parties, and balls.
17600. 
17601. 
17602. 
17603. 
17604. 
17605. CHAPTER XI
17606. 
17607. 
17608. On the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home, a thing he had
17609. rarely done of late. It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and Denisov
17610. were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany. About twenty people
17611. were present, including Dolokhov and Denisov.
17612. 
17613. Never had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous
17614. atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rostovs' house as at this
17615. holiday time. "Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That
17616. is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing
17617. we are interested in here," said the spirit of the place.
17618. 
17619. Nicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without
17620. visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited,
17621. returned home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and
17622. felt the tension of the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a
17623. curious embarrassment among some of those present. Sonya, Dolokhov,
17624. and the old countess were especially disturbed, and to a lesser degree
17625. Natasha. Nicholas understood that something must have happened between
17626. Sonya and Dolokhov before dinner, and with the kindly sensitiveness
17627. natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner. On
17628. that same evening there was to be one of the balls that Iogel (the
17629. dancing master) gave for his pupils during the holidays.
17630. 
17631. "Nicholas, will you come to Iogel's? Please do!" said Natasha. "He asked
17632. you, and Vasili Dmitrich * is also going."
17633. 
17634. 
17635.     * Denisov.
17636. 
17637. 
17638. "Where would I not go at the countess' command!" said Denisov, who at
17639. the Rostovs' had jocularly assumed the role of Natasha's knight. "I'm
17640. even weady to dance the pas de chale."
17641. 
17642. "If I have time," answered Nicholas. "But I promised the Arkharovs; they
17643. have a party."
17644. 
17645. "And you?" he asked Dolokhov, but as soon as he had asked the question
17646. he noticed that it should not have been put.
17647. 
17648. "Perhaps," coldly and angrily replied Dolokhov, glancing at Sonya, and,
17649. scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre at
17650. the Club dinner.
17651. 
17652. "There is something up," thought Nicholas, and he was further confirmed
17653. in this conclusion by the fact that Dolokhov left immediately after
17654. dinner. He called Natasha and asked her what was the matter.
17655. 
17656. "And I was looking for you," said Natasha running out to him. "I told
17657. you, but you would not believe it," she said triumphantly. "He has
17658. proposed to Sonya!"
17659. 
17660. Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sonya of late, something
17661. seemed to give way within him at this news. Dolokhov was a suitable and
17662. in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From
17663. the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the
17664. question for her to refuse him. And therefore Nicholas' first feeling
17665. on hearing the news was one of anger with Sonya.... He tried to say,
17666. "That's capital; of course she'll forget her childish promises and
17667. accept the offer," but before he had time to say it Natasha began again.
17668. 
17669. "And fancy! she refused him quite definitely!" adding, after a pause,
17670. "she told him she loved another."
17671. 
17672. "Yes, my Sonya could not have done otherwise!" thought Nicholas.
17673. 
17674. "Much as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she won't change
17675. once she has said..."
17676. 
17677. "And Mamma pressed her!" said Nicholas reproachfully.
17678. 
17679. "Yes," said Natasha. "Do you know, Nicholas--don't be angry--but I know
17680. you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but I know for certain
17681. that you won't marry her."
17682. 
17683. "Now you don't know that at all!" said Nicholas. "But I must talk to
17684. her. What a darling Sonya is!" he added with a smile.
17685. 
17686. "Ah, she is indeed a darling! I'll send her to you."
17687. 
17688. And Natasha kissed her brother and ran away.
17689. 
17690. A minute later Sonya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared look.
17691. Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the first time
17692. since his return that they had talked alone and about their love.
17693. 
17694. "Sophie," he began, timidly at first and then more and more boldly,
17695. "if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous
17696. match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend..."
17697. 
17698. Sonya interrupted him.
17699. 
17700. "I have already refused," she said hurriedly.
17701. 
17702. "If you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I..."
17703. 
17704. Sonya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frightened look.
17705. 
17706. "Nicholas, don't tell me that!" she said.
17707. 
17708. "No, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to say
17709. it. If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth. I
17710. love you, and I think I love you more than anyone else...."
17711. 
17712. "That is enough for me," said Sonya, blushing.
17713. 
17714. "No, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in
17715. love again, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship,
17716. confidence, and love as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does
17717. not wish it. In a word, I make no promise. And I beg you to consider
17718. Dolokhov's offer," he said, articulating his friend's name with
17719. difficulty.
17720. 
17721. "Don't say that to me! I want nothing. I love you as a brother and
17722. always shall, and I want nothing more."
17723. 
17724. "You are an angel: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of misleading
17725. you."
17726. 
17727. And Nicholas again kissed her hand.
17728. 
17729. 
17730. 
17731. 
17732. 
17733. CHAPTER XII
17734. 
17735. 
17736. Iogel's were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So said the mothers as
17737. they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps, and
17738. so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they were
17739. ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and women who came to
17740. these balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyable.
17741. That year two marriages had come of these balls. The two pretty young
17742. Princesses Gorchakov met suitors there and were married and so further
17743. increased the fame of these dances. What distinguished them from others
17744. was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the good-natured
17745. Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of
17746. his art, as he collected the tickets from all his visitors. There was
17747. the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves
17748. as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for
17749. the first time. With scarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed to
17750. be, pretty--so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes.
17751. Sometimes the best of the pupils, of whom Natasha, who was exceptionally
17752. graceful, was first, even danced the pas de chale, but at this last ball
17753. only the ecossaise, the anglaise, and the mazurka, which was just coming
17754. into fashion, were danced. Iogel had taken a ballroom in Bezukhov's
17755. house, and the ball, as everyone said, was a great success. There were
17756. many pretty girls and the Rostov girls were among the prettiest. They
17757. were both particularly happy and gay. That evening, proud of Dolokhov's
17758. proposal, her refusal, and her explanation with Nicholas, Sonya twirled
17759. about before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair
17760. plaited, and she was transparently radiant with impulsive joy.
17761. 
17762. Natasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
17763. ball was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with pink
17764. ribbons.
17765. 
17766. Natasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She
17767. was not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever
17768. person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.
17769. 
17770. "Oh, how delightful it is!" she kept saying, running up to Sonya.
17771. 
17772. Nicholas and Denisov were walking up and down, looking with kindly
17773. patronage at the dancers.
17774. 
17775. "How sweet she is--she will be a weal beauty!" said Denisov.
17776. 
17777. "Who?"
17778. 
17779. "Countess Natasha," answered Denisov.
17780. 
17781. "And how she dances! What gwace!" he said again after a pause.
17782. 
17783. "Who are you talking about?"
17784. 
17785. "About your sister," ejaculated Denisov testily.
17786. 
17787. Rostov smiled.
17788. 
17789. "My dear count, you were one of my best pupils--you must dance," said
17790. little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. "Look how many charming young
17791. ladies-" He turned with the same request to Denisov who was also a
17792. former pupil of his.
17793. 
17794. "No, my dear fellow, I'll be a wallflower," said Denisov. "Don't you
17795. wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?"
17796. 
17797. "Oh no!" said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. "You were only
17798. inattentive, but you had talent--oh yes, you had talent!"
17799. 
17800.  The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not
17801. refuse Iogel and asked Sonya to dance. Denisov sat down by the old
17802. ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told
17803. them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young
17804. people dancing, Iogel with Natasha, his pride and his best pupil, were
17805. the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little feet
17806. in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with Natasha, who, though
17807. shy, went on carefully executing her steps. Denisov did not take
17808. his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly
17809. indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not
17810. because he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rostov
17811. who was passing:
17812. 
17813. "This is not at all the thing," he said. "What sort of Polish mazuwka is
17814. this? But she does dance splendidly."
17815. 
17816. Knowing that Denisov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly
17817. way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to Natasha:
17818. 
17819. "Go and choose Denisov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!" he said.
17820. 
17821. When it came to Natasha's turn to choose a partner, she rose and,
17822. tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran
17823. timidly to the corner where Denisov sat. She saw that everybody was
17824. looking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that Denisov was refusing
17825. though he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.
17826. 
17827. "Please, Vasili Dmitrich," Natasha was saying, "do come!"
17828. 
17829. "Oh no, let me off, Countess," Denisov replied.
17830. 
17831. "Now then, Vaska," said Nicholas.
17832. 
17833. "They coax me as if I were Vaska the cat!" said Denisov jokingly.
17834. 
17835. "I'll sing for you a whole evening," said Natasha.
17836. 
17837. "Oh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!" said Denisov, and he
17838. unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his
17839. partner's hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot,
17840. waiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was
17841. Denisov's short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he
17842. felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways at
17843. his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with one
17844. foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room taking
17845. his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across the
17846. room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them,
17847. when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs, he stopped
17848. short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot clanking his
17849. spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel against his
17850. right, flew round again in a circle. Natasha guessed what he meant to
17851. do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how.
17852. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left, now with his
17853. right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him, and again
17854. jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would
17855. rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath, and then
17856. he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps. When at
17857. last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair, he drew
17858. up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Natasha did not even make
17859. him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement, smiling as if she
17860. did not recognize him.
17861. 
17862. "What does this mean?" she brought out.
17863. 
17864. Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone
17865. was delighted with Denisov's skill, he was asked again and again as a
17866. partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the
17867. good old days. Denisov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself
17868. with his handkerchief, sat down by Natasha and did not leave her for the
17869. rest of the evening.
17870. 
17871. 
17872. 
17873. 
17874. 
17875. CHAPTER XIII
17876. 
17877. 
17878. For two days after that Rostov did not see Dolokhov at his own or at
17879. Dolokhov's home: on the third day he received a note from him:
17880. 
17881. 
17882. As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know
17883. of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper
17884. tonight to my friends--come to the English Hotel.
17885. 
17886. 
17887. About ten o'clock Rostov went to the English Hotel straight from the
17888. theater, where he had been with his family and Denisov. He was at once
17889. shown to the best room, which Dolokhov had taken for that evening. Some
17890. twenty men were gathered round a table at which Dolokhov sat between
17891. two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he was
17892. keeping the bank. Rostov had not seen him since his proposal and Sonya's
17893. refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet.
17894. 
17895. Dolokhov's clear, cold glance met Rostov as soon as he entered the door,
17896. as though he had long expected him.
17897. 
17898. "It's a long time since we met," he said. "Thanks for coming. I'll just
17899. finish dealing, and then Ilyushka will come with his chorus."
17900. 
17901. "I called once or twice at your house," said Rostov, reddening.
17902. 
17903. Dolokhov made no reply.
17904. 
17905. "You may punt," he said.
17906. 
17907. Rostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had
17908. with Dolokhov. "None but fools trust to luck in play," Dolokhov had then
17909. said.
17910. 
17911. "Or are you afraid to play with me?" Dolokhov now asked as if guessing
17912. Rostov's thought.
17913. 
17914. Beneath his smile Rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the Club
17915. dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he had felt
17916. a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually cruel, action.
17917. 
17918. Rostov felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke
17919. with which to reply to Dolokhov's words. But before he had thought
17920. of anything, Dolokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and
17921. deliberately so that everyone could hear:
17922. 
17923. "Do you remember we had a talk about cards... 'He's a fool who trusts to
17924. luck, one should make certain,' and I want to try."
17925. 
17926. "To try his luck or the certainty?" Rostov asked himself.
17927. 
17928. "Well, you'd better not play," Dolokhov added, and springing a new pack
17929. of cards said: "Bank, gentlemen!"
17930. 
17931. Moving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rostov sat down by his
17932. side and at first did not play. Dolokhov kept glancing at him.
17933. 
17934. "Why don't you play?" he asked.
17935. 
17936. And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a
17937. card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.
17938. 
17939. "I have no money with me," he said.
17940. 
17941. "I'll trust you."
17942. 
17943. Rostov staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and again
17944. lost. Dolokhov "killed," that is, beat, ten cards of Rostov's running.
17945. 
17946. "Gentlemen," said Dolokhov after he had dealt for some time. "Please
17947. place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning."
17948. 
17949. One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.
17950. 
17951. "Yes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I
17952. ask you to put the money on your cards," replied Dolokhov. "Don't stint
17953. yourself, we'll settle afterwards," he added, turning to Rostov.
17954. 
17955. The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.
17956. 
17957. All Rostov's cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored
17958. up against him. He wrote "800 rubles" on a card, but while the waiter
17959. filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake
17960. of twenty rubles.
17961. 
17962. "Leave it," said Dolokhov, though he did not seem to be even looking at
17963. Rostov, "you'll win it back all the sooner. I lose to the others but win
17964. from you. Or are you afraid of me?" he asked again.
17965. 
17966. Rostov submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven
17967. of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He
17968. well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts,
17969. on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written "800 rubles" in clear
17970. upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed
17971. him, smiled at Dolokhov's words, and with a sinking heart, waiting for
17972. a seven to turn up, gazed at Dolokhov's hands which held the pack. Much
17973. depended on Rostov's winning or losing on that seven of hearts. On the
17974. previous Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles,
17975. and though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told
17976. Nicholas that this was all he could let him have till May, and asked him
17977. to be more economical this time. Nicholas had replied that it would be
17978. more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take
17979. anything more till the spring. Now only twelve hundred rubles was left
17980. of that money, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the
17981. loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his
17982. word. With a sinking heart he watched Dolokhov's hands and thought,
17983. "Now then, make haste and let me have this card and I'll take my cap
17984. and drive home to supper with Denisov, Natasha, and Sonya, and will
17985. certainly never touch a card again." At that moment his home life,
17986. jokes with Petya, talks with Sonya, duets with Natasha, piquet with his
17987. father, and even his comfortable bed in the house on the Povarskaya rose
17988. before him with such vividness, clearness, and charm that it seemed as
17989. if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not
17990. conceive that a stupid chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right
17991. rather than to the left, might deprive him of all this happiness, newly
17992. appreciated and newly illumined, and plunge him into the depths of
17993. unknown and undefined misery. That could not be, yet he awaited with
17994. a sinking heart the movement of Dolokhov's hands. Those broad, reddish
17995. hands, with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid down
17996. the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.
17997. 
17998. "So you are not afraid to play with me?" repeated Dolokhov, and as if
17999. about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his
18000. chair, and began deliberately with a smile:
18001. 
18002. "Yes, gentlemen, I've been told there's a rumor going about Moscow that
18003. I'm a sharper, so I advise you to be careful."
18004. 
18005. "Come now, deal!" exclaimed Rostov.
18006. 
18007. "Oh, those Moscow gossips!" said Dolokhov, and he took up the cards with
18008. a smile.
18009. 
18010. "Aah!" Rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The seven
18011. he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had lost
18012. more than he could pay.
18013. 
18014. "Still, don't ruin yourself!" said Dolokhov with a side glance at Rostov
18015. as he continued to deal.
18016. 
18017. 
18018. 
18019. 
18020. 
18021. CHAPTER XIV
18022. 
18023. 
18024. An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested
18025. in their own play.
18026. 
18027. The whole interest was concentrated on Rostov. Instead of sixteen
18028. hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him,
18029. which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely
18030. supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already
18031. exceeded twenty thousand rubles. Dolokhov was no longer listening to
18032. stories or telling them, but followed every movement of Rostov's hands
18033. and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him. He had decided
18034. to play until that score reached forty-three thousand. He had fixed on
18035. that number because forty-three was the sum of his and Sonya's joint
18036. ages. Rostov, leaning his head on both hands, sat at the table which
18037. was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wine, and littered
18038. with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him: that those
18039. broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt
18040. sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, held him in their power.
18041. 
18042. "Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back's
18043. impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double
18044. or quits... it can't be!... And why is he doing this to me?" Rostov
18045. pondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but Dolokhov refused to
18046. accept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at
18047. one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge
18048. over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand
18049. from the crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the
18050. cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the
18051. total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other
18052. players, or peered at the now cold face of Dolokhov and tried to read
18053. what was passing in his mind.
18054. 
18055. "He knows of course what this loss means to me. He can't want my ruin.
18056. Wasn't he my friend? Wasn't I fond of him? But it's not his fault.
18057. What's he to do if he has such luck?... And it's not my fault either,"
18058. he thought to himself, "I have done nothing wrong. Have I killed anyone,
18059. or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible misfortune?
18060. And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to this table with
18061. the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma's
18062. name day and then going home. I was so happy, so free, so lighthearted!
18063. And I did not realize how happy I was! When did that end and when did
18064. this new, terrible state of things begin? What marked the change? I sat
18065. all the time in this same place at this table, chose and placed cards,
18066. and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the same way. When did it
18067. happen and what has happened? I am well and strong and still the same
18068. and in the same place. No, it can't be! Surely it will all end in
18069. nothing!"
18070. 
18071. He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot.
18072. His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless
18073. efforts to seem calm.
18074. 
18075. The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand.
18076. Rostov had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he meant
18077. to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when Dolokhov,
18078. slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began rapidly adding
18079. up the total of Rostov's debt, breaking the chalk as he marked the
18080. figures in his clear, bold hand.
18081. 
18082. "Supper, it's time for supper! And here are the gypsies!"
18083. 
18084. Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside
18085. and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood that it
18086. was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:
18087. 
18088. "Well, won't you go on? I had a splendid card all ready," as if it were
18089. the fun of the game which interested him most.
18090. 
18091. "It's all up! I'm lost!" thought he. "Now a bullet through my
18092. brain--that's all that's left me!" And at the same time he said in a
18093. cheerful voice:
18094. 
18095. "Come now, just this one more little card!"
18096. 
18097. "All right!" said Dolokhov, having finished the addition. "All right!
18098. Twenty-one rubles," he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one by which
18099. the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up
18100. a pack he prepared to deal. Rostov submissively unbent the corner of his
18101. card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended, carefully wrote
18102. twenty-one.
18103. 
18104. "It's all the same to me," he said. "I only want to see whether you will
18105. let me win this ten, or beat it."
18106. 
18107. Dolokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rostov detested at that moment
18108. those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists, which
18109. held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.
18110. 
18111. "You owe forty-three thousand, Count," said Dolokhov, and stretching
18112. himself he rose from the table. "One does get tired sitting so long," he
18113. added.
18114. 
18115. "Yes, I'm tired too," said Rostov.
18116. 
18117. Dolokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to
18118. jest.
18119. 
18120. "When am I to receive the money, Count?"
18121. 
18122. Rostov, flushing, drew Dolokhov into the next room.
18123. 
18124. "I cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?" he said.
18125. 
18126. "I say, Rostov," said Dolokhov clearly, smiling and looking Nicholas
18127. straight in the eyes, "you know the saying, 'Lucky in love, unlucky at
18128. cards.' Your cousin is in love with you, I know."
18129. 
18130. "Oh, it's terrible to feel oneself so in this man's power," thought
18131. Rostov. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother
18132. by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to escape
18133. it all, and felt that Dolokhov knew that he could save him from all this
18134. shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a
18135. mouse.
18136. 
18137. "Your cousin..." Dolokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted him.
18138. 
18139. "My cousin has nothing to do with this and it's not necessary to mention
18140. her!" he exclaimed fiercely.
18141. 
18142. "Then when am I to have it?"
18143. 
18144. "Tomorrow," replied Rostov and left the room.
18145. 
18146. 
18147. 
18148. 
18149. 
18150. CHAPTER XV
18151. 
18152. 
18153. To say "tomorrow" and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult, but to
18154. go home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and father, confess
18155. and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor, was
18156. terrible.
18157. 
18158. At home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after returning
18159. from the theater, had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord.
18160. As soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere
18161. of love which pervaded the Rostov household that winter and, now after
18162. Dolokhov's proposal and Iogel's ball, seemed to have grown thicker
18163. round Sonya and Natasha as the air does before a thunderstorm. Sonya and
18164. Natasha, in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater, looking
18165. pretty and conscious of it, were standing by the clavichord, happy and
18166. smiling. Vera was playing chess with Shinshin in the drawing room. The
18167. old countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son, sat playing
18168. patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house. Denisov,
18169. with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord striking
18170. chords with his short fingers, his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling
18171. as he sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some verses called
18172. "Enchantress," which he had composed, and to which he was trying to fit
18173. music:
18174. 
18175.    Enchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre
18176.    What magic power is this recalls me still?
18177.    What spark has set my inmost soul on fire,
18178.    What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?
18179. 
18180. He was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling
18181. black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy Natasha.
18182. 
18183. "Splendid! Excellent!" exclaimed Natasha. "Another verse," she said,
18184. without noticing Nicholas.
18185. 
18186. "Everything's still the same with them," thought Nicholas, glancing into
18187. the drawing room, where he saw Vera and his mother with the old lady.
18188. 
18189. "Ah, and here's Nicholas!" cried Natasha, running up to him.
18190. 
18191. "Is Papa at home?" he asked.
18192. 
18193. "I am so glad you've come!" said Natasha, without answering him. "We are
18194. enjoying ourselves! Vasili Dmitrich is staying a day longer for my sake!
18195. Did you know?"
18196. 
18197. "No, Papa is not back yet," said Sonya.
18198. 
18199. "Nicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!" called the old countess from
18200. the drawing room.
18201. 
18202. Nicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently at her
18203. table began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the dancing
18204. room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade
18205. Natasha to sing.
18206. 
18207. "All wight! All wight!" shouted Denisov. "It's no good making excuses
18208. now! It's your turn to sing the ba'cawolla--I entweat you!"
18209. 
18210. The countess glanced at her silent son.
18211. 
18212. "What is the matter?" she asked.
18213. 
18214. "Oh, nothing," said he, as if weary of being continually asked the same
18215. question. "Will Papa be back soon?"
18216. 
18217. "I expect so."
18218. 
18219. "Everything's the same with them. They know nothing about it! Where am I
18220. to go?" thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing room where the
18221. clavichord stood.
18222. 
18223. Sonya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to Denisov's
18224. favorite barcarolle. Natasha was preparing to sing. Denisov was looking
18225. at her with enraptured eyes.
18226. 
18227. Nicholas began pacing up and down the room.
18228. 
18229. "Why do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? There's nothing to
18230. be happy about!" thought he.
18231. 
18232. Sonya struck the first chord of the prelude.
18233. 
18234. "My God, I'm a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my brain is
18235. the only thing left me--not singing!" his thoughts ran on. "Go away? But
18236. where to? It's one--let them sing!"
18237. 
18238. He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Denisov and the girls
18239. and avoiding their eyes.
18240. 
18241. "Nikolenka, what is the matter?" Sonya's eyes fixed on him seemed to
18242. ask. She noticed at once that something had happened to him.
18243. 
18244. Nicholas turned away from her. Natasha too, with her quick instinct, had
18245. instantly noticed her brother's condition. But, though she noticed it,
18246. she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from sorrow,
18247. sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself as
18248. young people often do. "No, I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by
18249. sympathy with anyone's sorrow," she felt, and she said to herself: "No,
18250. I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as I am."
18251. 
18252. "Now, Sonya!" she said, going to the very middle of the room, where she
18253. considered the resonance was best.
18254. 
18255. Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet
18256. dancers do, Natasha, rising energetically from her heels to her toes,
18257. stepped to the middle of the room and stood still.
18258. 
18259. "Yes, that's me!" she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with which
18260. Denisov followed her.
18261. 
18262. "And what is she so pleased about?" thought Nicholas, looking at his
18263. sister. "Why isn't she dull and ashamed?"
18264. 
18265. Natasha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose,
18266. her eyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her
18267. surroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may
18268. produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which
18269. leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill
18270. you and make you weep.
18271. 
18272. Natasha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously,
18273. mainly because Denisov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang
18274. as a child, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish,
18275. painstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing
18276. well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: "It is not trained,
18277. but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained." Only they generally
18278. said this some time after she had finished singing. While that untrained
18279. voice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was
18280. sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in
18281. it and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a virginal
18282. freshness, an unconsciousness of her own powers, and an as yet untrained
18283. velvety softness, which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that
18284. it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling
18285. it.
18286. 
18287. "What is this?" thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely opened
18288. eyes. "What has happened to her? How she is singing today!" And suddenly
18289. the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note, the
18290. next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into three beats:
18291. "Oh mio crudele affetto."... One, two, three... one, two, three...
18292. One... "Oh mio crudele affetto."... One, two, three... One. "Oh, this
18293. senseless life of ours!" thought Nicholas. "All this misery, and money,
18294. and Dolokhov, and anger, and honor--it's all nonsense... but this is
18295. real.... Now then, Natasha, now then, dearest! Now then, darling! How
18296. will she take that si? She's taken it! Thank God!" And without noticing
18297. that he was singing, to strengthen the si he sung a second, a third
18298. below the high note. "Ah, God! How fine! Did I really take it? How
18299. fortunate!" he thought.
18300. 
18301. Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was finest
18302. in Rostov's soul! And this something was apart from everything else
18303. in the world and above everything in the world. "What were losses, and
18304. Dolokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob
18305. and yet be happy..."
18306. 
18307. 
18308. 
18309. 
18310. 
18311. CHAPTER XVI
18312. 
18313. 
18314. It was long since Rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as he did
18315. that day. But no sooner had Natasha finished her barcarolle than
18316. reality again presented itself. He got up without saying a word and went
18317. downstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old count
18318. came in from his Club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing him
18319. drive up, went to meet him.
18320. 
18321. "Well--had a good time?" said the old count, smiling gaily and proudly
18322. at his son.
18323. 
18324. Nicholas tried to say "Yes," but could not: and he nearly burst into
18325. sobs. The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son's
18326. condition.
18327. 
18328. "Ah, it can't be avoided!" thought Nicholas, for the first and last
18329. time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel ashamed
18330. of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him have the
18331. carriage to drive to town:
18332. 
18333. "Papa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting. I
18334. need some money."
18335. 
18336. "Dear me!" said his father, who was in a specially good humor. "I told
18337. you it would not be enough. How much?"
18338. 
18339. "Very much," said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless smile,
18340. for which he was long unable to forgive himself, "I have lost a little,
18341. I mean a good deal, a great deal--forty three thousand."
18342. 
18343. "What! To whom?... Nonsense!" cried the count, suddenly reddening with
18344. an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.
18345. 
18346. "I promised to pay tomorrow," said Nicholas.
18347. 
18348. "Well!..." said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking
18349. helplessly on the sofa.
18350. 
18351. "It can't be helped It happens to everyone!" said the son, with a
18352. bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a
18353. worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He
18354. longed to kiss his father's hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but
18355. said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to everyone!
18356. 
18357. The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son's words and began
18358. bustlingly searching for something.
18359. 
18360. "Yes, yes," he muttered, "it will be difficult, I fear, difficult to
18361. raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?"
18362. 
18363. And with a furtive glance at his son's face, the count went out of the
18364. room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all
18365. expected this.
18366. 
18367. "Papa! Pa-pa!" he called after him, sobbing, "forgive me!" And seizing
18368. his father's hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears.
18369. 
18370. While father and son were having their explanation, the mother and
18371. daughter were having one not less important. Natasha came running to her
18372. mother, quite excited.
18373. 
18374. "Mamma!... Mamma!... He has made me..."
18375. 
18376. "Made what?"
18377. 
18378. "Made, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!" she exclaimed.
18379. 
18380. The countess did not believe her ears. Denisov had proposed. To whom? To
18381. this chit of a girl, Natasha, who not so long ago was playing with dolls
18382. and who was still having lessons.
18383. 
18384. "Don't, Natasha! What nonsense!" she said, hoping it was a joke.
18385. 
18386. "Nonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact," said Natasha indignantly.
18387. "I come to ask you what to do, and you call it 'nonsense!'"
18388. 
18389. The countess shrugged her shoulders.
18390. 
18391. "If it is true that Monsieur Denisov has made you a proposal, tell him
18392. he is a fool, that's all!"
18393. 
18394. "No, he's not a fool!" replied Natasha indignantly and seriously.
18395. 
18396. "Well then, what do you want? You're all in love nowadays. Well, if you
18397. are in love, marry him!" said the countess, with a laugh of annoyance.
18398. "Good luck to you!"
18399. 
18400. "No, Mamma, I'm not in love with him, I suppose I'm not in love with
18401. him."
18402. 
18403. "Well then, tell him so."
18404. 
18405. "Mamma, are you cross? Don't be cross, dear! Is it my fault?"
18406. 
18407. "No, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?" said
18408. the countess smiling.
18409. 
18410. "No, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. It's all very well
18411. for you," said Natasha, with a responsive smile. "You should have
18412. seen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came out
18413. accidently."
18414. 
18415. "Well, all the same, you must refuse him."
18416. 
18417. "No, I mustn't. I am so sorry for him! He's so nice."
18418. 
18419. "Well then, accept his offer. It's high time for you to be married,"
18420. answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.
18421. 
18422. "No, Mamma, but I'm so sorry for him. I don't know how I'm to say it."
18423. 
18424. "And there's nothing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself," said
18425. the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this little
18426. Natasha as grown up.
18427. 
18428. "No, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and you'll listen at
18429. the door," and Natasha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall,
18430. where Denisov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his
18431. face in his hands.
18432. 
18433. He jumped up at the sound of her light step.
18434. 
18435. "Nataly," he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, "decide my fate.
18436. It is in your hands."
18437. 
18438. "Vasili Dmitrich, I'm so sorry for you!... No, but you are so nice...
18439. but it won't do...not that... but as a friend, I shall always love you."
18440. 
18441. Denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not
18442. understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they
18443. heard the quick rustle of the countess' dress. She came up to them.
18444. 
18445. "Vasili Dmitrich, I thank you for the honor," she said, with an
18446. embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Denisov--"but my daughter
18447. is so young, and I thought that, as my son's friend, you would have
18448. addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would not have obliged
18449. me to give this refusal."
18450. 
18451. "Countess..." said Denisov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face. He
18452. tried to say more, but faltered.
18453. 
18454. Natasha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She began to
18455. sob aloud.
18456. 
18457. "Countess, I have done w'ong," Denisov went on in an unsteady voice,
18458. "but believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family that I
18459. would give my life twice over..." He looked at the countess, and seeing
18460. her severe face said: "Well, good-by, Countess," and kissing her
18461. hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without looking at
18462. Natasha.
18463. 
18464. 
18465. Next day Rostov saw Denisov off. He did not wish to stay another day in
18466. Moscow. All Denisov's Moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment
18467. at the gypsies', with the result that he had no recollection of how he
18468. was put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey.
18469. 
18470. After Denisov's departure, Rostov spent another fortnight in Moscow,
18471. without going out of the house, waiting for the money his father could
18472. not at once raise, and he spent most of his time in the girls' room.
18473. 
18474. Sonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was as if she
18475. wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her
18476. love him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of
18477. her.
18478. 
18479. He filled the girls' albums with verses and music, and having at last
18480. sent Dolokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and received his
18481. receipt, he left at the end of November, without taking leave of any of
18482. his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland.

18494. CHAPTER I
18495. 
18496. 
18497. After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the
18498. Torzhok post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster
18499. would not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing,
18500. he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big
18501. feet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.
18502. 
18503. "Will you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and
18504. tea?" asked his valet.
18505. 
18506. Pierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had
18507. begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same
18508. question--one so important that he took no notice of what went on around
18509. him. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to Petersburg
18510. earlier or later, or whether he secured accommodation at this station,
18511. but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of
18512. indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for the rest
18513. of his life.
18514. 
18515. The postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling Torzhok
18516. embroidery came into the room offering their services. Without changing
18517. his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable
18518. to understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without
18519. having solved the problems that so absorbed him. He had been engrossed
18520. by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from Sokolniki after
18521. the duel and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless night. But now,
18522. in the solitude of the journey, they seized him with special force. No
18523. matter what he thought about, he always returned to these same questions
18524. which he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself. It was
18525. as if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together were
18526. stripped, so that the screw could not get in or out, but went on turning
18527. uselessly in the same place.
18528. 
18529. The postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to
18530. wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency
18531. have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted
18532. to get more money from the traveler.
18533. 
18534. "Is this good or bad?" Pierre asked himself. "It is good for me, bad
18535. for another traveler, and for himself it's unavoidable, because he needs
18536. money for food; the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing
18537. for letting a private traveler have the courier horses. But the officer
18538. thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible. And I,"
18539. continued Pierre, "shot Dolokhov because I considered myself injured,
18540. and Louis XVI was executed because they considered him a criminal, and
18541. a year later they executed those who executed him--also for some reason.
18542. What is bad? What is good? What should one love and what hate? What does
18543. one live for? And what am I? What is life, and what is death? What power
18544. governs all?"
18545. 
18546. There was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that not
18547. a logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer was: "You'll
18548. die and all will end. You'll die and know all, or cease asking." But
18549. dying was also dreadful.
18550. 
18551. The Torzhok peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering her
18552. wares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. "I have hundreds of
18553. rubles I don't know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered
18554. cloak looking timidly at me," he thought. "And what does she want the
18555. money for? As if that money could add a hair's breadth to happiness or
18556. peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me less a prey
18557. to evil and death?--death which ends all and must come today or
18558. tomorrow--at any rate, in an instant as compared with eternity." And
18559. again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread, and again it turned
18560. uselessly in the same place.
18561. 
18562. His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by
18563. Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
18564. struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. "And why did she resist her
18565. seducer when she loved him?" he thought. "God could not have put into
18566. her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife--as she once
18567. was--did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been found
18568. out, nothing discovered," Pierre again said to himself. "All we can know
18569. is that we know nothing. And that's the height of human wisdom."
18570. 
18571. Everything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and
18572. repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre
18573. found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.
18574. 
18575. "I make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this
18576. gentleman," said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another
18577. traveler, also detained for lack of horses.
18578. 
18579. The newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old
18580. man, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite
18581. grayish color.
18582. 
18583. Pierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that
18584. had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who,
18585. with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the
18586. aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots
18587. on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin
18588. coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head with
18589. its broad temples and close-cropped hair, and looked at Bezukhov. The
18590. stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He
18591. felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his
18592. mind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his
18593. eyes. His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of
18594. them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a
18595. death's head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as
18596. it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant
18597. was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,
18598. evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown.
18599. This active old servant was unpacking the traveler's canteen and
18600. preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was
18601. ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a
18602. tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom
18603. he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the
18604. need, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this
18605. stranger.
18606. 
18607. The servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down, * with an
18608. unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be
18609. wanted.
18610. 
18611. 
18612.     * To indicate he did not want more tea.
18613. 
18614. 
18615. "No. Give me the book," said the stranger.
18616. 
18617. The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work,
18618. and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at
18619. once the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and again,
18620. leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his former
18621. position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time
18622. to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and
18623. severe gaze straight on Pierre's face.
18624. 
18625. Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old
18626. eyes attracted him irresistibly.
18627. 
18628. 
18629. 
18630. 
18631. 
18632. CHAPTER II
18633. 
18634. 
18635. "I have the pleasure of addressing Count Bezukhov, if I am not
18636. mistaken," said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice.
18637. 
18638. Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.
18639. 
18640. "I have heard of you, my dear sir," continued the stranger, "and of your
18641. misfortune." He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to say--"Yes,
18642. misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what happened to you in
18643. Moscow was a misfortune."--"I regret it very much, my dear sir."
18644. 
18645. Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent
18646. forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.
18647. 
18648. "I have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for
18649. greater reasons."
18650. 
18651. He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way
18652. of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant
18653. to enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him
18654. involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him.
18655. 
18656. "You are unhappy, my dear sir," the stranger continued. "You are young
18657. and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my power."
18658. 
18659. "Oh, yes!" said Pierre, with a forced smile. "I am very grateful to you.
18660. Where are you traveling from?"
18661. 
18662. The stranger's face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but
18663. in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
18664. irresistibly attractive to Pierre.
18665. 
18666. "But if for reason you don't feel inclined to talk to me," said the old
18667. man, "say so, my dear sir." And he suddenly smiled, in an unexpected and
18668. tenderly paternal way.
18669. 
18670. "Oh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your
18671. acquaintance," said Pierre. And again, glancing at the stranger's hands,
18672. he looked more closely at the ring, with its skull--a Masonic sign.
18673. 
18674. "Allow me to ask," he said, "are you a Mason?"
18675. 
18676. "Yes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons," said the stranger,
18677. looking deeper and deeper into Pierre's eyes. "And in their name and my
18678. own I hold out a brotherly hand to you."
18679. 
18680. "I am afraid," said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the confidence
18681. the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own habit
18682. of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs--"I am afraid I am very far from
18683. understanding--how am I to put it?--I am afraid my way of looking at the
18684. world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another."
18685. 
18686. "I know your outlook," said the Mason, "and the view of life you
18687. mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts,
18688. is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit
18689. of pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I
18690. had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a
18691. regrettable delusion."
18692. 
18693. "Just as I may suppose you to be deluded," said Pierre, with a faint
18694. smile.
18695. 
18696. "I should never dare to say that I know the truth," said the Mason,
18697. whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness.
18698. "No one can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying stone on stone
18699. with the cooperation of all, by the millions of generations from our
18700. forefather Adam to our own times, is that temple reared which is to be a
18701. worthy dwelling place of the Great God," he added, and closed his eyes.
18702. 
18703. "I ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not believe in God,"
18704. said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it essential to
18705. speak the whole truth.
18706. 
18707. The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with
18708. millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he, poor
18709. man, had not the five rubles that would make him happy.
18710. 
18711. "Yes, you do not know Him, my dear sir," said the Mason. "You cannot
18712. know Him. You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy."
18713. 
18714. "Yes, yes, I am unhappy," assented Pierre. "But what am I to do?"
18715. 
18716. "You know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You do not
18717. know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in thee,
18718. and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!" pronounced
18719. the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.
18720. 
18721. He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.
18722. 
18723. "If He were not," he said quietly, "you and I would not be speaking
18724. of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom hast thou
18725. denied?" he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in
18726. his voice. "Who invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came thy
18727. conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being? didst
18728. thou, and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the existence
18729. of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, and
18730. infinite in all His attributes?..."
18731. 
18732. He stopped and remained silent for a long time.
18733. 
18734. Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.
18735. 
18736. "He exists, but to understand Him is hard," the Mason began again,
18737. looking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves
18738. of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep
18739. still. "If it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could bring
18740. him to thee, could take him by the hand and show him to thee. But how
18741. can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity, and
18742. all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may not
18743. see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness and
18744. sinfulness?" He paused again. "Who art thou? Thou dreamest that thou art
18745. wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words," he went
18746. on, with a somber and scornful smile. "And thou art more foolish and
18747. unreasonable than a little child, who, playing with the parts of a
18748. skillfully made watch, dares to say that, as he does not understand
18749. its use, he does not believe in the master who made it. To know Him is
18750. hard.... For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to
18751. attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim; but
18752. in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His
18753. greatness...."
18754. 
18755. Pierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason's face with
18756. shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but believing with
18757. his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he accepted the wise
18758. reasoning contained in the Mason's words, or believed as a child
18759. believes, in the speaker's tone of conviction and earnestness, or the
18760. tremor of the speaker's voice--which sometimes almost broke--or those
18761. brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm firmness
18762. and certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole being (and
18763. which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and
18764. hopelessness)--at any rate, Pierre longed with his whole soul to believe
18765. and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort, regeneration,
18766. and return to life.
18767. 
18768. "He is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life," said the Mason.
18769. 
18770. "I do not understand," said Pierre, feeling with dismay doubts
18771. reawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in
18772. the Mason's arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him.
18773. "I don't understand," he said, "how it is that the mind of man cannot
18774. attain the knowledge of which you speak."
18775. 
18776. The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.
18777. 
18778. "The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to
18779. imbibe," he said. "Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel
18780. and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself can I
18781. retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive."
18782. 
18783. "Yes, yes, that is so," said Pierre joyfully.
18784. 
18785. "The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those worldly
18786. sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into which
18787. intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one. The
18788. highest wisdom has but one science--the science of the whole--the
18789. science explaining the whole creation and man's place in it. To receive
18790. that science it is necessary to purify and renew one's inner self, and
18791. so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to perfect one's
18792. self. And to attain this end, we have the light called conscience that
18793. God has implanted in our souls."
18794. 
18795. "Yes, yes," assented Pierre.
18796. 
18797. "Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask
18798. thyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained
18799. relying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich, you
18800. are clever, you are well educated. And what have you done with all these
18801. good gifts? Are you content with yourself and with your life?"
18802. 
18803. "No, I hate my life," Pierre muttered, wincing.
18804. 
18805. "Thou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and as thou art
18806. purified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir.
18807. How have you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving
18808. everything from society and giving nothing in return. You have become
18809. the possessor of wealth. How have you used it? What have you done
18810. for your neighbor? Have you ever thought of your tens of thousands
18811. of slaves? Have you helped them physically and morally? No! You have
18812. profited by their toil to lead a profligate life. That is what you have
18813. done. Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your
18814. neighbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness. Then you married,
18815. my dear sir--took on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young
18816. woman; and what have you done? You have not helped her to find the way
18817. of truth, my dear sir, but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and
18818. misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and you say you do not know
18819. God and hate your life. There is nothing strange in that, my dear sir!"
18820. 
18821. After these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, again
18822. leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre
18823. looked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face and moved
18824. his lips without uttering a sound. He wished to say, "Yes, a vile, idle,
18825. vicious life!" but dared not break the silence.
18826. 
18827. The Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his
18828. servant.
18829. 
18830. "How about the horses?" he asked, without looking at Pierre.
18831. 
18832. "The exchange horses have just come," answered the servant. "Will you
18833. not rest here?"
18834. 
18835. "No, tell them to harness."
18836. 
18837. "Can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me
18838. all, and without promising to help me?" thought Pierre, rising with
18839. downcast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at
18840. the Mason. "Yes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible
18841. and profligate life, though I did not like it and did not want to,"
18842. thought Pierre. "But this man knows the truth and, if he wished to,
18843. could disclose it to me."
18844. 
18845. Pierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The
18846. traveler, having packed his things with his practiced hands, began
18847. fastening his coat. When he had finished, he turned to Bezukhov, and
18848. said in a tone of indifferent politeness:
18849. 
18850. "Where are you going to now, my dear sir?"
18851. 
18852. "I?... I'm going to Petersburg," answered Pierre, in a childlike,
18853. hesitating voice. "I thank you. I agree with all you have said. But do
18854. not suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what you
18855. would have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it is
18856. I, above all, who am to blame for everything. Help me, teach me, and
18857. perhaps I may..."
18858. 
18859. Pierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.
18860. 
18861. The Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.
18862. 
18863. "Help comes from God alone," he said, "but such measure of help as
18864. our Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to
18865. Petersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski" (he took out his notebook and
18866. wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four). "Allow me
18867. to give you a piece of advice. When you reach the capital, first of all
18868. devote some time to solitude and self-examination and do not resume your
18869. former way of life. And now I wish you a good journey, my dear sir," he
18870. added, seeing that his servant had entered... "and success."
18871. 
18872. The traveler was Joseph Alexeevich Bazdeev, as Pierre saw from the
18873. postmaster's book. Bazdeev had been one of the best-known Freemasons and
18874. Martinists, even in Novikov's time. For a long while after he had gone,
18875. Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room,
18876. pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous sense of beginning
18877. anew pictured to himself the blissful, irreproachable, virtuous future
18878. that seemed to him so easy. It seemed to him that he had been vicious
18879. only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous. Not
18880. a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul. He firmly believed
18881. in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim
18882. of supporting one another in the path of virtue, and that is how
18883. Freemasonry presented itself to him.
18884. 
18885. 
18886. 
18887. 
18888. 
18889. CHAPTER III
18890. 
18891. 
18892. On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival, he
18893. went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas a Kempis, whose book
18894. had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing he continually realized
18895. as he read that book: the joy, hitherto unknown to him, of believing
18896. in the possibility of attaining perfection, and in the possibility of
18897. active brotherly love among men, which Joseph Alexeevich had revealed to
18898. him. A week after his arrival, the young Polish count, Willarski, whom
18899. Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society, came into his room
18900. one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in which Dolokhov's
18901. second had called on him, and, having closed the door behind him and
18902. satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room, addressed
18903. Pierre.
18904. 
18905. "I have come to you with a message and an offer, Count," he said without
18906. sitting down. "A person of very high standing in our Brotherhood has
18907. made application for you to be received into our Order before the usual
18908. term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I consider it a
18909. sacred duty to fulfill that person's wishes. Do you wish to enter the
18910. Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?"
18911. 
18912. The cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before met
18913. at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women,
18914. surprised Pierre.
18915. 
18916. "Yes, I do wish it," said he.
18917. 
18918. Willarski bowed his head.
18919. 
18920. "One more question, Count," he said, "which I beg you to answer in
18921. all sincerity--not as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you
18922. renounced your former convictions--do you believe in God?"
18923. 
18924. Pierre considered.
18925. 
18926. "Yes... yes, I believe in God," he said.
18927. 
18928. "In that case..." began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.
18929. 
18930. "Yes, I do believe in God," he repeated.
18931. 
18932. "In that case we can go," said Willarski. "My carriage is at your
18933. service."
18934. 
18935. Willarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre's inquiries as to
18936. what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied that
18937. brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to
18938. tell the truth.
18939. 
18940. Having entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its
18941. headquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small
18942. well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of
18943. a servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in strange
18944. attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him, said
18945. something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small
18946. wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen
18947. before. Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound
18948. Pierre's eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind, catching some hairs
18949. painfully in the knot. Then he drew his face down, kissed him, and
18950. taking him by the hand led him forward. The hairs tied in the knot hurt
18951. Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile.
18952. His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a puckered, though
18953. smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.
18954. 
18955. Having led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.
18956. 
18957. "Whatever happens to you," he said, "you must bear it all manfully
18958. if you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood." (Pierre nodded
18959. affirmatively.) "When you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover
18960. your eyes," added Willarski. "I wish you courage and success," and,
18961. pressing Pierre's hand, he went out.
18962. 
18963. Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice he
18964. shrugged his and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if wishing to take
18965. it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent with his eyes
18966. bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb, his legs almost gave
18967. way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He experienced a variety of
18968. most complex sensations. He felt afraid of what would happen to him and
18969. still more afraid of showing his fear. He felt curious to know what was
18970. going to happen and what would be revealed to him; but most of all, he
18971. felt joyful that the moment had come when he would at last start on that
18972. path of regeneration and on the actively virtuous life of which he had
18973. been dreaming since he met Joseph Alexeevich. Loud knocks were heard at
18974. the door. Pierre took the bandage off his eyes and glanced around him.
18975. The room was in black darkness, only a small lamp was burning inside
18976. something white. Pierre went nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a
18977. black table on which lay an open book. The book was the Gospel, and the
18978. white thing with the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and
18979. teeth. After reading the first words of the Gospel: "In the beginning
18980. was the Word and the Word was with God," Pierre went round the table and
18981. saw a large open box filled with something. It was a coffin with bones
18982. inside. He was not at all surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on
18983. an entirely new life quite unlike the old one, he expected everything
18984. to be unusual, even more unusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a
18985. coffin, the Gospel--it seemed to him that he had expected all this and
18986. even more. Trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around. "God,
18987. death, love, the brotherhood of man," he kept saying to himself,
18988. associating these words with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened and
18989. someone came in.
18990. 
18991. By the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, he
18992. saw rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the
18993. darkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the
18994. table and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.
18995. 
18996. This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and
18997. part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high
18998. white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from
18999. below.
19000. 
19001. "For what have you come hither?" asked the newcomer, turning in Pierre's
19002. direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. "Why have you, who do
19003. not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light,
19004. come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?"
19005. 
19006. At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a
19007. sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at
19008. confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete
19009. stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated
19010. breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the
19011. brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was
19012. known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew,
19013. Smolyaninov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an
19014. acquaintance--he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor.
19015. For a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had to
19016. repeat his question.
19017. 
19018. "Yes... I... I... desire regeneration," Pierre uttered with difficulty.
19019. 
19020. "Very well," said Smolyaninov, and went on at once: "Have you any idea
19021. of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your aim?"
19022. said he quietly and quickly.
19023. 
19024. "I... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration," said Pierre,
19025. with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his
19026. excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in
19027. Russian.
19028. 
19029. "What is your conception of Freemasonry?"
19030. 
19031. "I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who
19032. have virtuous aims," said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of
19033. his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. "I imagine..."
19034. 
19035. "Good!" said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with this answer.
19036. "Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?"
19037. 
19038. "No, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it," said Pierre,
19039. so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was
19040. saying. "I have been an atheist," answered Pierre.
19041. 
19042. "You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,
19043. therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?" said the Rhetor,
19044. after a moment's pause.
19045. 
19046. "Yes, yes," assented Pierre.
19047. 
19048. The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast,
19049. and began to speak.
19050. 
19051. "Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order," he said, "and
19052. if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood with
19053. profit. The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on which
19054. it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the preservation and
19055. handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery... which has come
19056. down to us from the remotest ages, even from the first man--a mystery on
19057. which perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this mystery is of
19058. such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by
19059. long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope to attain it
19060. quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing our members as
19061. much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify and enlighten their
19062. minds, by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven
19063. to attain this mystery, and thereby to render them capable of receiving
19064. it.
19065. 
19066. "By purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve
19067. the whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety
19068. and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which
19069. sways the world. Think this over and I will come to you again."
19070. 
19071. "To combat the evil which sways the world..." Pierre repeated, and a
19072. mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind.
19073. He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and he
19074. addressed an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself
19075. vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed,
19076. imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three
19077. objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind,
19078. especially appealed to Pierre. The important mystery mentioned by the
19079. Rhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem to him essential,
19080. and the second aim, that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not
19081. much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he
19082. was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all
19083. that was good.
19084. 
19085. Half an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the
19086. seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon's temple,
19087. which every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These virtues were:
19088. 1. Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. Obedience to
19089. those of higher ranks in the Order.  3. Morality.  4. Love of mankind.
19090. 5. Courage. 6. Generosity. 7. The love of death.
19091. 
19092. "In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death," the
19093. Rhetor said, "to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but
19094. as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue
19095. from this distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense and
19096. peace."
19097. 
19098. "Yes, that must be so," thought Pierre, when after these words the
19099. Rhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. "It must be so,
19100. but I am still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which is only
19101. now gradually opening before me." But five of the other virtues which
19102. Pierre recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt already in his
19103. soul: courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind, and especially
19104. obedience--which did not even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now
19105. felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will
19106. to those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot what the seventh
19107. virtue was and could not recall it.
19108. 
19109. The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre
19110. whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to
19111. all that would be required of him.
19112. 
19113. "I am ready for everything," said Pierre.
19114. 
19115. "I must also inform you," said the Rhetor, "that our Order delivers its
19116. teaching not in words only but also by other means, which may perhaps
19117. have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue
19118. than mere words. This chamber with what you see therein should already
19119. have suggested to your heart, if it is sincere, more than words could
19120. do. You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like
19121. method of enlightenment. Our Order imitates the ancient societies that
19122. explained their teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph," said the
19123. Rhetor, "is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but
19124. which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol."
19125. 
19126. Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He
19127. listened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his
19128. ordeal was about to begin.
19129. 
19130. "If you are resolved, I must begin your initiation," said the Rhetor
19131. coming closer to Pierre. "In token of generosity I ask you to give me
19132. all your valuables."
19133. 
19134. "But I have nothing here," replied Pierre, supposing that he was asked
19135. to give up all he possessed.
19136. 
19137. "What you have with you: watch, money, rings...."
19138. 
19139. Pierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage for
19140. some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that had been
19141. done, the Rhetor said:
19142. 
19143. "In token of obedience, I ask you to undress."
19144. 
19145. Pierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the
19146. Rhetor's instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre's left
19147. breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to
19148. above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also
19149. and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the
19150. trouble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him
19151. a slipper for his left foot. With a childlike smile of embarrassment,
19152. doubt, and self-derision, which appeared on his face against his will,
19153. Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart, before his
19154. brother Rhetor, and awaited his further commands.
19155. 
19156. "And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief
19157. passion," said the latter.
19158. 
19159. "My passion! I have had so many," replied Pierre.
19160. 
19161. "That passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path
19162. of virtue," said the Mason.
19163. 
19164. Pierre paused, seeking a reply.
19165. 
19166. "Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?" He
19167. went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give
19168. the pre-eminence.
19169. 
19170. "Women," he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.
19171. 
19172. The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this
19173. answer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that lay
19174. on the table, again bound his eyes.
19175. 
19176. "For the last time I say to you--turn all your attention upon yourself,
19177. put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in passion but
19178. in your own heart. The source of blessedness is not without us but
19179. within...."
19180. 
19181. Pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source
19182. of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion.
19183. 
19184. 
19185. 
19186. 
19187. 
19188. CHAPTER IV
19189. 
19190. 
19191. Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not
19192. the Rhetor but Pierre's sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his
19193. voice. To fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre
19194. replied: "Yes, yes, I agree," and with a beaming, childlike smile, his
19195. fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and
19196. one booted foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his
19197. bare chest. He was conducted from that room along passages that turned
19198. backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the
19199. Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was answered by the Masonic knock with
19200. mallets, the doors opened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was still
19201. blindfolded) questioned him as to who he was, when and where he was
19202. born, and so on. Then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded,
19203. and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his
19204. pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the
19205. universe, and of the courage with which he should endure toils and
19206. dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken of
19207. now as the "Seeker," now as the "Sufferer," and now as the "Postulant,"
19208. to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords. As he
19209. was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty
19210. among his conductors. He heard those around him disputing in whispers
19211. and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet.
19212. After that they took his right hand, placed it on something, and told
19213. him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand
19214. and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the
19215. laws of the Order. The candles were then extinguished and some spirit
19216. lighted, as Pierre knew by the smell, and he was told that he would now
19217. see the lesser light. The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by the
19218. faint light of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, saw several
19219. men standing before him, wearing aprons like the Rhetor's and holding
19220. swords in their hands pointed at his breast. Among them stood a man
19221. whose white shirt was stained with blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved
19222. forward with his breast toward the swords, meaning them to pierce it.
19223. But the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded
19224. again.
19225. 
19226. "Now thou hast seen the lesser light," uttered a voice. Then the candles
19227. were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the bandage
19228. was again removed and more than ten voices said together: "Sic transit
19229. gloria mundi."
19230. 
19231. Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room
19232. and at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some
19233. twelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them
19234. Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the President's chair sat a
19235. young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck.
19236. On his right sat the Italian abbe whom Pierre had met at Anna Pavlovna's
19237. two years before. There were also present a very distinguished dignitary
19238. and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kuragins'. All maintained
19239. a solemn silence, listening to the words of the President, who held a
19240. mallet in his hand. Let into the wall was a star-shaped light. At one
19241. side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon
19242. it, at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a
19243. Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven large candlesticks like
19244. those used in churches. Two of the brothers led Pierre up to the altar,
19245. placed his feet at right angles, and bade him lie down, saying that he
19246. must prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple.
19247. 
19248. "He must first receive the trowel," whispered one of the brothers.
19249. 
19250. "Oh, hush, please!" said another.
19251. 
19252. Pierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without
19253. obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. "Where am I? What am
19254. I doing? Aren't they laughing at me? Shan't I be ashamed to remember
19255. this?" But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at the
19256. serious faces of those around, remembered all he had already gone
19257. through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast
19258. at his hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling,
19259. prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the
19260. feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before. When
19261. he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white leather
19262. apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a trowel
19263. and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him. He
19264. told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that
19265. apron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the unexplained
19266. trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice,
19267. and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor. As to the
19268. first pair of gloves, a man's, he said that Pierre could not know their
19269. meaning but must keep them. The second pair of man's gloves he was
19270. to wear at the meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of women's
19271. gloves, he said: "Dear brother, these woman's gloves are intended for
19272. you too. Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all. This
19273. gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to
19274. be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry." And after a pause, he added: "But
19275. beware, dear brother, that these gloves do not deck hands that are
19276. unclean." While the Grand Master said these last words it seemed
19277. to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierre himself grew still more
19278. confused, blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes, began
19279. looking about him uneasily, and an awkward pause followed.
19280. 
19281. This silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the
19282. rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of
19283. all the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a
19284. trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and
19285. so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of
19286. the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit down.
19287. The Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very long, and
19288. Pierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to
19289. understand what was being read. He managed to follow only the last words
19290. of the statutes and these remained in his mind.
19291. 
19292. "In our temples we recognize no other distinctions," read the Grand
19293. Master, "but those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any
19294. distinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother's aid whoever
19295. he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth, never
19296. bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous.
19297. Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy
19298. neighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy
19299. enemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling
19300. the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which
19301. thou hast lost."
19302. 
19303. He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with tears
19304. of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the
19305. congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all
19306. sides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only
19307. brothers, and burned with impatience to set to work with them.
19308. 
19309. The Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down in
19310. their places, and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of
19311. humility.
19312. 
19313. The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed, and
19314. the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of "Collector of Alms"
19315. went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked to subscribe all
19316. he had, but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same
19317. amount as the others.
19318. 
19319. The meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had
19320. returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had
19321. become completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits
19322. and way of life.
19323. 
19324. 
19325. 
19326. 
19327. 
19328. CHAPTER V
19329. 
19330. 
19331. The day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was sitting at
19332. home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square,
19333. one side of which symbolized God, another moral things, a third
19334. physical things, and the fourth a combination of these. Now and then
19335. his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in
19336. imagination a new plan of life. On the previous evening at the Lodge, he
19337. had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it
19338. would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his
19339. estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs. He
19340. was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince Vasili suddenly entered
19341. the room.
19342. 
19343. "My dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you
19344. quarreled with Helene, mon cher? You are under a delusion," said
19345. Prince Vasili, as he entered. "I know all about it, and I can tell you
19346. positively that Helene is as innocent before you as Christ was before
19347. the Jews."
19348. 
19349. Pierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasili interrupted him.
19350. 
19351. "And why didn't you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I know
19352. all about it and understand it all," he said. "You behaved as becomes
19353. a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won't go into
19354. that. But consider the position in which you are placing her and me
19355. in the eyes of society, and even of the court," he added, lowering his
19356. voice. "She is living in Moscow and you are here. Remember, dear boy,"
19357. and he drew Pierre's arm downwards, "it is simply a misunderstanding. I
19358. expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her a letter at once, and
19359. she'll come here and all will be explained, or else, my dear boy, let me
19360. tell you it's quite likely you'll have to suffer for it."
19361. 
19362. Prince Vasili gave Pierre a significant look.
19363. 
19364. "I know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a keen
19365. interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to Helene."
19366. 
19367. Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince Vasili did
19368. not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to speak
19369. in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly
19370. resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words of the Masonic
19371. statutes, "be kindly and courteous," recurred to him. He blinked, went
19372. red, got up and sat down again, struggling with himself to do what was
19373. for him the most difficult thing in life--to say an unpleasant thing
19374. to a man's face, to say what the other, whoever he might be, did not
19375. expect. He was so used to submitting to Prince Vasili's tone of careless
19376. self-assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now, but
19377. he also felt that on what he said now his future depended--whether he
19378. would follow the same old road, or that new path so attractively shown
19379. him by the Masons, on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a
19380. new life.
19381. 
19382. "Now, dear boy," said Prince Vasili playfully, "say 'yes,' and I'll
19383. write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf."
19384. 
19385. But before Prince Vasili had finished his playful speech, Pierre,
19386. without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his
19387. father, muttered in a whisper:
19388. 
19389. "Prince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!" And he jumped up and
19390. opened the door for him.
19391. 
19392. "Go!" he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of
19393. confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vasili's face.
19394. 
19395. "What's the matter with you? Are you ill?"
19396. 
19397. "Go!" the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vasili had to go without
19398. receiving any explanation.
19399. 
19400. A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons,
19401. and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his
19402. estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons
19403. and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.
19404. 
19405. 
19406. 
19407. 
19408. 
19409. CHAPTER VI
19410. 
19411. 
19412. The duel between Pierre and Dolokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the
19413. Emperor's severity regarding duels at that time, neither the principals
19414. nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel, confirmed
19415. by Pierre's rupture with his wife, was the talk of society. Pierre
19416. who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an
19417. illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best match
19418. in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his
19419. marriage--when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing
19420. to hope from him--especially as he did not know how, and did not wish,
19421. to court society's favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had happened,
19422. he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits
19423. of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierre's departure Helene returned
19424. to Petersburg, she was received by all her acquaintances not only
19425. cordially, but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune.
19426. When conversation turned on her husband Helene assumed a dignified
19427. expression, which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she
19428. did not understand its significance. This expression suggested that she
19429. had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband
19430. was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince Vasili expressed his opinion
19431. more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and,
19432. pointing to his forehead, remarked:
19433. 
19434. "A bit touched--I always said so."
19435. 
19436. "I said from the first," declared Anna Pavlovna referring to Pierre, "I
19437. said at the time and before anyone else" (she insisted on her priority)
19438. "that that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of
19439. these days. I said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures
19440. about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and when, if you
19441. remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees. And how has
19442. it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold all that
19443. has happened."
19444. 
19445. Anna Pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of
19446. soirees as before--such as she alone had the gift of arranging--at which
19447. was to be found "the cream of really good society, the bloom of the
19448. intellectual essence of Petersburg," as she herself put it. Besides
19449. this refined selection of society Anna Pavlovna's receptions were
19450. also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and
19451. interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state
19452. of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court society so
19453. dearly and distinctly indicated.
19454. 
19455. Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon's
19456. destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstadt and the surrender
19457. of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our troops
19458. had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon was
19459. beginning, Anna Pavlovna gave one of her soirees. The "cream of really
19460. good society" consisted of the fascinating Helene, forsaken by her
19461. husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had just
19462. returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a young man
19463. referred to in that drawing room as "a man of great merit" (un homme de
19464. beaucoup de merite), a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother, and
19465. several other less noteworthy persons.
19466. 
19467. The novelty Anna Pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening was
19468. Boris Drubetskoy, who had just arrived as a special messenger from the
19469. Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.
19470. 
19471. The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that
19472. evening was this:
19473. 
19474. "Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance
19475. Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance and
19476. mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not cease
19477. to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the
19478. King of Prussia and others: 'So much the worse for you. Tu l'as voulu,
19479. George Dandin,' that's all we have to say about it!"
19480. 
19481. When Boris, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing
19482. room, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided
19483. by Anna Pavlovna, was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and
19484. the hope of an alliance with her.
19485. 
19486. Boris, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed,
19487. entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an
19488. aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and
19489. then brought back to the general circle.
19490. 
19491. Anna Pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to
19492. several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered description
19493. of each.
19494. 
19495. "Prince Hippolyte Kuragin, M. Krug, the charge d'affaires from
19496. Copenhagen--a profound intellect," and simply, "Mr. Shitov--a man of
19497. great merit"--this of the man usually so described.
19498. 
19499. Thanks to Anna Mikhaylovna's efforts, his own tastes, and the
19500. peculiarities of his reserved nature, Boris had managed during his
19501. service to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a
19502. very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to
19503. Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had
19504. become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had
19505. been so pleased at Olmutz and according to which an ensign might rank
19506. incomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was
19507. needed for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or
19508. perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can
19509. grant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his
19510. success and at the inability of others to understand these things.
19511. In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all
19512. his relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were
19513. completely altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to
19514. be better dressed than others, and would rather deprive himself of many
19515. pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear
19516. in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. He made friends with
19517. and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and
19518. who could therefore be of use to him. He liked Petersburg and despised
19519. Moscow. The remembrance of the Rostovs' house and of his childish love
19520. for Natasha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the
19521. Rostovs since the day of his departure for the army. To be in Anna
19522. Pavlovna's drawing room he considered an important step up in the
19523. service, and he at once understood his role, letting his hostess make
19524. use of whatever interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned
19525. each face, appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with
19526. each of those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took the
19527. seat indicated to him beside the fair Helene and listened to the general
19528. conversation.
19529. 
19530. "Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that
19531. not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them, and
19532. she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the actual phrase
19533. used by the Vienna cabinet," said the Danish charge d'affaires.
19534. 
19535. "The doubt is flattering," said "the man of profound intellect," with a
19536. subtle smile.
19537. 
19538. "We must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of
19539. Austria," said Mortemart. "The Emperor of Austria can never have thought
19540. of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it."
19541. 
19542. "Ah, my dear vicomte," put in Anna Pavlovna, "L'Urope" (for some
19543. reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined French
19544. pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a
19545. Frenchman), "L'Urope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere." *
19546. 
19547. 
19548.     * "Europe will never be our sincere ally."
19549. 
19550. 
19551. After that Anna Pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King
19552. of Prussia, in order to draw Boris into the conversation.
19553. 
19554. Boris listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his turn,
19555. but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor, the
19556. beautiful Helene, whose eyes several times met those of the handsome
19557. young aide-de-camp with a smile.
19558. 
19559. Speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pavlovna very naturally asked
19560. Boris to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he
19561. found the Prussian army. Boris, speaking with deliberation, told them in
19562. pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies and the
19563. court, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about
19564. the facts he was recounting. For some time he engrossed the general
19565. attention, and Anna Pavlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was
19566. received with pleasure by all her visitors. The greatest attention
19567. of all to Boris' narrative was shown by Helene. She asked him several
19568. questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state
19569. of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished she turned to him with
19570. her usual smile.
19571. 
19572. "You absolutely must come and see me," she said in a tone that implied
19573. that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was
19574. absolutely necessary.
19575. 
19576. "On Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure."
19577. 
19578. Boris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation
19579. with her, when Anna Pavlovna called him away on the pretext that her
19580. aunt wished to hear him.
19581. 
19582. "You know her husband, of course?" said Anna Pavlovna, closing her eyes
19583. and indicating Helene with a sorrowful gesture. "Ah, she is such an
19584. unfortunate and charming woman! Don't mention him before her--please
19585. don't! It is too painful for her!"
19586. 
19587. 
19588. 
19589. 
19590. 
19591. CHAPTER VII
19592. 
19593. 
19594. When Boris and Anna Pavlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte had
19595. the ear of the company.
19596. 
19597. Bending forward in his armchair he said: "Le Roi de Prusse!" and having
19598. said this laughed. Everyone turned toward him.
19599. 
19600. "Le Roi de Prusse?" Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing, and
19601. then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna Pavlovna waited
19602. for him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she
19603. began to tell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the
19604. sword of Frederick the Great.
19605. 
19606. "It is the sword of Frederick the Great which I..." she began, but
19607. Hippolyte interrupted her with the words: "Le Roi de Prusse..." and
19608. again, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no
19609. more.
19610. 
19611. Anna Pavlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyte's friend, addressed him
19612. firmly.
19613. 
19614. "Come now, what about your Roi de Prusse?"
19615. 
19616. Hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.
19617. 
19618. "Oh, it's nothing. I only wished to say..." (he wanted to repeat a joke
19619. he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to
19620. get in) "I only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le Roi de
19621. Prusse!"
19622. 
19623. Boris smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical or
19624. appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody
19625. laughed.
19626. 
19627. "Your joke is too bad, it's witty but unjust," said Anna Pavlovna,
19628. shaking her little shriveled finger at him.
19629. 
19630. "We are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles.
19631. Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!" she said.
19632. 
19633. The conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the
19634. political news. It became particularly animated toward the end of the
19635. evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned.
19636. 
19637. "You know N-- N-- received a snuffbox with the portrait last year?" said
19638. "the man of profound intellect." "Why shouldn't S-- S-- get the same
19639. distinction?"
19640. 
19641. "Pardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperor's portrait is a reward but not a
19642. distinction," said the diplomatist--"a gift, rather."
19643. 
19644. "There are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg."
19645. 
19646. "It's impossible," replied another.
19647. 
19648. "Will you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter...."
19649. 
19650. When everybody rose to go, Helene who had spoken very little all
19651. the evening again turned to Boris, asking him in a tone of caressing
19652. significant command to come to her on Tuesday.
19653. 
19654. "It is of great importance to me," she said, turning with a smile toward
19655. Anna Pavlovna, and Anna Pavlovna, with the same sad smile with which she
19656. spoke of her exalted patroness, supported Helene's wish.
19657. 
19658. It seemed as if from some words Boris had spoken that evening about the
19659. Prussian army, Helene had suddenly found it necessary to see him. She
19660. seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on
19661. Tuesday.
19662. 
19663. But on Tuesday evening, having come to Helene's splendid salon, Boris
19664. received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to
19665. come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to him, and
19666. only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a
19667. whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face: "Come to dinner tomorrow... in
19668. the evening. You must come.... Come!"
19669. 
19670. During that stay in Petersburg, Boris became an intimate in the
19671. countess' house.
19672. 
19673. 
19674. 
19675. 
19676. 
19677. CHAPTER VIII
19678. 
19679. 
19680. The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier. Everywhere
19681. one heard curses on Bonaparte, "the enemy of mankind." Militiamen and
19682. recruits were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of
19683. war came contradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously
19684. interpreted. The life of old Prince Bolkonski, Prince Andrew, and
19685. Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.
19686. 
19687. In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief
19688. then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia.
19689. Despite the weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable
19690. since the time when he thought his son had been killed, he did not think
19691. it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor
19692. himself, and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy
19693. and strength. He was continually traveling through the three provinces
19694. entrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe
19695. to cruelty with his subordinates, and went into everything down to the
19696. minutest details himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in
19697. mathematics from her father, and when the old prince was at home went
19698. to his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his
19699. grandfather called him). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet
19700. nurse and nurse Savishna in the late princess' rooms and Princess Mary
19701. spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a mother's place to her
19702. little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed
19703. passionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself
19704. to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel--as she
19705. called her nephew--and playing with him.
19706. 
19707. Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the
19708. tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument
19709. brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
19710. fly upwards. The angel's upper lip was slightly raised as though
19711. about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and
19712. Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angel's face reminded
19713. them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger,
19714. though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the
19715. expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel's face, Prince
19716. Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead
19717. wife: "Ah, why have you done this to me?"
19718. 
19719. Soon after Prince Andrew's return the old prince made over to him a
19720. large estate, Bogucharovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills.
19721. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills,
19722. partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with
19723. his father's peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude,
19724. Prince Andrew made use of Bogucharovo, began building and spent most of
19725. his time there.
19726. 
19727. After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not
19728. to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced
19729. and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the
19730. recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son
19731. seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man,
19732. roused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign,
19733. while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and
19734. secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.
19735. 
19736. On February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits.
19737. Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father's
19738. absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who
19739. had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters
19740. for Prince Andrew.
19741. 
19742. Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the
19743. letters to Princess Mary's apartments, but did not find him there. He
19744. was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.
19745. 
19746. "If you please, your excellency, Petrusha has brought some papers,"
19747. said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a child's
19748. little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he poured drops
19749. from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.
19750. 
19751. "What is it?" he said crossly, and, his hand shaking unintentionally,
19752. he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the mixture onto the
19753. floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought it.
19754. 
19755. There were in the room a child's cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a
19756. table, a child's table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew was
19757. sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was burning on the
19758. table, screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall on
19759. the cot.
19760. 
19761. "My dear," said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside the
19762. cot where she was standing, "better wait a bit... later..."
19763. 
19764. "Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things
19765. off--and this is what comes of it!" said Prince Andrew in an exasperated
19766. whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.
19767. 
19768. "My dear, really... it's better not to wake him... he's asleep," said
19769. the princess in a tone of entreaty.
19770. 
19771. Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass
19772. in hand.
19773. 
19774. "Perhaps we'd really better not wake him," he said hesitating.
19775. 
19776. "As you please... really... I think so... but as you please," said
19777. Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had
19778. prevailed. She drew her brother's attention to the maid who was calling
19779. him in a whisper.
19780. 
19781. It was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy
19782. who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household
19783. doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had
19784. been trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness
19785. and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and
19786. reproached and disputed with each other.
19787. 
19788. "Petrusha has come with papers from your father," whispered the maid.
19789. 
19790. Prince Andrew went out.
19791. 
19792. "Devil take them!" he muttered, and after listening to the verbal
19793. instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his
19794. father's letter, he returned to the nursery.
19795. 
19796. "Well?" he asked.
19797. 
19798. "Still the same. Wait, for heaven's sake. Karl Ivanich always says that
19799. sleep is more important than anything," whispered Princess Mary with a
19800. sigh.
19801. 
19802. Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.
19803. 
19804. "Confound you and your Karl Ivanich!" He took the glass with the drops
19805. and again went up to the cot.
19806. 
19807. "Andrew, don't!" said Princess Mary.
19808. 
19809. But he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes,
19810. and stooped glass in hand over the infant.
19811. 
19812. "But I wish it," he said. "I beg you--give it him!"
19813. 
19814. Princess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively
19815. and calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed
19816. hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sat
19817. down on a sofa in the next room.
19818. 
19819. He still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically he
19820. began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote
19821. in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:
19822. 
19823. 
19824. Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful news--if
19825. it's not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory
19826. over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing, and
19827. the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a German--I
19828. congratulate him! I can't make out what the commander at Korchevo--a
19829. certain Khandrikov--is up to; till now the additional men and provisions
19830. have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and say I'll have his head
19831. off if everything is not here in a week. Have received another letter
19832. about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from Petenka--he took part in it--and
19833. it's all true. When mischief-makers don't meddle even a German beats
19834. Buonaparte. He is said to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop
19835. off to Korchevo without delay and carry out instructions!
19836. 
19837. 
19838. Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was
19839. a closely written letter of two sheets from Bilibin. He folded it up
19840. without reading it and reread his father's letter, ending with the
19841. words: "Gallop off to Korchevo and carry out instructions!"
19842. 
19843. "No, pardon me, I won't go now till the child is better," thought he,
19844. going to the door and looking into the nursery.
19845. 
19846. Princess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.
19847. 
19848. "Ah yes, and what else did he say that's unpleasant?" thought Prince
19849. Andrew, recalling his father's letter. "Yes, we have gained a victory
19850. over Bonaparte, just when I'm not serving. Yes, yes, he's always poking
19851. fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!" And he began reading Bilibin's letter
19852. which was written in French. He read without understanding half of it,
19853. read only to forget, if but for a moment, what he had too long been
19854. thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else.
19855. 
19856. 
19857. 
19858. 
19859. 
19860. CHAPTER IX
19861. 
19862. 
19863. Bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and
19864. though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms,
19865. he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and
19866. self-derision genuinely Russian. Bilibin wrote that the obligation of
19867. diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince
19868. Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he
19869. had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army.
19870. The letter was old, having been written before the battle at
19871. Preussisch-Eylau.
19872. 
19873. "Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz," wrote Bilibin,
19874. "as you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I have
19875. certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for me; what
19876. I have seen during these last three months is incredible.
19877. 
19878. "I begin ab ovo. 'The enemy of the human race,' as you know, attacks the
19879. Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed
19880. us three times in three years. We take up their cause, but it turns out
19881. that 'the enemy of the human race' pays no heed to our fine speeches
19882. and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without
19883. giving them time to finish the parade they had begun, and in two twists
19884. of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the
19885. palace at Potsdam.
19886. 
19887. "'I most ardently desire,' writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte,
19888. 'that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a
19889. manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances allowed, I
19890. have hastened to take all steps to that end. May I have succeeded!' The
19891. Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the French and lay
19892. down their arms at the first demand.
19893. 
19894. "The head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the
19895. King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All
19896. this is absolutely true.
19897. 
19898. "In short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude, it
19899. turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more, in
19900. war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have
19901. everything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely,
19902. a commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success
19903. might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so
19904. young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of Prozorovski
19905. and Kamenski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us,
19906. Suvorov-like, in a kibitka, and is received with acclamations of joy and
19907. triumph.
19908. 
19909. "On the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails
19910. are taken to the field marshal's room, for he likes to do everything
19911. himself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant
19912. for us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed
19913. to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field marshal grows
19914. impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor
19915. to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild
19916. furies and rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens
19917. them, and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others. 'Ah! So
19918. that's the way they treat me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep
19919. an eye on me! Very well then! Get along with you!' So he writes the
19920. famous order of the day to General Bennigsen:
19921. 
19922. 'I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army.
19923. You have brought your army corps to Pultusk, routed: here it is exposed,
19924. and without fuel or forage, so something must be done, and, as you
19925. yourself reported to Count Buxhowden yesterday, you must think of
19926. retreating to our frontier--which do today.'
19927. 
19928. "'From all my riding,' he writes to the Emperor, 'I have got a saddle
19929. sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents my
19930. riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the command
19931. to the general next in seniority, Count Buxhowden, having sent him my
19932. whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is a lack
19933. of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only one
19934. day's ration of bread remains, and in some regiments none at all, as
19935. reported by the division commanders, Ostermann and Sedmoretzki, and
19936. all that the peasants had has been eaten up. I myself will remain in
19937. hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover. In regard to which I humbly
19938. submit my report, with the information that if the army remains in its
19939. present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left
19940. in it by spring.
19941. 
19942. "'Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already
19943. in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and
19944. glorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious
19945. permission here in hospital, that I may not have to play the part of a
19946. secretary rather than commander in the army. My removal from the army
19947. does not produce the slightest stir--a blind man has left it. There are
19948. thousands such as I in Russia.'
19949. 
19950. "The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all,
19951. isn't it logical?
19952. 
19953. "This is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly
19954. interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal's departure it
19955. appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle.
19956. Buxhowden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does
19957. not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are
19958. within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to
19959. fight a battle 'on his own hand' as the Germans say. He does so. This
19960. is the battle of Pultusk, which is considered a great victory but in my
19961. opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very
19962. bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat
19963. after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is
19964. we who lost the battle of Pultusk. In short, we retreat after the battle
19965. but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General
19966. Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in
19967. chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of
19968. the army to General Buxhowden. During this interregnum we begin a very
19969. original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as
19970. it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid
19971. General Buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief. So
19972. energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable
19973. river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at
19974. the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxhowden. General Buxhowden was all but
19975. attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of
19976. these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him. Buxhowden pursues us--we
19977. scuttle. He hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to
19978. the other. At last our enemy. Buxhowden, catches us and attacks. Both
19979. generals are angry, and the result is a challenge on Buxhowden's part
19980. and an epileptic fit on Bennigsen's. But at the critical moment the
19981. courier who carried the news of our victory at Pultusk to Petersburg
19982. returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief, and our first
19983. foe, Buxhowden, is vanquished; we can now turn our thoughts to the
19984. second, Bonaparte. But as it turns out, just at that moment a third
19985. enemy rises before us--namely the Orthodox Russian soldiers, loudly
19986. demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot! The stores are
19987. empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looting, and in a way
19988. of which our last campaign can give you no idea. Half the regiments form
19989. bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword.
19990. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals overflow with
19991. sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the marauders even attack our
19992. headquarters, and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to
19993. disperse them. During one of these attacks they carried off my empty
19994. portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give all
19995. commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much fear
19996. this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other."
19997. 
19998. At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while,
19999. in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust
20000. Bilibin), what he had read began to interest him more and more. When he
20001. had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away. It was
20002. not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out
20003. there in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his eyes,
20004. rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he
20005. had read, and listened to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he
20006. thought he heard a strange noise through the door. He was seized with
20007. alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was
20008. reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it.
20009. 
20010. Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him
20011. with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.
20012. 
20013. "My dear," he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
20014. him.
20015. 
20016. As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was
20017. seized by an unreasoning panic--it occurred to him that the child was
20018. dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.
20019. 
20020. "All is over," he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead.
20021. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it empty and
20022. that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the curtain aside
20023. and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could not find the baby.
20024. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the
20025. bed with his head lower than the pillow, and was smacking his lips in
20026. his sleep and breathing evenly.
20027. 
20028. Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had
20029. already lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him,
20030. tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. The soft
20031. forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand; even
20032. the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was not dead,
20033. but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent. Prince Andrew
20034. longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless
20035. little creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing at his
20036. head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He
20037. heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of
20038. the cot. He did not look round, but still gazing at the infant's face
20039. listened to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Mary,
20040. who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain,
20041. and dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her without
20042. looking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.
20043. 
20044. "He has perspired," said Prince Andrew.
20045. 
20046. "I was coming to tell you so."
20047. 
20048. The child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead
20049. against the pillow.
20050. 
20051. Prince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her
20052. luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that
20053. were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly
20054. catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture
20055. and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing
20056. to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the
20057. world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair
20058. against the muslin of the curtain.
20059. 
20060. "Yes, this is the one thing left me now," he said with a sigh.
20061. 
20062. 
20063. 
20064. 
20065. 
20066. CHAPTER X
20067. 
20068. 
20069. Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the
20070. Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with
20071. him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to
20072. what he should do on his estates.
20073. 
20074. When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office
20075. and explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that steps
20076. would be taken immediately to free his serfs--and that till then they
20077. were not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies
20078. were not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs,
20079. punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals,
20080. asylums, and schools were to be established on all the estates. Some of
20081. the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with
20082. alarm, supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased
20083. with their management and embezzlement of money, some after their first
20084. fright were amused by Pierre's lisp and the new words they had not heard
20085. before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while the
20086. cleverest among them, including the chief steward, understood from this
20087. speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends.
20088. 
20089. The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre's intentions, but
20090. remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the
20091. general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.
20092. 
20093. Despite Count Bezukhov's enormous wealth, since he had come into an
20094. income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year,
20095. Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him
20096. an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the
20097. following budget:
20098. 
20099. About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about
20100. 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house,
20101. and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in
20102. pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to
20103. the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a
20104. new church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last
20105. two years, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was
20106. spent, and almost every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the
20107. chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests,
20108. or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first
20109. task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or
20110. inclination--practical business.
20111. 
20112. He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But
20113. he felt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these
20114. consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with
20115. them or make them move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state
20116. of things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the necessity of
20117. paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor,
20118. to which Pierre did not agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that
20119. steps should be taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by
20120. showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank,
20121. and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation.
20122. 
20123. The steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested selling
20124. the forests in the province of Kostroma, the land lower down the river,
20125. and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which
20126. operations according to him were connected with such complicated
20127. measures--the removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so
20128. on--that Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied:
20129. 
20130. "Yes, yes, do so."
20131. 
20132. Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him
20133. to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried
20134. to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward
20135. for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these
20136. consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to
20137. himself.
20138. 
20139. In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make
20140. his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the
20141. largest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierre's greatest
20142. weakness--the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the
20143. Lodge--were so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days,
20144. weeks, and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much
20145. occupied with evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him
20146. no time for reflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had
20147. hoped to lead he still lived the old life, only in new surroundings.
20148. 
20149. Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not
20150. fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral
20151. life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked two--morality and the love
20152. of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled
20153. another of the precepts--that of reforming the human race--and had other
20154. virtues--love of his neighbor, and especially generosity.
20155. 
20156. In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way he
20157. intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders
20158. had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had
20159. entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.
20160. 
20161. The chief steward, who considered the young count's attempts almost
20162. insane--unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfs--made
20163. some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as
20164. impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large buildings--schools,
20165. hospitals, and asylums--on all the estates before the master arrived.
20166. Everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes (which
20167. he knew Pierre would not like), but for just such gratefully religious
20168. ones, with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality,
20169. as, according to his understanding of his master, would touch and delude
20170. him.
20171. 
20172. The southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna
20173. carriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on
20174. Pierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque
20175. than the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly
20176. grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions,
20177. which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the
20178. depth of his heart. In one place the peasants presented him with bread
20179. and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission,
20180. as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them,
20181. to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor
20182. of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In another place the women with
20183. infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard
20184. work. On a third estate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet
20185. him surrounded by children whom, by the count's generosity, he was
20186. instructing in reading, writing, and religion. On all his estates Pierre
20187. saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection,
20188. all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon
20189. to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewards' accounts, according to
20190. which the serfs' manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the
20191. touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue
20192. coats.
20193. 
20194. What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
20195. with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and
20196. Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter's day,
20197. and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun
20198. the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in that
20199. villages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know that
20200. since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they
20201. did still harder work on their own land. He did not know that the priest
20202. who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and
20203. that the pupils' parents wept at having to let him take their children
20204. and secured their release by heavy payments. He did not know that the
20205. brick buildings, built to plan, were being built by serfs whose manorial
20206. labor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. He did not know that
20207. where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs' payments
20208. had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work had been
20209. increased by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his
20210. estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left
20211. Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his "brother-instructor"
20212. as he called the Grand Master.
20213. 
20214. "How easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,"
20215. thought Pierre, "and how little attention we pay to it!"
20216. 
20217. He was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at
20218. receiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
20219. for these simple, kindly people.
20220. 
20221. The chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
20222. through the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with
20223. a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre,
20224. pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all
20225. the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.
20226. 
20227. Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
20228. difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would
20229. happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly,
20230. on what he thought right. The steward promised to do all in his power
20231. to carry out the count's wishes, seeing clearly that not only would the
20232. count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for
20233. the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank,
20234. but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the
20235. newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued
20236. to give in money and work all that other people's serfs gave--that is to
20237. say, all that could be got out of them.
20238. 
20239. 
20240. 
20241. 
20242. 
20243. CHAPTER XI
20244. 
20245. 
20246. Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state
20247. of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his
20248. friend Bolkonski, whom he had not seen for two years.
20249. 
20250. Bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields
20251. and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The house lay
20252. behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks
20253. still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that stretched
20254. along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir
20255. trees.
20256. 
20257. The homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, a
20258. bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular facade
20259. still in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid
20260. out. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a
20261. water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight,
20262. the bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of
20263. tidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply
20264. to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly
20265. built lodge close to the pond. Anton, a man who had looked after Prince
20266. Andrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the
20267. prince was at home, and showed him into a clean little anteroom.
20268. 
20269. Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after
20270. the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in
20271. Petersburg.
20272. 
20273. He quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered
20274. wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but Anton
20275. ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.
20276. 
20277. "Well, what is it?" came a sharp, unpleasant voice.
20278. 
20279. "A visitor," answered Anton.
20280. 
20281. "Ask him to wait," and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back.
20282. 
20283. Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to
20284. face with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre
20285. embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek
20286. and looked at him closely.
20287. 
20288. "Well, I did not expect you, I am very glad," said Prince Andrew.
20289. 
20290. Pierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He
20291. was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a
20292. smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in
20293. spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous
20294. and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more
20295. manly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used
20296. to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged
20297. concentration on some one thought.
20298. 
20299. As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation,
20300. it was long before their conversation could settle on anything. They
20301. put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to
20302. be talked over at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on
20303. some of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans
20304. for the future, Pierre's journeys and occupations, the war, and so
20305. on. The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his
20306. friend's look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with
20307. which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful
20308. animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would
20309. have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not.
20310. The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his
20311. enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince
20312. Andrew's presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views,
20313. which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour.
20314. He checked himself, fearing to seem naive, yet he felt an irresistible
20315. desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite
20316. different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.
20317. 
20318. "I can't tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly
20319. know myself again."
20320. 
20321. "Yes, we have altered much, very much, since then," said Prince Andrew.
20322. 
20323. "Well, and you? What are your plans?"
20324. 
20325. "Plans!" repeated Prince Andrew ironically. "My plans?" he said, as if
20326. astonished at the word. "Well, you see, I'm building. I mean to settle
20327. here altogether next year...."
20328. 
20329. Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew's face, which
20330. had grown much older.
20331. 
20332. "No, I meant to ask..." Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him.
20333. 
20334. "But why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and
20335. all you have been doing on your estates."
20336. 
20337. Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far
20338. as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been
20339. made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre's story of what he had
20340. been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened not
20341. only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling
20342. him.
20343. 
20344. Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend's company and
20345. at last became silent.
20346. 
20347. "I'll tell you what, my dear fellow," said Prince Andrew, who evidently
20348. also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, "I am only
20349. bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am going back to
20350. my sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of course you know her
20351. already," he said, evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he
20352. now found nothing in common. "We will go after dinner. And would you now
20353. like to look round my place?"
20354. 
20355. They went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the political
20356. news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other
20357. intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of
20358. the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here,
20359. while on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future
20360. arrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:
20361. 
20362. "However, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then
20363. we'll set off."
20364. 
20365. At dinner, conversation turned on Pierre's marriage.
20366. 
20367. "I was very much surprised when I heard of it," said Prince Andrew.
20368. 
20369. Pierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said
20370. hurriedly: "I will tell you some time how it all happened. But you know
20371. it is all over, and forever."
20372. 
20373. "Forever?" said Prince Andrew. "Nothing's forever."
20374. 
20375. "But you know how it all ended, don't you? You heard of the duel?"
20376. 
20377. "And so you had to go through that too!"
20378. 
20379. "One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man," said
20380. Pierre.
20381. 
20382. "Why so?" asked Prince Andrew. "To kill a vicious dog is a very good
20383. thing really."
20384. 
20385. "No, to kill a man is bad--wrong."
20386. 
20387. "Why is it wrong?" urged Prince Andrew. "It is not given to man to know
20388. what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will err, and
20389. in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong."
20390. 
20391. "What does harm to another is wrong," said Pierre, feeling with pleasure
20392. that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused, had
20393. begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to his present
20394. state.
20395. 
20396. "And who has told you what is bad for another man?" he asked.
20397. 
20398. "Bad! Bad!" exclaimed Pierre. "We all know what is bad for ourselves."
20399. 
20400. "Yes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is
20401. something I cannot inflict on others," said Prince Andrew, growing more
20402. and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to
20403. Pierre. He spoke in French. "I only know two very real evils in life:
20404. remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of those evils. To
20405. live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now."
20406. 
20407. "And love of one's neighbor, and self-sacrifice?" began Pierre. "No, I
20408. can't agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and not to
20409. have to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for myself
20410. and ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least trying"
20411. (Pierre's modesty made him correct himself) "to live for others, only
20412. now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I shall not agree
20413. with you, and you do not really believe what you are saying." Prince
20414. Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.
20415. 
20416. "When you see my sister, Princess Mary, you'll get on with her," he
20417. said. "Perhaps you are right for yourself," he added after a short
20418. pause, "but everyone lives in his own way. You lived for yourself and
20419. say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you
20420. began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I lived for
20421. glory.--And after all what is glory? The same love of others, a desire
20422. to do something for them, a desire for their approval.--So I lived for
20423. others, and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have become
20424. calmer since I began to live only for myself."
20425. 
20426. "But what do you mean by living only for yourself?" asked Pierre,
20427. growing excited. "What about your son, your sister, and your father?"
20428. 
20429. "But that's just the same as myself--they are not others," explained
20430. Prince Andrew. "The others, one's neighbors, le prochain, as you and
20431. Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and evil. Le
20432. prochain--your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good."
20433. 
20434. And he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He
20435. evidently wished to draw him on.
20436. 
20437. "You are joking," replied Pierre, growing more and more excited. "What
20438. error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even doing a
20439. little--though I did very little and did it very badly? What evil can
20440. there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people like ourselves,
20441. were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond
20442. ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a
20443. comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, and
20444. consolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying
20445. of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be
20446. rendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum
20447. for the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a
20448. peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give
20449. them rest and leisure?" said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. "And I have
20450. done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done something
20451. toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action,
20452. and more than that, you can't make me believe that you do not think so
20453. yourself. And the main thing is," he continued, "that I know, and know
20454. for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure
20455. happiness in life."
20456. 
20457. "Yes, if you put it like that it's quite a different matter," said
20458. Prince Andrew. "I build a house and lay out a garden, and you build
20459. hospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But what's
20460. right and what's good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by
20461. us. Well, you want an argument," he added, "come on then."
20462. 
20463. They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served
20464. as a veranda.
20465. 
20466. "Come, let's argue then," said Prince Andrew, "You talk of schools," he
20467. went on, crooking a finger, "education and so forth; that is, you want
20468. to raise him" (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his
20469. cap) "from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs, while
20470. it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible, and
20471. that is just what you want to deprive him of. I envy him, but you
20472. want to make him what I am, without giving him my means. Then you say,
20473. 'lighten his toil.' But as I see it, physical labor is as essential to
20474. him, as much a condition of his existence, as mental activity is to you
20475. or me. You can't help thinking. I go to bed after two in the morning,
20476. thoughts come and I can't sleep but toss about till dawn, because I
20477. think and can't help thinking, just as he can't help plowing and mowing;
20478. if he didn't, he would go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could
20479. not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week, so
20480. he could not stand my physical idleness, but would grow fat and die.
20481. The third thing--what else was it you talked about?" and Prince Andrew
20482. crooked a third finger. "Ah, yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit,
20483. he is dying, and you come and bleed him and patch him up. He will drag
20484. about as a cripple, a burden to everybody, for another ten years. It
20485. would be far easier and simpler for him to die. Others are being born
20486. and there are plenty of them as it is. It would be different if you
20487. grudged losing a laborer--that's how I regard him--but you want to cure
20488. him from love of him. And he does not want that. And besides, what a
20489. notion that medicine ever cured anyone! Killed them, yes!" said he,
20490. frowning angrily and turning away from Pierre.
20491. 
20492. Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was
20493. evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he spoke
20494. readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His
20495. glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.
20496. 
20497. "Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful!" said Pierre. "I don't understand how
20498. one can live with such ideas. I had such moments myself not long ago, in
20499. Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I collapsed so that I don't
20500. live at all--everything seems hateful to me... myself most of all. Then
20501. I don't eat, don't wash... and how is it with you?..."
20502. 
20503. "Why not wash? That is not cleanly," said Prince Andrew; "on the
20504. contrary one must try to make one's life as pleasant as possible. I'm
20505. alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I can
20506. without hurting others."
20507. 
20508. "But with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit
20509. without moving, undertaking nothing...."
20510. 
20511. "Life as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do nothing,
20512. but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to
20513. choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get out of it.
20514. They could not understand that I have not the necessary qualifications
20515. for it--the kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness necessary for the
20516. position. Then there's this house, which must be built in order to
20517. have a nook of one's own in which to be quiet. And now there's this
20518. recruiting."
20519. 
20520. "Why aren't you serving in the army?"
20521. 
20522. "After Austerlitz!" said Prince Andrew gloomily. "No, thank you very
20523. much! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active Russian
20524. army. And I won't--not even if Bonaparte were here at Smolensk
20525. threatening Bald Hills--even then I wouldn't serve in the Russian army!
20526. Well, as I was saying," he continued, recovering his composure, "now
20527. there's this recruiting. My father is chief in command of the Third
20528. District, and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under
20529. him."
20530. 
20531. "Then you are serving?"
20532. 
20533. "I am."
20534. 
20535. He paused a little while.
20536. 
20537. "And why do you serve?"
20538. 
20539. "Why, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of
20540. his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too
20541. energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is
20542. terrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of
20543. the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late
20544. a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster's clerk at Yukhnovna
20545. hanged," said Prince Andrew with a smile. "So I am serving because I
20546. alone have any influence with my father, and now and then can save him
20547. from actions which would torment him afterwards."
20548. 
20549. "Well, there you see!"
20550. 
20551. "Yes, but it is not as you imagine," Prince Andrew continued. "I did
20552. not, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who
20553. had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been very
20554. glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my father--that again is for
20555. myself."
20556. 
20557. Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered feverishly
20558. while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no
20559. desire to do good to his neighbor.
20560. 
20561. "There now, you wish to liberate your serfs," he continued; "that is a
20562. very good thing, but not for you--I don't suppose you ever had anyone
20563. flogged or sent to Siberia--and still less for your serfs. If they are
20564. beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I don't suppose they are any the
20565. worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the stripes on
20566. their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is a good thing
20567. for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon themselves,
20568. stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being able to
20569. inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people I pity, and
20570. for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You may not have
20571. seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those traditions of
20572. unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable, become cruel and
20573. harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain themselves and grow more
20574. and more miserable."
20575. 
20576. Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking
20577. that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his father's
20578. case.
20579. 
20580. He did not reply.
20581. 
20582. "So that's what I'm sorry for--human dignity, peace of mind, purity, and
20583. not the serfs' backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave as you may,
20584. always remain the same backs and foreheads."
20585. 
20586. "No, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you," said
20587. Pierre.
20588. 
20589. 
20590. 
20591. 
20592. 
20593. CHAPTER XII
20594. 
20595. 
20596. In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to
20597. Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and
20598. then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.
20599. 
20600. Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in
20601. his husbandry.
20602. 
20603. Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and
20604. apparently immersed in his own thoughts.
20605. 
20606. He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did not
20607. see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and
20608. raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that
20609. Prince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching,
20610. and he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule
20611. what to him was precious and sacred.
20612. 
20613. "No, but why do you think so?" Pierre suddenly began, lowering his
20614. head and looking like a bull about to charge, "why do you think so? You
20615. should not think so."
20616. 
20617. "Think? What about?" asked Prince Andrew with surprise.
20618. 
20619. "About life, about man's destiny. It can't be so. I myself thought
20620. like that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don't smile.
20621. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it was:
20622. Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal, aspects of
20623. humanity."
20624. 
20625. And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince
20626. Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed
20627. from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood,
20628. and love.
20629. 
20630. "Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest
20631. is a dream," said Pierre. "Understand, my dear fellow, that outside this
20632. union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that
20633. nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out
20634. his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our
20635. fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up
20636. to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I
20637. have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of
20638. which is hidden in heaven," said Pierre.
20639. 
20640. Prince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to
20641. Pierre's words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented
20642. his catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the
20643. peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrew's eyes and by his silence,
20644. Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would
20645. not interrupt him or laugh at what he said.
20646. 
20647. They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to
20648. cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed on it,
20649. they also stepped on the raft.
20650. 
20651. Prince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at
20652. the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.
20653. 
20654. "Well, what do you think about it?" Pierre asked. "Why are you silent?"
20655. 
20656. "What do I think about it? I am listening to you. It's all very well....
20657. You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life, the
20658. destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who are we?
20659. Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see what you see?
20660. You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I don't see it."
20661. 
20662. Pierre interrupted him.
20663. 
20664. "Do you believe in a future life?" he asked.
20665. 
20666. "A future life?" Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no time
20667. to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he knew
20668. Prince Andrew's former atheistic convictions.
20669. 
20670. "You say you can't see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor could
20671. I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end
20672. of everything. On earth, here on this earth" (Pierre pointed to the
20673. fields), "there is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the universe,
20674. in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who are now
20675. the children of earth are--eternally--children of the whole universe.
20676. Don't I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole?
20677. Don't I feel that I form one link, one step, between the lower and
20678. higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the
20679. Deity--the Supreme Power if you prefer the term--is manifest? If I see,
20680. clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose
20681. it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther? I feel that I
20682. cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this world, but that I shall
20683. always exist and always have existed. I feel that beyond me and above me
20684. there are spirits, and that in this world there is truth."
20685. 
20686. "Yes, that is Herder's theory," said Prince Andrew, "but it is not that
20687. which can convince me, dear friend--life and death are what convince.
20688. What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound up with one's
20689. own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right"
20690. (Prince Andrew's voice trembled and he turned away), "and suddenly that
20691. being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to exist.... Why? It
20692. cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe there is.... That's
20693. what convinces, that is what has convinced me," said Prince Andrew.
20694. 
20695. "Yes, yes, of course," said Pierre, "isn't that what I'm saying?"
20696. 
20697. "No. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the
20698. necessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with
20699. someone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowhere, and
20700. you yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have looked
20701. in...."
20702. 
20703. "Well, that's it then! You know that there is a there and there is a
20704. Someone? There is the future life. The Someone is--God."
20705. 
20706. Prince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long since been
20707. taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half
20708. below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near
20709. the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen,
20710. coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.
20711. 
20712. "If there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and man's
20713. highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must live, we
20714. must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap
20715. of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there, in the Whole,"
20716. said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.
20717. 
20718. Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to
20719. Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the
20720. sun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness. Pierre
20721. became silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the
20722. current beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew felt as if the sound
20723. of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre's words, whispering:
20724. 
20725. "It is true, believe it."
20726. 
20727. He sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at
20728. Pierre's face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his superior
20729. friend.
20730. 
20731. "Yes, if it only were so!" said Prince Andrew. "However, it is time to
20732. get on," he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up at the sky
20733. to which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since Austerlitz saw
20734. that high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield;
20735. and something that had long been slumbering, something that was best
20736. within him, suddenly awoke, joyful and youthful, in his soul. It
20737. vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his
20738. life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop
20739. existed within him. His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince
20740. Andrew's life. Though outwardly he continued to live in the same old
20741. way, inwardly he began a new life.
20742. 
20743. 
20744. 
20745. 
20746. 
20747. CHAPTER XIII
20748. 
20749. 
20750. It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front
20751. entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the house,
20752. Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierre's attention to a commotion going
20753. on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her back,
20754. and a short, long-haired, young man in a black garment had rushed back
20755. to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up. Two women ran out after
20756. them, and all four, looking round at the carriage, ran in dismay up the
20757. steps of the back porch.
20758. 
20759. "Those are Mary's 'God's folk,'" said Prince Andrew. "They have mistaken
20760. us for my father. This is the one matter in which she disobeys him. He
20761. orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she receives them."
20762. 
20763. "But what are 'God's folk'?" asked Pierre.
20764. 
20765. Prince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet them,
20766. and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back
20767. soon.
20768. 
20769. The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.
20770. 
20771. Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept
20772. in perfect order and readiness for him in his father's house; he himself
20773. went to the nursery.
20774. 
20775. "Let us go and see my sister," he said to Pierre when he returned.
20776. "I have not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her 'God's
20777. folk.' It will serve her right, she will be confused, but you will see
20778. her 'God's folk.' It's really very curious."
20779. 
20780. "What are 'God's folk'?" asked Pierre.
20781. 
20782. "Come, and you'll see for yourself."
20783. 
20784. Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face
20785. when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon
20786. stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monk's
20787. cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near them, in an
20788. armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on
20789. her childlike face.
20790. 
20791. "Andrew, why didn't you warn me?" said the princess, with mild reproach,
20792. as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens.
20793. 
20794. "Charmee de vous voir. Je suis tres contente de vous voir," * she said
20795. to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child, and now
20796. his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above all
20797. his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She looked at
20798. him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, "I like you very
20799. much, but please don't laugh at my people." After exchanging the first
20800. greetings, they sat down.
20801. 
20802. 
20803.     * "Delighted to see you. I am very glad to see you."
20804. 
20805. 
20806. "Ah, and Ivanushka is here too!" said Prince Andrew, glancing with a
20807. smile at the young pilgrim.
20808. 
20809. "Andrew!" said Princess Mary, imploringly. "Il faut que vous sachiez que
20810. c'est une femme," * said Prince Andrew to Pierre.
20811. 
20812. "Andrew, au nom de Dieu!" *(2) Princess Mary repeated.
20813. 
20814. 
20815.      * "You must know that this is a woman."
20816. 
20817.      * (2) "For heaven's sake."
20818. 
20819. 
20820. It was evident that Prince Andrew's ironical tone toward the pilgrims
20821. and Princess Mary's helpless attempts to protect them were their
20822. customary long-established relations on the matter.
20823. 
20824. "Mais, ma bonne amie," said Prince Andrew, "vous devriez au contraire
20825. m'etre reconnaissante de ce que j'explique a Pierre votre intimite avec
20826. ce jeune homme." *
20827. 
20828. 
20829.      * "But, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to
20830.      me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young
20831.      man."
20832. 
20833. 
20834. "Really?" said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and
20835. seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him) into
20836. Ivanushka's face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked
20837. round at them all with crafty eyes.
20838. 
20839. Princess Mary's embarrassment on her people's account was quite
20840. unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, lowering
20841. her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup
20842. upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat
20843. quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered another cup of tea.
20844. Ivanushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked with sly womanish eyes from
20845. under her brows at the young men.
20846. 
20847. "Where have you been? To Kiev?" Prince Andrew asked the old woman.
20848. 
20849. "I have, good sir," she answered garrulously. "Just at Christmastime I
20850. was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the
20851. shrine of the saint. And now I'm from Kolyazin, master, where a great
20852. and wonderful blessing has been revealed."
20853. 
20854. "And was Ivanushka with you?"
20855. 
20856. "I go by myself, benefactor," said Ivanushka, trying to speak in a bass
20857. voice. "I only came across Pelageya in Yukhnovo..."
20858. 
20859. Pelageya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what
20860. she had seen.
20861. 
20862. "In Kolyazin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed."
20863. 
20864. "What is it? Some new relics?" asked Prince Andrew.
20865. 
20866. "Andrew, do leave off," said Princess Mary. "Don't tell him, Pelageya."
20867. 
20868. "No... why not, my dear, why shouldn't I? I like him. He is kind, he is
20869. one of God's chosen, he's a benefactor, he once gave me ten rubles, I
20870. remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (he's one of God's
20871. own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says, 'Why are you not
20872. going to the right place? Go to Kolyazin where a wonder-working icon of
20873. the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.' On hearing those words I said
20874. good-by to the holy folk and went."
20875. 
20876. All were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones,
20877. drawing in her breath.
20878. 
20879. "So I come, master, and the people say to me: 'A great blessing has been
20880. revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother, the
20881. Holy Virgin Mother of God'...."
20882. 
20883. "All right, all right, you can tell us afterwards," said Princess Mary,
20884. flushing.
20885. 
20886. "Let me ask her," said Pierre. "Did you see it yourselves?" he inquired.
20887. 
20888. "Oh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the face like
20889. the light of heaven, and from the blessed Mother's cheek it drops and
20890. drops...."
20891. 
20892. "But, dear me, that must be a fraud!" said Pierre, naively, who had
20893. listened attentively to the pilgrim.
20894. 
20895. "Oh, master, what are you saying?" exclaimed the horrified Pelageya,
20896. turning to Princess Mary for support.
20897. 
20898. "They impose on the people," he repeated.
20899. 
20900. "Lord Jesus Christ!" exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself. "Oh,
20901. don't speak so, master! There was a general who did not believe, and
20902. said, 'The monks cheat,' and as soon as he'd said it he went blind. And
20903. he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him
20904. and said, 'Believe in me and I will make you whole.' So he begged: 'Take
20905. me to her, take me to her.' It's the real truth I'm telling you, I saw
20906. it myself. So he was brought, quite blind, straight to her, and he goes
20907. up to her and falls down and says, 'Make me whole,' says he, 'and I'll
20908. give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me.' I saw it myself, master, the
20909. star is fixed into the icon. Well, and what do you think? He received
20910. his sight! It's a sin to speak so. God will punish you," she said
20911. admonishingly, turning to Pierre.
20912. 
20913. "How did the star get into the icon?" Pierre asked.
20914. 
20915. "And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?" said Prince
20916. Andrew, with a smile.
20917. 
20918. Pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.
20919. 
20920. "Oh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!" she began, her
20921. pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. "Master, what have you said? God
20922. forgive you!" And she crossed herself. "Lord forgive him! My dear, what
20923. does it mean?..." she asked, turning to Princess Mary. She got up
20924. and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She evidently felt
20925. frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such
20926. things could be said, and was at the same time sorry to have now to
20927. forgo the charity of this house.
20928. 
20929. "Now, why need you do it?" said Princess Mary. "Why did you come to
20930. me?..."
20931. 
20932. "Come, Pelageya, I was joking," said Pierre. "Princesse, ma parole,
20933. je n'ai pas voulu l'offenser. * I did not mean anything, I was only
20934. joking," he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense. "It
20935. was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking."
20936. 
20937. 
20938.     * "Princess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her."
20939. 
20940. 
20941. Pelageya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre's face there was such a look
20942. of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and
20943. now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.
20944. 
20945. 
20946. 
20947. 
20948. 
20949. CHAPTER XIV
20950. 
20951. 
20952. The pilgrim woman was appeased and, being encouraged to talk, gave a
20953. long account of Father Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that his
20954. hands smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks
20955. she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking
20956. some dried bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with the
20957. saints. "I'd pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to another.
20958. I'd sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and there was
20959. such peace all around, such blessedness, that one don't want to come
20960. out, even into the light of heaven again."
20961. 
20962. Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went
20963. out of the room, and then, leaving "God's folk" to finish their tea,
20964. Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.
20965. 
20966. "You are very kind," she said to him.
20967. 
20968. "Oh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them so
20969. well and have the greatest respect for them."
20970. 
20971. Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.
20972. 
20973. "I have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a
20974. brother," she said. "How do you find Andrew?" she added hurriedly, not
20975. giving him time to reply to her affectionate words. "I am very anxious
20976. about him. His health was better in the winter, but last spring his
20977. wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure. And
20978. I am also very much afraid for him spiritually. He has not a character
20979. like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our sorrows. He keeps
20980. it all within him. Today he is cheerful and in good spirits, but that
20981. is the effect of your visit--he is not often like that. If you could
20982. persuade him to go abroad. He needs activity, and this quiet regular
20983. life is very bad for him. Others don't notice it, but I see it."
20984. 
20985. Toward ten o'clock the men servants rushed to the front door, hearing
20986. the bells of the old prince's carriage approaching. Prince Andrew and
20987. Pierre also went out into the porch.
20988. 
20989. "Who's that?" asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out of the
20990. carriage.
20991. 
20992. "Ah! Very glad! Kiss me," he said, having learned who the young stranger
20993. was.
20994. 
20995. The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.
20996. 
20997. Before supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his father's study, found
20998. him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that a time
20999. would come when there would be no more wars. The old prince disputed it
21000. chaffingly, but without getting angry.
21001. 
21002. "Drain the blood from men's veins and put in water instead, then there
21003. will be no more war! Old women's nonsense--old women's nonsense!" he
21004. repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately on the shoulder, and
21005. then went up to the table where Prince Andrew, evidently not wishing
21006. to join in the conversation, was looking over the papers his father
21007. had brought from town. The old prince went up to him and began to talk
21008. business.
21009. 
21010. "The marshal, a Count Rostov, hasn't sent half his contingent. He
21011. came to town and wanted to invite me to dinner--I gave him a pretty
21012. dinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy," the old prince
21013. went on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. "A fine
21014. fellow--your friend--I like him! He stirs me up. Another says clever
21015. things and one doesn't care to listen, but this one talks rubbish yet
21016. stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps I'll come and sit
21017. with you at supper. We'll have another dispute. Make friends with my
21018. little fool, Princess Mary," he shouted after Pierre, through the door.
21019. 
21020. Only now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the
21021. strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm was
21022. not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family
21023. and with the household. With the stern old prince and the gentle, timid
21024. Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre at once felt
21025. like an old friend. They were all fond of him already. Not only Princess
21026. Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her
21027. most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old "Prince Nicholas" (as his
21028. grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in
21029. his arms, and Michael Ivanovich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him
21030. with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.
21031. 
21032. The old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierre's
21033. account. And during the two days of the young man's visit he was
21034. extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.
21035. 
21036. When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they
21037. began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new
21038. acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but
21039. what was good of him.
21040. 
21041. 
21042. 
21043. 
21044. 
21045. CHAPTER XV
21046. 
21047. 
21048. When returning from his leave, Rostov felt, for the first time, how
21049. close was the bond that united him to Denisov and the whole regiment.
21050. 
21051. On approaching it, Rostov felt as he had done when approaching his home
21052. in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of
21053. his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Dementyev and saw the
21054. picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavrushka gleefully shouted to his
21055. master, "The count has come!" and Denisov, who had been asleep on his
21056. bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him, and the
21057. officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rostov experienced
21058. the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his sister had
21059. embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak.
21060. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and precious as
21061. his parents' house.
21062. 
21063. When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had
21064. been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone
21065. out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests
21066. of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one
21067. narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of
21068. moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own
21069. place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was none of
21070. all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his right
21071. place and took mistaken decisions; here was no Sonya with whom he ought,
21072. or ought not, to have an explanation; here was no possibility of going
21073. there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours in the
21074. day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not that
21075. innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther
21076. from him than another; there were none of those uncertain and undefined
21077. money relations with his father, and nothing to recall that terrible
21078. loss to Dolokhov. Here, in the regiment, all was clear and simple.
21079. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one, our Pavlograd
21080. regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no concern of
21081. his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was lieutenant, who
21082. captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most of all, who was
21083. a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, one's pay came every four
21084. months, there was nothing to think out or decide, you had only to do
21085. nothing that was considered bad in the Pavlograd regiment and, when
21086. given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly, and definitely
21087. ordered--and all would be well.
21088. 
21089. Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental
21090. life, Rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to
21091. rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter
21092. for him, because, after his loss to Dolokhov (for which, in spite of all
21093. his family's efforts to console him, he could not forgive himself), he
21094. had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving, not as he
21095. had done before, but really well, and by being a perfectly first-rate
21096. comrade and officer--in a word, a splendid man altogether, a thing which
21097. seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the regiment.
21098. 
21099. After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents
21100. in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved
21101. to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his
21102. parents.
21103. 
21104. Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pultusk
21105. and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting
21106. the Emperor's arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.
21107. 
21108. The Pavlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had
21109. served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in
21110. Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the
21111. campaign. It had been neither at Pultusk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and,
21112. when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign,
21113. was attached to Platov's division.
21114. 
21115. Platov's division was acting independently of the main army. Several
21116. times parts of the Pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the
21117. enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot's
21118. carriages. In April the Pavlograds were stationed immovably for some
21119. weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.
21120. 
21121. A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke,
21122. and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the
21123. men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could
21124. arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages,
21125. searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.
21126. 
21127. Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled--if any
21128. remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken
21129. from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking
21130. anything from them, often gave them the last of their rations.
21131. 
21132. The Pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but had
21133. lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals,
21134. death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling
21135. that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able
21136. to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals.
21137. When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the
21138. ground that looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called
21139. "Mashka's sweet root." It was very bitter, but they wandered about the
21140. fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it, though
21141. they were ordered not to do so, as it was a noxious plant. That spring a
21142. new disease broke out among the soldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs,
21143. and face, which the doctors attributed to eating this root. But in spite
21144. of all this, the soldiers of Denisov's squadron fed chiefly on "Mashka's
21145. sweet root," because it was the second week that the last of the
21146. biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the
21147. last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.
21148. 
21149. The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched
21150. roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with tufts of
21151. felty winter hair.
21152. 
21153. Despite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living just
21154. as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the
21155. hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed their
21156. horses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in
21157. place of fodder, and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which
21158. they rose up hungry, joking about their nasty food and their hunger. As
21159. usual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before
21160. them naked; smoked, picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told
21161. and listened to stories of Potemkin's and Suvorov's campaigns, or to
21162. legends of Alesha the Sly, or the priest's laborer Mikolka.
21163. 
21164. The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,
21165. half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and,
21166. in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as
21167. before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was
21168. no food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles.
21169. The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because
21170. nothing certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague
21171. feeling that in the main it was going badly.
21172. 
21173. Rostov lived, as before, with Denisov, and since their furlough they had
21174. become more friendly than ever. Denisov never spoke of Rostov's family,
21175. but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, Rostov felt
21176. that the elder hussar's luckless love for Natasha played a part in
21177. strengthening their friendship. Denisov evidently tried to expose Rostov
21178. to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his safe
21179. return with evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in
21180. a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of
21181. provisions, Rostov found a family consisting of an old Pole and his
21182. daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad, hungry, too weak
21183. to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance. Rostov
21184. brought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and
21185. kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering. One of his
21186. comrades, talking of women, began chaffing Rostov, saying that he was
21187. more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he
21188. introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved. Rostov took the
21189. joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things to the
21190. officer that it was all Denisov could do to prevent a duel. When the
21191. officer had gone away, Denisov, who did not himself know what Rostov's
21192. relations with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid him for his
21193. quickness of temper, and Rostov replied:
21194. 
21195. "Say what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I can't tell you
21196. how it offended me... because... well, for that reason...."
21197. 
21198. Denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
21199. without looking at Rostov, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.
21200. 
21201. "Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostovs are!" he muttered, and Rostov noticed
21202. tears in his eyes.
21203. 
21204. 
21205. 
21206. 
21207. 
21208. CHAPTER XVI
21209. 
21210. 
21211. In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor's arrival,
21212. but Rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held at
21213. Bartenstein, as the Pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond that
21214. place.
21215. 
21216. They were bivouacking. Denisov and Rostov were living in an earth hut,
21217. dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The
21218. hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A
21219. trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep,
21220. and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out and
21221. these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room,
21222. in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board,
21223. lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On
21224. each side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two
21225. and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof
21226. was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench
21227. and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table.
21228. Denisov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron
21229. liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end, with a piece
21230. of (broken but mended) glass in it for a window. When it was very cold,
21231. embers from the soldiers' campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron
21232. on the steps in the "reception room"--as Denisov called that part of
21233. the hut--and it was then so warm that the officers, of whom there were
21234. always some with Denisov and Rostov, sat in their shirt sleeves.
21235. 
21236. In April, Rostov was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and
21237. eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed
21238. his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm,
21239. then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner, and,
21240. his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his
21241. shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his head. He was
21242. pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days
21243. for his last reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting Denisov, who
21244. had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.
21245. 
21246. Suddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut,
21247. evidently much excited. Rostov moved to the window to see whom he was
21248. speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, Topcheenko.
21249. 
21250. "I ordered you not to let them eat that Mashka woot stuff!" Denisov was
21251. shouting. "And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought some fwom
21252. the fields."
21253. 
21254. "I have given the order again and again, your honor, but they don't
21255. obey," answered the quartermaster.
21256. 
21257. Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: "Let him fuss
21258. and bustle now, my job's done and I'm lying down--capitally!" He could
21259. hear that Lavrushka--that sly, bold orderly of Denisov's--was talking,
21260. as well as the quartermaster. Lavrushka was saying something about
21261. loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for
21262. provisions.
21263. 
21264. Then Denisov's voice was heard shouting farther and farther away.
21265. "Saddle! Second platoon!"
21266. 
21267. "Where are they off to now?" thought Rostov.
21268. 
21269. Five minutes later, Denisov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots
21270. on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took
21271. his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer
21272. to Rostov's inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly
21273. that he had some business.
21274. 
21275. "Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!" said Denisov going
21276. out, and Rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the
21277. mud. He did not even trouble to find out where Denisov had gone. Having
21278. got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till
21279. toward evening. Denisov had not yet returned. The weather had cleared
21280. up, and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka,
21281. laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the
21282. soft mud. Rostov joined them. In the middle of the game, the officers
21283. saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses
21284. behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket
21285. ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.
21286. 
21287. "There now, Denisov has been worrying," said Rostov, "and here are the
21288. provisions."
21289. 
21290. "So they are!" said the officers. "Won't the soldiers be glad!"
21291. 
21292. A little behind the hussars came Denisov, accompanied by two infantry
21293. officers with whom he was talking.
21294. 
21295. Rostov went to meet them.
21296. 
21297. "I warn you, Captain," one of the officers, a short thin man, evidently
21298. very angry, was saying.
21299. 
21300. "Haven't I told you I won't give them up?" replied Denisov.
21301. 
21302. "You will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny--seizing the transport of
21303. one's own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days."
21304. 
21305. "And mine have had nothing for two weeks," said Denisov.
21306. 
21307. "It is robbery! You'll answer for it, sir!" said the infantry officer,
21308. raising his voice.
21309. 
21310. "Now, what are you pestewing me for?" cried Denisov, suddenly losing his
21311. temper. "I shall answer for it and not you, and you'd better not buzz
21312. about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!" he shouted at the officers.
21313. 
21314. "Very well, then!" shouted the little officer, undaunted and not riding
21315. away. "If you are determined to rob, I'll..."
21316. 
21317. "Go to the devil! quick ma'ch, while you're safe and sound!" and Denisov
21318. turned his horse on the officer.
21319. 
21320. "Very well, very well!" muttered the officer, threateningly, and turning
21321. his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.
21322. 
21323. "A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!" shouted Denisov
21324. after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a
21325. mounted infantryman) and riding up to Rostov, he burst out laughing.
21326. 
21327. "I've taken twansports from the infantwy by force!" he said. "After all,
21328. can't let our men starve."
21329. 
21330. The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an
21331. infantry regiment, but learning from Lavrushka that the transport
21332. was unescorted, Denisov with his hussars had seized it by force. The
21333. soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared
21334. them with the other squadrons.
21335. 
21336. The next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov, and holding his
21337. fingers spread out before his eyes said:
21338. 
21339. "This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and won't
21340. begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle
21341. the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign
21342. a receipt for such and such stores received. If not, as the demand was
21343. booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row and the affair
21344. may end badly."
21345. 
21346. From the regimental commander's, Denisov rode straight to the staff with
21347. a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came back to
21348. his dugout in a state such as Rostov had never yet seen him in. Denisov
21349. could not speak and gasped for breath. When Rostov asked what was the
21350. matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse,
21351. feeble voice.
21352. 
21353. Alarmed at Denisov's condition, Rostov suggested that he should undress,
21354. drink some water, and send for the doctor.
21355. 
21356. "Twy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but I'll
21357. always thwash scoundwels... and I'll tell the Empewo'... Ice..." he
21358. muttered.
21359. 
21360. The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary to
21361. bleed Denisov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm
21362. and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him.
21363. 
21364. "I get there," began Denisov. "'Now then, where's your chief's
21365. quarters?' They were pointed out. 'Please to wait.' 'I've widden twenty
21366. miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait. Announce me.'
21367. Vewy well, so out comes their head chief--also took it into his head to
21368. lecture me: 'It's wobbewy!'--'Wobbewy,' I say, 'is not done by man who
21369. seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to
21370. fill his own pockets!' 'Will you please be silent?' 'Vewy good!' Then he
21371. says: 'Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner, but your affair will
21372. be passed on to headquarters.' I go to the commissioner. I enter, and at
21373. the table... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it that's
21374. starving us?" shouted Denisov, hitting the table with the fist of his
21375. newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and
21376. the tumblers on it jumped about. "Telyanin! 'What? So it's you who's
21377. starving us to death! Is it? Take this and this!' and I hit him so
21378. pat, stwaight on his snout... 'Ah, what a... what a...!' and I sta'ted
21379. fwashing him... Well, I've had a bit of fun I can tell you!" cried
21380. Denisov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing under his black
21381. mustache. "I'd have killed him if they hadn't taken him away!"
21382. 
21383. "But what are you shouting for? Calm yourself," said Rostov. "You've set
21384. your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up again."
21385. 
21386. Denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm and
21387. cheerful.
21388. 
21389. But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostov's and
21390. Denisov's dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed
21391. them a paper addressed to Major Denisov from the regimental commander
21392. in which inquiries were made about yesterday's occurrence. The adjutant
21393. told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn: that a
21394. court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the severity with
21395. which marauding and insubordination were now regarded, degradation to
21396. the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.
21397. 
21398. The case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after
21399. seizing the transports, Major Denisov, being drunk, went to the chief
21400. quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief, threatened
21401. to strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the office and given
21402. two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.
21403. 
21404. In answer to Rostov's renewed questions, Denisov said, laughing, that he
21405. thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it, but
21406. that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the least fear
21407. any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he
21408. would give them an answer that they would not easily forget.
21409. 
21410. Denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rostov knew him
21411. too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart
21412. he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was
21413. evidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices
21414. from the court arrived, and on the first of May, Denisov was ordered to
21415. hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before
21416. the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat
21417. office. On the previous day Platov reconnoitered with two Cossack
21418. regiments and two squadrons of hussars. Denisov, as was his wont, rode
21419. out in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A bullet fired by
21420. a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at
21421. another time Denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a
21422. wound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing
21423. at the staff and went into hospital.
21424. 
21425. 
21426. 
21427. 
21428. 
21429. CHAPTER XVII
21430. 
21431. 
21432. In June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the Pavlograds did
21433. not take part, and after that an armistice was proclaimed. Rostov, who
21434. felt his friend's absence very much, having no news of him since he
21435. left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his
21436. affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denisov
21437. in hospital.
21438. 
21439. The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated
21440. by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so
21441. beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly
21442. dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets,
21443. tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.
21444. 
21445. The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and
21446. panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence
21447. that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged soldiers, with pale
21448. swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the
21449. yard.
21450. 
21451. Directly Rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
21452. putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army
21453. doctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.
21454. 
21455. "I can't tear myself to pieces," the doctor was saying. "Come to Makar
21456. Alexeevich in the evening. I shall be there."
21457. 
21458. The assistant asked some further questions.
21459. 
21460. "Oh, do the best you can! Isn't it all the same?" The doctor noticed
21461. Rostov coming upstairs.
21462. 
21463. "What do you want, sir?" said the doctor. "What do you want? The bullets
21464. having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a pesthouse, sir."
21465. 
21466. "How so?" asked Rostov.
21467. 
21468. "Typhus, sir. It's death to go in. Only we two, Makeev and I" (he
21469. pointed to the assistant), "keep on here. Some five of us doctors have
21470. died in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,"
21471. said the doctor with evident satisfaction. "Prussian doctors have been
21472. invited here, but our allies don't like it at all."
21473. 
21474. Rostov explained that he wanted to see Major Denisov of the hussars, who
21475. was wounded.
21476. 
21477. "I don't know. I can't tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in charge
21478. of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! It's well that
21479. the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some
21480. lint each month or we should be lost!" he laughed. "Four hundred, sir,
21481. and they're always sending me fresh ones. There are four hundred? Eh?"
21482. he asked, turning to the assistant.
21483. 
21484. The assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and impatient
21485. for the talkative doctor to go.
21486. 
21487. "Major Denisov," Rostov said again. "He was wounded at Molliten."
21488. 
21489. "Dead, I fancy. Eh, Makeev?" queried the doctor, in a tone of
21490. indifference.
21491. 
21492. The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor's words.
21493. 
21494. "Is he tall and with reddish hair?" asked the doctor.
21495. 
21496. Rostov described Denisov's appearance.
21497. 
21498. "There was one like that," said the doctor, as if pleased. "That one is
21499. dead, I fancy. However, I'll look up our list. We had a list. Have you
21500. got it, Makeev?"
21501. 
21502. "Makar Alexeevich has the list," answered the assistant. "But if you'll
21503. step into the officers' wards you'll see for yourself," he added,
21504. turning to Rostov.
21505. 
21506. "Ah, you'd better not go, sir," said the doctor, "or you may have to
21507. stay here yourself."
21508. 
21509. But Rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to
21510. show him the way.
21511. 
21512. "Only don't blame me!" the doctor shouted up after him.
21513. 
21514. Rostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell was so
21515. strong there that Rostov held his nose and had to pause and collect
21516. his strength before he could go on. A door opened to the right, and an
21517. emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in underclothing, limped
21518. out and, leaning against the doorpost, looked with glittering envious
21519. eyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at the door, Rostov saw that
21520. the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats.
21521. 
21522. "May I go in and look?"
21523. 
21524. "What is there to see?" said the assistant.
21525. 
21526. But, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in,
21527. Rostov entered the soldiers' ward. The foul air, to which he had already
21528. begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It was a
21529. little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where it
21530. originated.
21531. 
21532. In the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows,
21533. the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and
21534. leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were unconscious and
21535. paid no attention to the newcomers. Those who were conscious raised
21536. themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at
21537. Rostov with the same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and envy
21538. of another's health. Rostov went to the middle of the room and looking
21539. through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing
21540. there. He stood still, looking silently around. He had not at all
21541. expected such a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the
21542. passage on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge
21543. by the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs
21544. outstretched. His face was purple, his eyes were rolled back so that
21545. only the whites were seen, and on his bare legs and arms which were
21546. still red, the veins stood out like cords. He was knocking the back of
21547. his head against the floor, hoarsely uttering some word which he kept
21548. repeating. Rostov listened and made out the word. It was "drink, drink,
21549. a drink!" Rostov glanced round, looking for someone who would put this
21550. man back in his place and bring him water.
21551. 
21552. "Who looks after the sick here?" he asked the assistant.
21553. 
21554. Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from the
21555. next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of Rostov.
21556. 
21557. "Good day, your honor!" he shouted, rolling his eyes at Rostov and
21558. evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.
21559. 
21560. "Get him to his place and give him some water," said Rostov, pointing to
21561. the Cossack.
21562. 
21563. "Yes, your honor," the soldier replied complacently, and rolling his
21564. eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not
21565. move.
21566. 
21567. "No, it's impossible to do anything here," thought Rostov, lowering his
21568. eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense look fixed
21569. on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on an overcoat,
21570. sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton, with a
21571. stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostov. The man's neighbor
21572. on one side whispered something to him, pointing at Rostov, who noticed
21573. that the old man wanted to speak to him. He drew nearer and saw that the
21574. old man had only one leg bent under him, the other had been amputated
21575. above the knee. His neighbor on the other side, who lay motionless some
21576. distance from him with his head thrown back, was a young soldier with
21577. a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were
21578. rolled back. Rostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran
21579. down his back.
21580. 
21581. "Why, this one seems..." he began, turning to the assistant.
21582. 
21583. "And how we've been begging, your honor," said the old soldier, his
21584. jaw quivering. "He's been dead since morning. After all we're men, not
21585. dogs."
21586. 
21587. "I'll send someone at once. He shall be taken away--taken away at once,"
21588. said the assistant hurriedly. "Let us go, your honor."
21589. 
21590. "Yes, yes, let us go," said Rostov hastily, and lowering his eyes and
21591. shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful
21592. envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the room.
21593. 
21594. 
21595. 
21596. 
21597. 
21598. CHAPTER XVIII
21599. 
21600. 
21601. Going along the corridor, the assistant led Rostov to the officers'
21602. wards, consisting of three rooms, the doors of which stood open. There
21603. were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or
21604. sitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing
21605. gowns. The first person Rostov met in the officers' ward was a thin
21606. little man with one arm, who was walking about the first room in a
21607. nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth.
21608. Rostov looked at him, trying to remember where he had seen him before.
21609. 
21610. "See where we've met again!" said the little man. "Tushin, Tushin, don't
21611. you remember, who gave you a lift at Schon Grabern? And I've had a bit
21612. cut off, you see..." he went on with a smile, pointing to the empty
21613. sleeve of his dressing gown. "Looking for Vasili Dmitrich Denisov? My
21614. neighbor," he added, when he heard who Rostov wanted. "Here, here," and
21615. Tushin led him into the next room, from whence came sounds of several
21616. laughing voices.
21617. 
21618. "How can they laugh, or even live at all here?" thought Rostov, still
21619. aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in
21620. the soldiers' ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious
21621. looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face of that
21622. young soldier with eyes rolled back.
21623. 
21624. Denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket, though it
21625. was nearly noon.
21626. 
21627. "Ah, Wostov? How are you, how are you?" he called out, still in the
21628. same voice as in the regiment, but Rostov noticed sadly that under this
21629. habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed
21630. itself in the expression of Denisov's face and the intonations of his
21631. voice.
21632. 
21633. His wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six weeks
21634. after he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces
21635. of the other hospital patients, but it was not this that struck Rostov.
21636. What struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to see him, and
21637. smiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the regiment, nor about
21638. the general state of affairs, and when Rostov spoke of these matters did
21639. not listen.
21640. 
21641. Rostov even noticed that Denisov did not like to be reminded of the
21642. regiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on
21643. outside the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and
21644. was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On
21645. Rostov's inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from
21646. under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the
21647. rough draft of his answer to it. He became animated when he began
21648. reading his paper and specially drew Rostov's attention to the stinging
21649. rejoinders he made to his enemies. His hospital companions, who had
21650. gathered round Rostov--a fresh arrival from the world outside--gradually
21651. began to disperse as soon as Denisov began reading his answer. Rostov
21652. noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that
21653. story more than once and were tired of it. Only the man who had the next
21654. bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed, gloomily frowning and
21655. smoking a pipe, and little one-armed Tushin still listened, shaking his
21656. head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading, the Uhlan interrupted
21657. Denisov.
21658. 
21659. "But what I say is," he said, turning to Rostov, "it would be best
21660. simply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards will
21661. now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted...."
21662. 
21663. "Me petition the Empewo'!" exclaimed Denisov, in a voice to which he
21664. tried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like an
21665. expression of irritable impotence. "What for? If I were a wobber I would
21666. ask mercy, but I'm being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers to book.
21667. Let them twy me, I'm not afwaid of anyone. I've served the Tsar and
21668. my countwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I to be degwaded?...
21669. Listen, I'm w'iting to them stwaight. This is what I say: 'If I had
21670. wobbed the Tweasuwy...'"
21671. 
21672. "It's certainly well written," said Tushin, "but that's not the point,
21673. Vasili Dmitrich," and he also turned to Rostov. "One has to submit, and
21674. Vasili Dmitrich doesn't want to. You know the auditor told you it was a
21675. bad business."
21676. 
21677. "Well, let it be bad," said Denisov.
21678. 
21679. "The auditor wrote out a petition for you," continued Tushin, "and
21680. you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt he"
21681. (indicating Rostov) "has connections on the staff. You won't find a
21682. better opportunity."
21683. 
21684. "Haven't I said I'm not going to gwovel?" Denisov interrupted him, went
21685. on reading his paper.
21686. 
21687. Rostov had not the courage to persuade Denisov, though he instinctively
21688. felt that the way advised by Tushin and the other officers was the
21689. safest, and though he would have been glad to be of service to Denisov.
21690. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper.
21691. 
21692. When the reading of Denisov's virulent reply, which took more than an
21693. hour, was over, Rostov said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day in
21694. a most dejected state of mind amid Denisov's hospital comrades, who had
21695. gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to their
21696. stories. Denisov was moodily silent all the evening.
21697. 
21698. Late in the evening, when Rostov was about to leave, he asked Denisov
21699. whether he had no commission for him.
21700. 
21701. "Yes, wait a bit," said Denisov, glancing round at the officers, and
21702. taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where he
21703. had an inkpot, and sat down to write.
21704. 
21705. "It seems it's no use knocking one's head against a wall!" he said,
21706. coming from the window and giving Rostov a large envelope. In it was
21707. the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in which Denisov,
21708. without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials, simply
21709. asked for pardon.
21710. 
21711. "Hand it in. It seems..."
21712. 
21713. He did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile.
21714. 
21715. 
21716. 
21717. 
21718. 
21719. CHAPTER XIX
21720. 
21721. 
21722. Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of
21723. Denisov's affairs, Rostov rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor.
21724. 
21725. On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in
21726. Tilsit. Boris Drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom he
21727. was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at
21728. Tilsit.
21729. 
21730. "I should like to see the great man," he said, alluding to Napoleon,
21731. whom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.
21732. 
21733. "You are speaking of Buonaparte?" asked the general, smiling.
21734. 
21735. Boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was
21736. being tested.
21737. 
21738. "I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon," he replied. The
21739. general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.
21740. 
21741. "You will go far," he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.
21742. 
21743. Boris was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two
21744. Emperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon
21745. pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the
21746. pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern
21747. on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon's arrival, saw both Emperors
21748. get into boats, and saw how Napoleon--reaching the raft first--stepped
21749. quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand to him, and how
21750. they both retired into the pavilion. Since he had begun to move in the
21751. highest circles Boris had made it his habit to watch attentively all
21752. that went on around him and to note it down. At the time of the meeting
21753. at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with Napoleon and
21754. about the uniforms they wore, and listened attentively to words spoken
21755. by important personages. At the moment the Emperors went into the
21756. pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not forget to look at it
21757. again when Alexander came out. The interview had lasted an hour and
21758. fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same evening, among other
21759. facts he felt to be of historic importance. As the Emperor's suite was
21760. a very small one, it was a matter of great importance, for a man who
21761. valued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit on the occasion of
21762. this interview between the two Emperors, and having succeeded in this,
21763. Boris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured. He had not
21764. only become known, but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted
21765. him. Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so
21766. that the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from
21767. cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer,
21768. would now have been surprised had he been absent.
21769. 
21770. Boris lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhilinski.
21771. Zhilinski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately
21772. fond of the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French
21773. officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and
21774. lunching with him and Boris.
21775. 
21776. On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilinski arranged a
21777. supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of
21778. Napoleon's, there were also several French officers of the Guard, and
21779. a page of Napoleon's, a young lad of an old aristocratic French
21780. family. That same day, Rostov, profiting by the darkness to avoid being
21781. recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging
21782. occupied by Boris and Zhilinski.
21783. 
21784. Rostov, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far
21785. from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the
21786. French--who from being foes had suddenly become friends--that had taken
21787. place at headquarters and in Boris. In the army, Bonaparte and the
21788. French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt,
21789. and fear. Only recently, talking with one of Platov's Cossack officers,
21790. Rostov had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he would be
21791. treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately, happening
21792. to meet a wounded French colonel on the road, Rostov had maintained with
21793. heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the
21794. criminal Bonaparte. Rostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the
21795. presence of French officers in Boris' lodging, dressed in uniforms he
21796. had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from
21797. the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a French officer, who
21798. thrust his head out of the door, that warlike feeling of hostility which
21799. he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him. He
21800. stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetskoy lived
21801. there. Boris, hearing a strange voice in the anteroom, came out to meet
21802. him. An expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face
21803. on first recognizing Rostov.
21804. 
21805. "Ah, it's you? Very glad, very glad to see you," he said, however,
21806. coming toward him with a smile. But Rostov had noticed his first
21807. impulse.
21808. 
21809. "I've come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have
21810. business," he said coldly.
21811. 
21812. "No, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment. Dans
21813. un moment je suis a vous," * he said, answering someone who called him.
21814. 
21815. 
21816.     * "In a minute I shall be at your disposal."
21817. 
21818. 
21819. "I see I'm intruding," Rostov repeated.
21820. 
21821. The look of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris' face: having
21822. evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly took
21823. both Rostov's hands and led him into the next room. His eyes, looking
21824. serenely and steadily at Rostov, seemed to be veiled by something, as if
21825. screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to Rostov.
21826. 
21827. "Oh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!" said Boris, and he
21828. led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced
21829. him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but an hussar
21830. officer, and an old friend of his.
21831. 
21832. "Count Zhilinski--le Comte N. N.--le Capitaine S. S.," said he,
21833. naming his guests. Rostov looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed
21834. reluctantly, and remained silent.
21835. 
21836. Zhilinski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very
21837. willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostov. Boris did not
21838. appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same
21839. pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he
21840. had met Rostov, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the Frenchmen,
21841. with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen, addressed the
21842. obstinately taciturn Rostov, saying that the latter had probably come to
21843. Tilsit to see the Emperor.
21844. 
21845. "No, I came on business," replied Rostov, briefly.
21846. 
21847. Rostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of
21848. dissatisfaction on Boris' face, and as always happens to those in a bad
21849. humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and
21850. that he was in everybody's way. He really was in their way, for he alone
21851. took no part in the conversation which again became general. The looks
21852. the visitors cast on him seemed to say: "And what is he sitting here
21853. for?" He rose and went up to Boris.
21854. 
21855. "Anyhow, I'm in your way," he said in a low tone. "Come and talk over my
21856. business and I'll go away."
21857. 
21858. "Oh, no, not at all," said Boris. "But if you are tired, come and lie
21859. down in my room and have a rest."
21860. 
21861. "Yes, really..."
21862. 
21863. They went into the little room where Boris slept. Rostov, without
21864. sitting down, began at once, irritably (as if Boris were to blame
21865. in some way) telling him about Denisov's affair, asking him whether,
21866. through his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor on
21867. Denisov's behalf and get Denisov's petition handed in. When he and Boris
21868. were alone, Rostov felt for the first time that he could not look Boris
21869. in the face without a sense of awkwardness. Boris, with one leg crossed
21870. over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of
21871. his right, listened to Rostov as a general listens to the report of a
21872. subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight into Rostov's
21873. eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this happened Rostov felt
21874. uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.
21875. 
21876. "I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe
21877. in such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the
21878. Emperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general,
21879. I think..."
21880. 
21881. "So you don't want to do anything? Well then, say so!" Rostov almost
21882. shouted, not looking Boris in the face.
21883. 
21884. Boris smiled.
21885. 
21886. "On the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought..."
21887. 
21888. At that moment Zhilinski's voice was heard calling Boris.
21889. 
21890. "Well then, go, go, go..." said Rostov, and refusing supper and
21891. remaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long
21892. time, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.
21893. 
21894. 
21895. 
21896. 
21897. 
21898. CHAPTER XX
21899. 
21900. 
21901. Rostov had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on
21902. Denisov's behalf. He could not himself go to the general in attendance
21903. as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do
21904. so, and Boris, even had he wished to, could not have done so on the
21905. following day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were
21906. signed. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross
21907. of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the
21908. First Degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening, given by
21909. a battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazhensk battalion. The
21910. Emperors were to be present at that banquet.
21911. 
21912. Rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Boris that, when the
21913. latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next
21914. morning went away, avoiding Boris. In his civilian clothes and a
21915. round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the French and their
21916. uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French
21917. Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables being set up and
21918. preparations made for the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors
21919. draped from side to side of the streets, with huge monograms A and N. In
21920. the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed.
21921. 
21922. "Boris doesn't want to help me and I don't want to ask him. That's
21923. settled," thought Nicholas. "All is over between us, but I won't leave
21924. here without having done all I can for Denisov and certainly not without
21925. getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!... He is here!" thought
21926. Rostov, who had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander
21927. lodged.
21928. 
21929. Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were
21930. assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.
21931. 
21932. "I may see him at any moment," thought Rostov. "If only I were to hand
21933. the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really arrest me
21934. for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on whose side
21935. justice lies. He understands everything, knows everything. Who can be
21936. more just, more magnanimous than he? And even if they did arrest me for
21937. being here, what would it matter?" thought he, looking at an officer who
21938. was entering the house the Emperor occupied. "After all, people do go
21939. in.... It's all nonsense! I'll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor
21940. myself so much the worse for Drubetskoy who drives me to it!" And
21941. suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect, Rostov felt for
21942. the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house.
21943. 
21944. "No, I won't miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz," he
21945. thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of
21946. the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. "I will fall at his
21947. feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even
21948. thank me. 'I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is the
21949. greatest happiness,'" Rostov fancied the sovereign saying. And passing
21950. people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch of the
21951. Emperor's house.
21952. 
21953. A broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he
21954. saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the
21955. lower floor.
21956. 
21957. "Whom do you want?" someone inquired.
21958. 
21959. "To hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty," said Nicholas, with a
21960. tremor in his voice.
21961. 
21962. "A petition? This way, to the officer on duty" (he was shown the door
21963. leading downstairs), "only it won't be accepted."
21964. 
21965. On hearing this indifferent voice, Rostov grew frightened at what he
21966. was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so
21967. fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away,
21968. but the official who had questioned him opened the door, and Rostov
21969. entered.
21970. 
21971. A short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and
21972. a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that
21973. room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a
21974. new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason,
21975. attracted Rostov's attention. This man was speaking to someone in the
21976. adjoining room.
21977. 
21978. "A good figure and in her first bloom," he was saying, but on seeing
21979. Rostov, he stopped short and frowned.
21980. 
21981. "What is it? A petition?"
21982. 
21983. "What is it?" asked the person in the other room.
21984. 
21985. "Another petitioner," answered the man with the braces.
21986. 
21987. "Tell him to come later. He'll be coming out directly, we must go."
21988. 
21989. "Later... later! Tomorrow. It's too late..."
21990. 
21991. Rostov turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped
21992. him.
21993. 
21994. "Whom have you come from? Who are you?"
21995. 
21996. "I come from Major Denisov," answered Rostov.
21997. 
21998. "Are you an officer?"
21999. 
22000. "Lieutenant Count Rostov."
22001. 
22002. "What audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with
22003. you... go," and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him.
22004. 
22005. Rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were
22006. many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.
22007. 
22008. Cursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding
22009. himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to
22010. shame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety
22011. of his conduct and repenting of it, Rostov, with downcast eyes, was
22012. making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a
22013. familiar voice called him and a hand detained him.
22014. 
22015. "What are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?" asked a deep voice.
22016. 
22017. It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor's special favor
22018. during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in
22019. which Rostov was serving.
22020. 
22021. Rostov, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly,
22022. jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice
22023. told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for Denisov, whom the
22024. general knew. Having heard Rostov to the end, the general shook his head
22025. gravely.
22026. 
22027. "I'm sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter."
22028. 
22029. Hardly had Rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining
22030. Denisov's case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard
22031. on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The
22032. gentlemen of the Emperor's suite ran down the stairs and went to their
22033. horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the
22034. Emperor's horse, and the faint creak of a footstep Rostov knew at once
22035. was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the danger of being recognized,
22036. Rostov went close to the porch, together with some inquisitive
22037. civilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he adored:
22038. that same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and
22039. mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign
22040. rose again in Rostov's soul in all its old force. In the uniform of
22041. the Preobrazhensk regiment--white chamois-leather breeches and high
22042. boots--and wearing a star Rostov did not know (it was that of the Legion
22043. d'honneur), the monarch came out into the porch, putting on his gloves
22044. and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked about him,
22045. brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few words to
22046. some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander of Rostov's
22047. division, smiled and beckoned to him.
22048. 
22049. All the suite drew back and Rostov saw the general talking for some time
22050. to the Emperor.
22051. 
22052. The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse.
22053. Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom
22054. was Rostov) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse, with
22055. his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and
22056. said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:
22057. 
22058. "I cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than I,"
22059. and he raised his foot to the stirrup.
22060. 
22061. The general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and
22062. rode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm, Rostov
22063. ran after him with the crowd.
22064. 
22065. 
22066. 
22067. 
22068. 
22069. CHAPTER XXI
22070. 
22071. 
22072. The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion
22073. of the Preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the
22074. French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.
22075. 
22076. As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented
22077. arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and
22078. at the head of them Rostov recognized Napoleon. It could be no one else.
22079. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over a
22080. white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding
22081. a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered
22082. saddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did
22083. so, Rostov, with his cavalryman's eye, could not help noticing that
22084. Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions
22085. shouted "Hurrah!" and "Vive l'Empereur!" Napoleon said something to
22086. Alexander, and both Emperors dismounted and took each other's hands.
22087. Napoleon's face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile. Alexander was
22088. saying something affable to him.
22089. 
22090. In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes' horses, which were
22091. pushing back the crowd, Rostov kept his eyes on every movement of
22092. Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander
22093. treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with
22094. the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter
22095. to him.
22096. 
22097. Alexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, approached
22098. the right flank of the Preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to
22099. the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close
22100. to the Emperors that Rostov, standing in the front row, was afraid he
22101. might be recognized.
22102. 
22103. "Sire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the
22104. bravest of your soldiers," said a sharp, precise voice, articulating
22105. every letter.
22106. 
22107. This was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into
22108. Alexander's eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him
22109. and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.
22110. 
22111. "To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war," added
22112. Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance
22113. exasperating to Rostov, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn
22114. up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their
22115. Emperor.
22116. 
22117. "Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?" said Alexander and
22118. took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozlovski, the commander of the
22119. battalion.
22120. 
22121. Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand,
22122. tore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him
22123. rushed forward and picked it up.
22124. 
22125. "To whom shall it be given?" the Emperor Alexander asked Koslovski, in
22126. Russian in a low voice.
22127. 
22128. "To whomever Your Majesty commands."
22129. 
22130. The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back,
22131. remarked:
22132. 
22133. "But we must give him an answer."
22134. 
22135. Kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostov in his
22136. scrutiny.
22137. 
22138. "Can it be me?" thought Rostov.
22139. 
22140. "Lazarev!" the colonel called, with a frown, and Lazarev, the first
22141. soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.
22142. 
22143. "Where are you off to? Stop here!" voices whispered to Lazarev who did
22144. not know where to go. Lazarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at his
22145. colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers called
22146. before the ranks.
22147. 
22148. Napoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out
22149. behind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing
22150. at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed
22151. something from one to another, and a page--the same one Rostov had seen
22152. the previous evening at Boris'--ran forward and, bowing respectfully
22153. over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment, laid
22154. in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without looking, pressed two
22155. fingers together and the badge was between them. Then he approached
22156. Lazarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch),
22157. looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now
22158. doing was done for the sake of his ally, and the small white hand
22159. holding the Order touched one of Lazarev's buttons. It was as if
22160. Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch
22161. that soldier's breast for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded, and
22162. distinguished from everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely laid
22163. the cross on Lazarev's breast and, dropping his hand, turned toward
22164. Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there. And it
22165. really did.
22166. 
22167. Officious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross and
22168. fastened it to the uniform. Lazarev glanced morosely at the little man
22169. with white hands who was doing something to him and, still standing
22170. motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into Alexander's eyes,
22171. as if asking whether he should stand there, or go away, or do something
22172. else. But receiving no orders, he remained for some time in that rigid
22173. position.
22174. 
22175. The Emperors remounted and rode away. The Preobrazhensk battalion,
22176. breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables
22177. prepared for them.
22178. 
22179. Lazarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced
22180. him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and
22181. civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French
22182. voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square.
22183. Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by
22184. Rostov.
22185. 
22186. "What d'you think of the treat? All on silver plate," one of them was
22187. saying. "Have you seen Lazarev?"
22188. 
22189. "I have."
22190. 
22191. "Tomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner."
22192. 
22193. "Yes, but what luck for Lazarev! Twelve hundred francs' pension for
22194. life."
22195. 
22196. "Here's a cap, lads!" shouted a Preobrazhensk soldier, donning a shaggy
22197. French cap.
22198. 
22199. "It's a fine thing! First-rate!"
22200. 
22201. "Have you heard the password?" asked one Guards' officer of another.
22202. "The day before yesterday it was 'Napoleon, France, bravoure';
22203. yesterday, 'Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.' One day our Emperor gives it
22204. and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St. George's
22205. Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be done. He must
22206. respond in kind."
22207. 
22208. Boris, too, with his friend Zhilinski, came to see the Preobrazhensk
22209. banquet. On his way back, he noticed Rostov standing by the corner of a
22210. house.
22211. 
22212. "Rostov! How d'you do? We missed one another," he said, and could
22213. not refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and
22214. troubled was Rostov's face.
22215. 
22216. "Nothing, nothing," replied Rostov.
22217. 
22218. "You'll call round?"
22219. 
22220. "Yes, I will."
22221. 
22222. Rostov stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from a
22223. distance. In his mind, a painful process was going on which he could
22224. not bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in his soul. Now he
22225. remembered Denisov with his changed expression, his submission, and the
22226. whole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So
22227. vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he
22228. looked round to see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that
22229. self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an
22230. Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then why those severed
22231. arms and legs and those dead men?... Then again he thought of Lazarev
22232. rewarded and Denisov punished and unpardoned. He caught himself
22233. harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.
22234. 
22235. The smell of the food the Preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of
22236. hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to
22237. eat before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.
22238. There he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself,
22239. had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a
22240. dinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation
22241. naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of
22242. the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of
22243. Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would
22244. have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition.
22245. Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a
22246. couple of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind went on
22247. tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to
22248. his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the
22249. officers' saying that it was humiliating to look at the French, Rostov
22250. began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the
22251. surprise of the officers:
22252. 
22253. "How can you judge what's best?" he cried, the blood suddenly rushing to
22254. his face. "How can you judge the Emperor's actions? What right have
22255. we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor's aims or his
22256. actions!"
22257. 
22258. "But I never said a word about the Emperor!" said the officer,
22259. justifying himself, and unable to understand Rostov's outburst, except
22260. on the supposition that he was drunk.
22261. 
22262. But Rostov did not listen to him.
22263. 
22264. "We are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more," he
22265. went on. "If we are ordered to die, we must die. If we're punished, it
22266. means that we have deserved it, it's not for us to judge. If the Emperor
22267. pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance
22268. with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If once we begin
22269. judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred will be left! That
22270. way we shall be saying there is no God--nothing!" shouted Nicholas,
22271. banging the table--very little to the point as it seemed to his
22272. listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts.
22273. 
22274. "Our business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That's
22275. all...." said he.
22276. 
22277. "And to drink," said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.
22278. 
22279. "Yes, and to drink," assented Nicholas. "Hullo there! Another bottle!"
22280. he shouted.
22281. 
22282. In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with
22283. the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was
22284. much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.
22285.

22290. CHAPTER XXII
22291. 
22292. 
22293. In 1809 the intimacy between "the world's two arbiters," as Napoleon
22294. and Alexander were called, was such that when Napoleon declared war on
22295. Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with our
22296. old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria, and in
22297. court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one of
22298. Alexander's sisters was spoken of. But besides considerations of
22299. foreign policy, the attention of Russian society was at that time keenly
22300. directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the
22301. departments of government.
22302. 
22303. Life meanwhile--real life, with its essential interests of health and
22304. sickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in thought,
22305. science, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and passions--went on
22306. as usual, independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity
22307. with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction.

22319. CHAPTER I
22320. 
22321. 
22322. Prince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country.
22323. 
22324. All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estates--and constantly
22325. changing from one thing to another had never accomplished--were carried
22326. out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty.
22327. 
22328. He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked,
22329. and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going.
22330. 
22331. On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became
22332. free agricultural laborers--this being one of the first examples of
22333. the kind in Russia. On other estates the serfs' compulsory labor was
22334. commuted for a quitrent. A trained midwife was engaged for Bogucharovo
22335. at his expense, and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to
22336. the children of the peasants and household serfs.
22337. 
22338. Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his
22339. son, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half he spent in
22340. "Bogucharovo Cloister," as his father called Prince Andrew's estate.
22341. Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed
22342. to Pierre, he diligently followed all that went on, received many books,
22343. and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors
22344. from Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these people lagged behind
22345. himself--who never left the country--in knowledge of what was happening
22346. in home and foreign affairs.
22347. 
22348. Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of
22349. books, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of
22350. our last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a
22351. reform of the army rules and regulations.
22352. 
22353. In the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryazan estates which had been
22354. inherited by his son, whose guardian he was.
22355. 
22356. Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new
22357. grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of white
22358. spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky. He was not thinking of
22359. anything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side.
22360. 
22361. They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before.
22362. They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and green
22363. fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge,
22364. uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips of
22365. stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there, and into a
22366. birch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the forest it was
22367. almost hot, no wind could be felt. The birches with their sticky green
22368. leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades
22369. of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year's leaves. The
22370. coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there
22371. among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter. On entering the
22372. forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly.
22373. 
22374. Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter assented.
22375. But apparently the coachman's sympathy was not enough for Peter, and he
22376. turned on the box toward his master.
22377. 
22378. "How pleasant it is, your excellency!" he said with a respectful smile.
22379. 
22380. "What?"
22381. 
22382. "It's pleasant, your excellency!"
22383. 
22384. "What is he talking about?" thought Prince Andrew. "Oh, the spring,
22385. I suppose," he thought as he turned round. "Yes, really everything is
22386. green already.... How early! The birches and cherry and alders too are
22387. coming out.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is one oak!"
22388. 
22389.  At the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of
22390. the birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice
22391. as tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a
22392. man could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had been
22393. broken off and its bark scarred. With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling
22394. unsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged,
22395. stern, and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the
22396. dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak,
22397. refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or
22398. the sunshine.
22399. 
22400. "Spring, love, happiness!" this oak seemed to say. "Are you not weary of
22401. that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the same and
22402. always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look at those
22403. cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too, sticking out my broken
22404. and barked fingers just where they have grown, whether from my back or
22405. my sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in your
22406. hopes and your lies."
22407. 
22408. As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to
22409. look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak,
22410. too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid,
22411. misshapen, and grim as ever.
22412. 
22413. "Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right," thought Prince Andrew.
22414. "Let others--the young--yield afresh to that fraud, but we know life,
22415. our life is finished!"
22416. 
22417. A whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully pleasant, rose
22418. in his soul in connection with that tree. During this journey he, as
22419. it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion,
22420. restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything
22421. anew--but that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and not
22422. disturbing himself or desiring anything.
22423. 
22424. 
22425. 
22426. 
22427. 
22428. CHAPTER II
22429. 
22430. 
22431. Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district
22432. in connection with the affairs of the Ryazan estate of which he was
22433. trustee. This Marshal was Count Ilya Rostov, and in the middle of May
22434. Prince Andrew went to visit him.
22435. 
22436. It was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already clothed in
22437. green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to
22438. bathe.
22439. 
22440. Prince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about which
22441. he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the grounds
22442. of the Rostovs' house at Otradnoe. He heard merry girlish cries behind
22443. some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross
22444. the path of his caleche. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a
22445. dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with
22446. a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair
22447. escaped. The girl was shouting something but, seeing that he was a
22448. stranger, ran back laughing without looking at him.
22449. 
22450. Suddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so beautiful,
22451. the sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim pretty girl
22452. did not know, or wish to know, of his existence and was contented and
22453. cheerful in her own separate--probably foolish--but bright and happy
22454. life. "What is she so glad about? What is she thinking of? Not of
22455. the military regulations or of the arrangement of the Ryazan serfs'
22456. quitrents. Of what is she thinking? Why is she so happy?" Prince Andrew
22457. asked himself with instinctive curiosity.
22458. 
22459. In 1809 Count Ilya Rostov was living at Otradnoe just as he had done
22460. in former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province with
22461. hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince
22462. Andrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying
22463. the night.
22464. 
22465. During the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by his
22466. elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old count's
22467. house was crowded on account of an approaching name day), Prince Andrew
22468. repeatedly glanced at Natasha, gay and laughing among the younger
22469. members of the company, and asked himself each time, "What is she
22470. thinking about? Why is she so glad?"
22471. 
22472. That night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to sleep. He
22473. read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot in the
22474. room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the
22475. stupid old man (as he called Rostov), who had made him stay by assuring
22476. him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he
22477. was vexed with himself for having stayed.
22478. 
22479. He got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the
22480. shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst
22481. into the room. He opened the casement. The night was fresh, bright, and
22482. very still. Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking
22483. black on one side and with a silvery light on the other. Beneath the
22484. trees grewsome kind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver-lit
22485. leaves and stems here and there. Farther back beyond the dark trees a
22486. roof glittered with dew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly
22487. white trunk and branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly at its
22488. full, in a pale, almost starless, spring sky. Prince Andrew leaned his
22489. elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky.
22490. 
22491. His room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above were also
22492. awake. He heard female voices overhead.
22493. 
22494. "Just once more," said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew
22495. recognized at once.
22496. 
22497. "But when are you coming to bed?" replied another voice.
22498. 
22499. "I won't, I can't sleep, what's the use? Come now for the last time."
22500. 
22501.  Two girlish voices sang a musical passage--the end of some song.
22502. 
22503. "Oh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there's an end of it."
22504. 
22505. "You go to sleep, but I can't," said the first voice, coming nearer to
22506. the window. She was evidently leaning right out, for the rustle of her
22507. dress and even her breathing could be heard. Everything was stone-still,
22508. like the moon and its light and the shadows. Prince Andrew, too, dared
22509. not stir, for fear of betraying his unintentional presence.
22510. 
22511. "Sonya! Sonya!" he again heard the first speaker. "Oh, how can you
22512. sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up,
22513. Sonya!" she said almost with tears in her voice. "There never, never was
22514. such a lovely night before!"
22515. 
22516. Sonya made some reluctant reply.
22517. 
22518. "Do just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come here....
22519. Darling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like sitting down
22520. on my heels, putting my arms round my knees like this, straining tight,
22521. as tight as possible, and flying away! Like this...."
22522. 
22523. "Take care, you'll fall out."
22524. 
22525. He heard the sound of a scuffle and Sonya's disapproving voice: "It's
22526. past one o'clock."
22527. 
22528. "Oh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!"
22529. 
22530. Again all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting
22531. there. From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.
22532. 
22533. "O God, O God! What does it mean?" she suddenly exclaimed. "To bed then,
22534. if it must be!" and she slammed the casement.
22535. 
22536. "For her I might as well not exist!" thought Prince Andrew while he
22537. listened to her voice, for some reason expecting yet fearing that she
22538. might say something about him. "There she is again! As if it were on
22539. purpose," thought he.
22540. 
22541. In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful
22542. thoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his life, that unable
22543. to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once.
22544. 
22545. 
22546. 
22547. 
22548. 
22549. CHAPTER III
22550. 
22551. 
22552. Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not
22553. waiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.
22554. 
22555. It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove
22556. into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and
22557. memorable an impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded
22558. yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was
22559. thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest
22560. did not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood
22561. around, were delicately green with fluffy young shoots.
22562. 
22563. The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only
22564. a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road
22565. and the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in the shade,
22566. the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely
22567. swayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales
22568. trilled, and their voices reverberated now near, now far away.
22569. 
22570. "Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed," thought
22571. Prince Andrew. "But where is it?" he again wondered, gazing at the left
22572. side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with admiration
22573. at the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured, spreading
22574. out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and slightly
22575. trembling in the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled fingers nor
22576. old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now.
22577. Through the hard century-old bark, even where there were no twigs,
22578. leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran
22579. could have produced.
22580. 
22581. "Yes, it is the same oak," thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he was
22582. seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal. All the
22583. best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory. Austerlitz with
22584. the lofty heavens, his wife's dead reproachful face, Pierre at the
22585. ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that night
22586. itself and the moon, and.... all this rushed suddenly to his mind.
22587. 
22588. "No, life is not over at thirty-one!" Prince Andrew suddenly decided
22589. finally and decisively. "It is not enough for me to know what I have in
22590. me--everyone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to
22591. fly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not be
22592. lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it, but so that
22593. it may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!"
22594. 
22595. 
22596. On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn
22597. and found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole series of
22598. sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him
22599. to go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept springing
22600. up in his mind. He could not now understand how he could ever even have
22601. doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life, just as a month
22602. before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country
22603. could ever enter his head. It now seemed clear to him that all his
22604. experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to
22605. some kind of work and again played an active part in life. He did not
22606. even remember how formerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical
22607. arguments, it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if
22608. he now, after the lessons he had had in life, allowed himself to believe
22609. in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness
22610. or love. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. After that journey
22611. to Ryazan he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer
22612. interested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up,
22613. went to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then he would
22614. turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled a la
22615. grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame. She
22616. did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked simply,
22617. merrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his
22618. arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as
22619. he reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a
22620. crime, which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with
22621. fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and woman's beauty and love.
22622. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly
22623. cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.
22624. 
22625. "My dear," Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say, "little
22626. Nicholas can't go out today, it's very cold."
22627. 
22628. "If it were hot," Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly
22629. to his sister, "he could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he must
22630. wear warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose. That is what
22631. follows from the fact that it is cold; and not that a child who needs
22632. fresh air should remain at home," he would add with extreme logic, as
22633. if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred
22634. within him.
22635. 
22636. At such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries
22637. men up.
22638. 
22639. 
22640. 
22641. 
22642. 
22643. CHAPTER IV
22644. 
22645. 
22646. Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was the time
22647. when the youthful Speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his
22648. reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That same
22649. August the Emperor was thrown from his caleche, injured his leg, and
22650. remained three weeks at Peterhof, receiving Speranski every day and no
22651. one else. At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that
22652. so agitated society--abolishing court ranks and introducing
22653. examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and State
22654. Councilor--and not merely these but a whole state constitution,
22655. intended to change the existing order of government in Russia: legal,
22656. administrative, and financial, from the Council of State down to the
22657. district tribunals. Now those vague liberal dreams with which the
22658. Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he had tried to put
22659. into effect with the aid of his associates, Czartoryski, Novosiltsev,
22660. Kochubey, and Strogonov--whom he himself in jest had called his Comite
22661. de salut public--were taking shape and being realized.
22662. 
22663. Now all these men were replaced by Speranski on the civil side, and
22664. Arakcheev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as a
22665. gentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a levee. The
22666. Emperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with a single word.
22667. It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic
22668. to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality
22669. generally, and in the cold, repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he
22670. now found further confirmation of this surmise. The courtiers explained
22671. the Emperor's neglect of him by His Majesty's displeasure at Bolkonski's
22672. not having served since 1805.
22673. 
22674. "I know myself that one cannot help one's sympathies and antipathies,"
22675. thought Prince Andrew, "so it will not do to present my proposal for
22676. the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor personally, but the
22677. project will speak for itself."
22678. 
22679. He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend of
22680. his father's. The field marshal made an appointment to see him, received
22681. him graciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few days later
22682. Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the Minister of
22683. War, Count Arakcheev.
22684. 
22685. 
22686. On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakcheev's waiting
22687. room at nine in the morning.
22688. 
22689. He did not know Arakcheev personally, had never seen him, and all he had
22690. heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.
22691. 
22692. "He is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not
22693. concern myself about his personal qualities: he has been commissioned
22694. to consider my project, so he alone can get it adopted," thought Prince
22695. Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people
22696. in Count Arakcheev's waiting room.
22697. 
22698. During his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the
22699. anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms
22700. were well known to him. Count Arakcheev's anteroom had quite a special
22701. character. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for
22702. an audience showed embarrassment and servility; the faces of those of
22703. higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness, covered by a mask
22704. of unconcern and ridicule of themselves, their situation, and the person
22705. for whom they were waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and down,
22706. others whispered and laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname "Sila
22707. Andreevich" and the words, "Uncle will give it to us hot," in reference
22708. to Count Arakcheev. One general (an important personage), evidently
22709. feeling offended at having to wait so long, sat crossing and uncrossing
22710. his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.
22711. 
22712. But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all
22713. faces--that of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the
22714. adjutant on duty to take in his name, but received an ironical look and
22715. was told that his turn would come in due course. After some others had
22716. been shown in and out of the minister's room by the adjutant on duty,
22717. an officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and frightened
22718. air was admitted at that terrible door. This officer's audience lasted
22719. a long time. Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard
22720. from the other side of the door, and the officer--with pale face and
22721. trembling lips--came out and passed through the waiting room, clutching
22722. his head.
22723. 
22724. After this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on
22725. duty said in a whisper, "To the right, at the window."
22726. 
22727. Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of
22728. forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles,
22729. scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red
22730. nose. Arakcheev turned his head toward him without looking at him.
22731. 
22732. "What is your petition?" asked Arakcheev.
22733. 
22734. "I am not petitioning, your excellency," returned Prince Andrew quietly.
22735. 
22736. Arakcheev's eyes turned toward him.
22737. 
22738. "Sit down," said he. "Prince Bolkonski?"
22739. 
22740. "I am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the Emperor has
22741. deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me..."
22742. 
22743. "You see, my dear sir, I have read your project," interrupted Arakcheev,
22744. uttering only the first words amiably and then--again without looking
22745. at Prince Andrew--relapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt.
22746. "You are proposing new military laws? There are many laws but no one to
22747. carry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody designs laws, it is easier
22748. writing than doing."
22749. 
22750. "I came at His Majesty the Emperor's wish to learn from your excellency
22751. how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have presented," said
22752. Prince Andrew politely.
22753. 
22754. "I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the
22755. committee. I do not approve of it," said Arakcheev, rising and taking a
22756. paper from his writing table. "Here!" and he handed it to Prince Andrew.
22757. 
22758. Across the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters,
22759. misspelled, and without punctuation: "Unsoundly constructed because
22760. resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles
22761. of War needlessly deviating."
22762. 
22763. "To what committee has the memorandum been referred?" inquired Prince
22764. Andrew.
22765. 
22766. "To the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended that your
22767. honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary."
22768. 
22769. Prince Andrew smiled.
22770. 
22771. "I don't want one."
22772. 
22773. "A member without salary," repeated Arakcheev. "I have the honor...
22774. Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?" he shouted, bowing to Prince
22775. Andrew.
22776. 
22777. 
22778. 
22779. 
22780. 
22781. CHAPTER V
22782. 
22783. 
22784. While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee
22785. Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances, particularly those he
22786. knew to be in power and whose aid he might need. In Petersburg he now
22787. experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle, when
22788. troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling
22789. circles where the future, on which the fate of millions depended, was
22790. being shaped. From the irritation of the older men, the curiosity of the
22791. uninitiated, the reserve of the initiated, the hurry and preoccupation
22792. of everyone, and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose
22793. existence he learned every day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in
22794. Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation, the commander in
22795. chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know, but who
22796. was supposed to be a man of genius--Speranski. And this movement of
22797. reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and Speranski
22798. its chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question
22799. of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his
22800. consciousness.
22801. 
22802. Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the
22803. highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming
22804. party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because
22805. he was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by
22806. liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal.
22807. The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations,
22808. turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the
22809. reforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine
22810. society world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a
22811. good match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account
22812. of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this
22813. the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had
22814. greatly improved during these last five years, having softened and grown
22815. more manly, lost his former affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony,
22816. and acquired the serenity that comes with years. People talked about
22817. him, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him.
22818. 
22819. The day after his interview with Count Arakcheev, Prince Andrew spent
22820. the evening at Count Kochubey's. He told the count of his interview with
22821. Sila Andreevich (Kochubey spoke of Arakcheev by that nickname with the
22822. same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the Minister of War's
22823. anteroom).
22824. 
22825. "Mon cher, even in this case you can't do without Michael Mikhaylovich
22826. Speranski. He manages everything. I'll speak to him. He has promised to
22827. come this evening."
22828. 
22829. "What has Speranski to do with the army regulations?" asked Prince
22830. Andrew.
22831. 
22832. Kochubey shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at Bolkonski's
22833. simplicity.
22834. 
22835. "We were talking to him about you a few days ago," Kochubey continued,
22836. "and about your freed plowmen."
22837. 
22838. "Oh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?" said an old man of
22839. Catherine's day, turning contemptuously toward Bolkonski.
22840. 
22841. "It was a small estate that brought in no profit," replied Prince
22842. Andrew, trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man
22843. uselessly.
22844. 
22845. "Afraid of being late..." said the old man, looking at Kochubey.
22846. 
22847. "There's one thing I don't understand," he continued. "Who will plow the
22848. land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but difficult to
22849. rule.... Just the same as now--I ask you, Count--who will be heads of
22850. the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?"
22851. 
22852. "Those who pass the examinations, I suppose," replied Kochubey, crossing
22853. his legs and glancing round.
22854. 
22855. "Well, I have Pryanichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a
22856. priceless man, but he's sixty. Is he to go up for examination?"
22857. 
22858. "Yes, that's a difficulty, as education is not at all general, but..."
22859. 
22860. Count Kochubey did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew by the arm,
22861. and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a large open
22862. forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness, who was
22863. just entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a cross
22864. suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It was Speranski.
22865. Prince Andrew recognized him at once, and felt a throb within him, as
22866. happens at critical moments of life. Whether it was from respect, envy,
22867. or anticipation, he did not know. Speranski's whole figure was of a
22868. peculiar type that made him easily recognizable. In the society in which
22869. Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward
22870. and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance; he
22871. had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those
22872. half-closed, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that expressed
22873. nothing; nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft voice; above all
22874. he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands--hands which
22875. were broad, but very plump, soft, and white. Such whiteness and softness
22876. Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long
22877. in hospital. This was Speranski, Secretary of State, reporter to the
22878. Emperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he had more than once met and
22879. talked with Napoleon.
22880. 
22881. Speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people
22882. involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to
22883. speak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and
22884. he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.
22885. 
22886. Prince Andrew followed Speranski's every word and movement with
22887. particular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men
22888. who judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting
22889. anyone new--especially anyone whom, like Speranski, he knew by
22890. reputation--expected to discover in him the perfection of human
22891. qualities.
22892. 
22893. Speranski told Kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner
22894. as he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that the Emperor
22895. had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty.
22896. When Kochubey introduced Prince Andrew, Speranski slowly turned his eyes
22897. to Bolkonski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence.
22898. 
22899. "I am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as
22900. everyone has," he said after a pause.
22901. 
22902. Kochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had given
22903. Bolkonski. Speranski smiled more markedly.
22904. 
22905. "The chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend
22906. Monsieur Magnitski," he said, fully articulating every word and
22907. syllable, "and if you like I can put you in touch with him." He paused
22908. at the full stop. "I hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to
22909. co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable."
22910. 
22911. A circle soon formed round Speranski, and the old man who had talked
22912. about his subordinate Pryanichnikov addressed a question to him.
22913. 
22914. Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement
22915. of Speranski's: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity
22916. student, who now, Bolkonski thought, held in his hands--those plump
22917. white hands--the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the
22918. extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Speranski answered
22919. the old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from an
22920. immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud, Speranski
22921. smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of
22922. what pleased the sovereign.
22923. 
22924. Having talked for a little while in the general circle, Speranski rose
22925. and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the
22926. room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in
22927. Bolkonski.
22928. 
22929. "I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated
22930. conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me," he said
22931. with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he
22932. and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom
22933. he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. "I have known of
22934. you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your serfs,
22935. a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should be more
22936. imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the
22937. chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree
22938. concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much
22939. gossip and tittle-tattle."
22940. 
22941. "No," said Prince Andrew, "my father did not wish me to take advantage
22942. of the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade."
22943. 
22944. "Your father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above our
22945. contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishes
22946. natural justice."
22947. 
22948. "I think, however, that these condemnations have some ground," returned
22949. Prince Andrew, trying to resist Speranski's influence, of which he began
22950. to be conscious. He did not like to agree with him in everything and
22951. felt a wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke easily and well,
22952. he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with
22953. Speranski. He was too much absorbed in observing the famous man's
22954. personality.
22955. 
22956. "Grounds of personal ambition maybe," Speranski put in quietly.
22957. 
22958. "And of state interest to some extent," said Prince Andrew.
22959. 
22960. "What do you mean?" asked Speranski quietly, lowering his eyes.
22961. 
22962. "I am an admirer of Montesquieu," replied Prince Andrew, "and his idea
22963. that le principe des monarchies est l'honneur me parait incontestable.
22964. Certains droits et privileges de la noblesse me paraissent etre des
22965. moyens de soutenir ce sentiment." *
22966. 
22967. 
22968.      * "The principle of monarchies is honor seems to me
22969.      incontestable. Certain rights and privileges for the
22970.      aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that
22971.      sentiment."
22972. 
22973. 
22974. The smile vanished from Speranski's white face, which was much improved
22975. by the change. Probably Prince Andrew's thought interested him.
22976. 
22977. "Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue," * he began,
22978. pronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower
22979. than in Russian but quite calmly.
22980. 
22981. 
22982.     * "If you regard the question from that point of view."
22983. 
22984. 
22985. Speranski went on to say that honor, l'honeur, cannot be upheld by
22986. privileges harmful to the service; that honor, l'honneur, is either a
22987. negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of
22988. emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which recognize it.
22989. His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.
22990. 
22991. "An institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one similar
22992. to the Legion d'honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, not harmful
22993. but helpful to the success of the service, but not a class or court
22994. privilege."
22995. 
22996. "I do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges
22997. have attained the same end," returned Prince Andrew. "Every courtier
22998. considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily."
22999. 
23000. "Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince," said
23001. Speranski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an
23002. argument which was embarrassing for his companion. "If you will do
23003. me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday," he added, "I will, after
23004. talking with Magnitski, let you know what may interest you, and shall
23005. also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you."
23006. 
23007. Closing his eyes, he bowed a la francaise, without taking leave, and
23008. trying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room.
23009. 
23010. 
23011. 
23012. 
23013. 
23014. CHAPTER VI
23015. 
23016. 
23017. During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the
23018. whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite
23019. overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city.
23020. 
23021. On returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four
23022. or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours. The mechanism
23023. of life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere,
23024. absorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did nothing, did
23025. not even think or find time to think, but only talked, and talked
23026. successfully, of what he had thought while in the country.
23027. 
23028. He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same
23029. remark on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy for
23030. whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking
23031. of nothing.
23032. 
23033. As he had done on their first meeting at Kochubey's, Speranski produced
23034. a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when he
23035. received him tete-a-tate at his own house and talked to him long and
23036. confidentially.
23037. 
23038. To Bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant
23039. creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that
23040. perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in
23041. Speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous
23042. man. Had Speranski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed
23043. the same breeding and traditions, Bolkonski would soon have discovered
23044. his weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, Speranski's strange and
23045. logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he
23046. did not quite understand him. Moreover, Speranski, either because he
23047. appreciated the other's capacity or because he considered it necessary
23048. to win him to his side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness
23049. before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which
23050. goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption
23051. that one's companion is the only man besides oneself capable of
23052. understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness
23053. and profundity of one's own ideas.
23054. 
23055. During their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speranski more than
23056. once remarked: "We regard everything that is above the common level of
23057. rooted custom..." or, with a smile: "But we want the wolves to be fed
23058. and the sheep to be safe..." or: "They cannot understand this..." and
23059. all in a way that seemed to say: "We, you and I, understand what they
23060. are and who we are."
23061. 
23062. This first long conversation with Speranski only strengthened in Prince
23063. Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting.
23064. He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by
23065. his energy and persistence had attained power, which he was using solely
23066. for the welfare of Russia. In Prince Andrew's eyes Speranski was the man
23067. he would himself have wished to be--one who explained all the facts of
23068. life reasonably, considered important only what was rational, and was
23069. capable of applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything
23070. seemed so simple and clear in Speranski's exposition that Prince Andrew
23071. involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied and
23072. argued, it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and
23073. not submit to Speranski's opinions entirely. Everything was right and
23074. everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince
23075. Andrew. This was Speranski's cold, mirrorlike look, which did not allow
23076. one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands, which Prince
23077. Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who
23078. possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated
23079. Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was unpleasantly struck, too, by the
23080. excessive contempt for others that he observed in Speranski, and by the
23081. diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions. He
23082. made use of every kind of mental device, except analogy, and passed too
23083. boldly, it seemed to Prince Andrew, from one to another. Now he would
23084. take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers; now that
23085. of a satirist, and laugh ironically at his opponents; now grow severely
23086. logical, or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics. (This last
23087. resource was one he very frequently employed.) He would transfer a
23088. question to metaphysical heights, pass on to definitions of space, time,
23089. and thought, and, having deduced the refutation he needed, would again
23090. descend to the level of the original discussion.
23091. 
23092. In general the trait of Speranski's mentality which struck Prince Andrew
23093. most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority
23094. of reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur to him
23095. which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is after all
23096. impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had never felt the
23097. doubt, "Is not all I think and believe nonsense?" And it was just this
23098. peculiarity of Speranski's mind that particularly attracted Prince
23099. Andrew.
23100. 
23101. During the first period of their acquaintance Bolkonski felt a
23102. passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for
23103. Bonaparte. The fact that Speranski was the son of a village priest, and
23104. that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humble
23105. origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to cherish his
23106. sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to strengthen it.
23107. 
23108. On that first evening Bolkonski spent with him, having mentioned the
23109. Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Speranski told him
23110. sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty
23111. years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf
23112. had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes.
23113. 
23114. "And that is all the state has for the millions it has spent," said he.
23115. "We want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have no laws.
23116. That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to serve in these
23117. times!"
23118. 
23119. Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was
23120. needed which he did not possess.
23121. 
23122. "But nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious circle
23123. from which we must break a way out."
23124. 
23125. A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army
23126. Regulations and--what he had not at all expected--was chairman of a
23127. section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At Speranski's
23128. request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up
23129. and, with the aid of the Code Napoleon and the Institutes of Justinian,
23130. he worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights.
23131. 
23132. 
23133. 
23134. 
23135. 
23136. CHAPTER VII
23137. 
23138. 
23139. Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg
23140. after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading
23141. position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral
23142. lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various
23143. lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection
23144. of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms,
23145. in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular.
23146. He supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in
23147. Petersburg.
23148. 
23149. His life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations and
23150. dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered
23151. it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the
23152. bachelor circles in which he moved.
23153. 
23154. Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at
23155. the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest
23156. upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him.
23157. At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the
23158. closer bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had joined
23159. the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently
23160. steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot down it
23161. sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground, he put
23162. his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and
23163. involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.
23164. 
23165. Joseph Alexeevich was not in Petersburg--he had of late stood aside
23166. from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost entirely in
23167. Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary
23168. life, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in
23169. Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or Ivan Vasilevich D., whom he knew in
23170. society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under the Masonic aprons
23171. and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in
23172. ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up twenty
23173. to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen
23174. members, of whom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre
23175. remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote
23176. all his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to
23177. dwell arose in his soul.
23178. 
23179. He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first he
23180. put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges
23181. or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical
23182. science of the order: with questions of the threefold designation of
23183. God, the three primordial elements--sulphur, mercury, and salt--or
23184. the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of
23185. Solomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones
23186. chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought, Joseph Alexeevich himself,
23187. but he did not share their interests. His heart was not in the mystical
23188. aspect of Freemasonry.
23189. 
23190. In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him,
23191. seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight
23192. and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.
23193. 
23194. In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw
23195. nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized
23196. the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their
23197. purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master
23198. of the principal lodge.
23199. 
23200. Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,
23201. particularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierre's
23202. observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for
23203. anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy
23204. young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank,
23205. and of whom there were very many in the lodge.
23206. 
23207. Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry,
23208. at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely
23209. on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but
23210. suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated
23211. from its original principles. And so toward the end of the year he went
23212. abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order.
23213. 
23214. In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our Freemasons knew
23215. from correspondence with those abroad that Bezukhov had obtained the
23216. confidence of many highly placed persons, had been initiated into many
23217. mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, and was bringing back with
23218. him much that might conduce to the advantage of the Masonic cause
23219. in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him, tried to
23220. ingratiate themselves with him, and it seemed to them all that he was
23221. preparing something for them and concealing it.
23222. 
23223. A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at
23224. which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what
23225. he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order. The
23226. meeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began
23227. his address.
23228. 
23229. "Dear Brothers," he began, blushing and stammering, with a written
23230. speech in his hand, "it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in
23231. the seclusion of our lodge--we must act--act! We are drowsing, but we
23232. must act." Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.
23233. 
23234. "For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph
23235. of virtue," he read, "we must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse
23236. principles in harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the
23237. education of the young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the
23238. wisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity, and
23239. folly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity
23240. of purpose and possessed of authority and power.
23241. 
23242. "To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice
23243. and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this world,
23244. receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we
23245. are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today. What is
23246. to be done in these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow
23247. everything, repel force by force?... No! We are very far from that.
23248. Every violent reform deserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy
23249. evil while men remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no
23250. violence.
23251. 
23252. "The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing
23253. men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction--aiming
23254. at the punishment of vice and folly, and patronizing talent and virtue:
23255. raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our Brotherhood.
23256. Only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands
23257. of the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being
23258. aware of it. In a word, we must found a form of government holding
23259. universal sway, which should be diffused over the whole world without
23260. destroying the bonds of citizenship, and beside which all other
23261. governments can continue in their customary course and do everything
23262. except what impedes the great aim of our order, which is to obtain for
23263. virtue the victory over vice. This aim was that of Christianity itself.
23264. It taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow
23265. the example and instruction of the best and wisest men.
23266. 
23267. "At that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching alone
23268. was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her with
23269. special strength, but now we need much more powerful methods. It is
23270. now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue
23271. a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate the
23272. passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it is
23273. therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions
23274. within the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means to that end.
23275. 
23276. "As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state,
23277. each of them again training two others and all being closely united,
23278. everything will be possible for our order, which has already in secret
23279. accomplished much for the welfare of mankind."
23280. 
23281. This speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in
23282. the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous designs
23283. of Illuminism, * met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The Grand
23284. Master began answering him, and Pierre began developing his views with
23285. more and more warmth. It was long since there had been so stormy a
23286. meeting. Parties were formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others
23287. supporting him. At that meeting he was struck for the first time by
23288. the endless variety of men's minds, which prevents a truth from ever
23289. presenting itself identically to two persons. Even those members
23290. who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with
23291. limitations and alterations he could not agree to, as what he always
23292. wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself
23293. understood it.
23294. 
23295. 
23296.      * The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for
23297.      monarchical institutions.
23298. 
23299. 
23300. At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will
23301. reproved Bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue
23302. alone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute.
23303. Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would
23304. be accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for the
23305. usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.
23306. 
23307. 
23308. 
23309. 
23310. 
23311. CHAPTER VIII
23312. 
23313. 
23314. Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For three
23315. days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at
23316. home receiving no one and going nowhere.
23317. 
23318. It was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who implored
23319. him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she
23320. wished to devote her whole life to him.
23321. 
23322. At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would
23323. return to Petersburg from abroad.
23324. 
23325. Following this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected
23326. less than the others forced his way in to see him and, turning the
23327. conversation upon Pierre's matrimonial affairs, by way of fraternal
23328. advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong
23329. and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not
23330. forgiving the penitent.
23331. 
23332. At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vasili's wife, sent to
23333. him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most
23334. important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and
23335. that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then
23336. was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him.
23337. Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the
23338. influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his
23339. liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife.
23340. 
23341. "No one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to blame," he
23342. thought.
23343. 
23344. If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it
23345. was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take
23346. any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away.
23347. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference
23348. whether he lived with his wife or not?
23349. 
23350. Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late
23351. one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph
23352. Alexeevich. This is what he noted in his diary:
23353. 
23354. 
23355. Moscow, 17th November
23356. 
23357. I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what
23358. I have experienced. Joseph Alexeevich is living poorly and has for three
23359. years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has
23360. ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till
23361. late at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working
23362. at science. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed
23363. on which he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of
23364. Jerusalem, and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild
23365. smile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges.
23366. I told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed
23367. to our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of
23368. my rupture with the Brothers. Joseph Alexeevich, having remained silent
23369. and thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which
23370. at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow.
23371. He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of
23372. the order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The
23373. purification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The
23374. improvement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which
23375. is the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and
23376. self-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently
23377. of circumstances. But at the same time just this aim demands the
23378. greatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of
23379. this aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our
23380. impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of
23381. the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and
23382. profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is
23383. attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground
23384. Joseph Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the
23385. depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he
23386. said to me, "the chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in
23387. perfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties
23388. of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary,
23389. my dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain
23390. our three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge--for man can only know himself
23391. by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by
23392. conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue--love of death.
23393. Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our
23394. innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life." These words are all
23395. the more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings,
23396. Joseph Alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death, for
23397. which--in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man--he does
23398. not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained
23399. to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out
23400. to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He
23401. advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but
23402. to take up only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while
23403. diverting the Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path
23404. self-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for
23405. myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end
23406. he gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which I will
23407. in future note down all my actions.
23408. 
23409. 
23410. Petersburg, 23rd November
23411. 
23412. I am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears and
23413. said that Helene was here and that she implored me to hear her; that she
23414. was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I knew that if
23415. I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on refusing
23416. what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and advice
23417. to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do.
23418. I went to my room and reread Joseph Alexeevich's letters and recalled
23419. my conversations with him, and deduced from it all that I ought not
23420. to refuse a suppliant, and ought to reach a helping hand to
23421. everyone--especially to one so closely bound to me--and that I must bear
23422. my cross. But if I forgive her for the sake of doing right, then let
23423. union with her have only a spiritual aim. That is what I decided, and
23424. what I wrote to Joseph Alexeevich. I told my wife that I begged her to
23425. forget the past, to forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her, and
23426. that I had nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She need
23427. not know how hard it was for me to see her again. I have settled on the
23428. upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of
23429. regeneration.
23430. 
23431. 
23432. 
23433. 
23434. 
23435. CHAPTER IX
23436. 
23437. 
23438. At that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at court
23439. and at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each with its
23440. own particular tone. The largest of these was the French circle of the
23441. Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count Rumyantsev and Caulaincourt.
23442. In this group Helene, as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with her
23443. husband, took a very prominent place. She was visited by the members of
23444. the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for
23445. their intellect and polished manners.
23446. 
23447. Helene had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors
23448. and had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic
23449. notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. Napoleon himself
23450. had noticed her in the theater and said of her: "C'est un superbe
23451. animal." * Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise
23452. Pierre, for she had become even handsomer than before. What did surprise
23453. him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded in
23454. gaining the reputation "d' une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle que
23455. belle." *(2) The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page
23456. letters. Bilibin saved up his epigrams to produce them in Countess
23457. Bezukhova's presence. To be received in the Countess Bezukhova's salon
23458. was regarded as a diploma of intellect. Young men read books before
23459. attending Helene's evenings, to have something to say in her salon, and
23460. secretaries of the embassy, and even ambassadors, confided diplomatic
23461. secrets to her, so that in a way Helene was a power. Pierre, who knew
23462. she was very stupid, sometimes attended, with a strange feeling of
23463. perplexity and fear, her evenings and dinner parties, where politics,
23464. poetry, and philosophy were discussed. At these parties his feelings
23465. were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be found
23466. out at any moment. But whether because stupidity was just what was
23467. needed to run such a salon, or because those who were deceived found
23468. pleasure in the deception, at any rate it remained unexposed and Helene
23469. Bezukhova's reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly
23470. established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and
23471. everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a
23472. profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception.
23473. 
23474. 
23475.      * "That's a superb animal."
23476. 
23477.      * (2) "Of a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely."
23478. 
23479. 
23480. Pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He was
23481. that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no one's
23482. way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the
23483. drawing room, he served, by the contrast he presented to her, as an
23484. advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during
23485. the last two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract
23486. interests and his sincere contempt for all else, had acquired in his
23487. wife's circle, which did not interest him, that air of unconcern,
23488. indifference, and benevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired
23489. artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect. He entered
23490. his wife's drawing room as one enters a theater, was acquainted with
23491. everybody, equally pleased to see everyone, and equally indifferent to
23492. them all. Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him
23493. and, regardless of whether any "gentlemen of the embassy" were present
23494. or not, lispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not at all
23495. in accord with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general opinion
23496. concerning the queer husband of "the most distinguished woman in
23497. Petersburg" was so well established that no one took his freaks
23498. seriously.
23499. 
23500. Among the many young men who frequented her house every day, Boris
23501. Drubetskoy, who had already achieved great success in the service, was
23502. the most intimate friend of the Bezukhov household since Helene's return
23503. from Erfurt. Helene spoke of him as "mon page" and treated him like a
23504. child. Her smile for him was the same as for everybody, but sometimes
23505. that smile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him Boris behaved with a
23506. particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade of deference also
23507. disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three years before
23508. from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he now
23509. protected himself from the danger of its repetition, first by not being
23510. a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect.
23511. 
23512. "No, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced
23513. her former infatuations," he told himself. "There has never been
23514. an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the
23515. heart"--a statement which, though gathered from an unknown source, he
23516. believed implicitly. Yet strange to say Boris' presence in his wife's
23517. drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a physical effect upon
23518. Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and
23519. freedom of his movements.
23520. 
23521. "What a strange antipathy," thought Pierre, "yet I used to like him very
23522. much."
23523. 
23524. In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather blind
23525. and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who did
23526. nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured fellow. But
23527. a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place
23528. all this time in Pierre's soul, revealing much to him and causing him
23529. many spiritual doubts and joys.
23530. 
23531. 
23532. 
23533. 
23534. 
23535. CHAPTER X
23536. 
23537. 
23538. Pierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during
23539. that time:
23540. 
23541. 
23542. 24th November
23543. 
23544. Got up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. (By Joseph
23545. Alexeevich's advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and
23546. served on one of the committees.) Returned home for dinner and dined
23547. alone--the countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and drank
23548. moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers.
23549. In the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about
23550. B., and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody
23551. laughed loudly at it.
23552. 
23553. I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me to
23554. walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation,
23555. (2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, (3) to withdraw
23556. from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family
23557. duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the management of my affairs.
23558. 
23559. 
23560. 27th November
23561. 
23562. I got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God,
23563. help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures,
23564. but without proper feeling. Brother Urusov came and we talked about
23565. worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperor's new projects. I began to
23566. criticize them, but remembered my rules and my benefactor's words--that
23567. a true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid
23568. is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist. My tongue
23569. is my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O. visited me and we had a preliminary
23570. talk about the reception of a new Brother. They laid on me the duty of
23571. Rhetor. I feel myself weak and unworthy. Then our talk turned to the
23572. interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the Temple, the seven
23573. sciences, the seven virtues, the seven vices, and the seven gifts of the
23574. Holy Spirit. Brother O. was very eloquent. In the evening the admission
23575. took place. The new decoration of the Premises contributed much to the
23576. magnificence of the spectacle. It was Boris Drubetskoy who was admitted.
23577. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A strange feeling agitated me all
23578. the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber. I caught myself
23579. harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I vainly tried to
23580. overcome. That is why I should really like to save him from evil and
23581. lead him into the path of truth, but evil thoughts of him did not leave
23582. me. It seemed to me that his object in entering the Brotherhood was
23583. merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge. Apart
23584. from the fact that he had asked me several times whether N. and S. were
23585. members of our lodge (a question to which I could not reply) and that
23586. according to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our
23587. holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man to
23588. desire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to doubt him, but he seemed
23589. to me insincere, and all the time I stood alone with him in the dark
23590. temple it seemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words,
23591. and I wished really to stab his bare breast with the sword I held to it.
23592. I could not be eloquent, nor could I frankly mention my doubts to the
23593. Brothers and to the Grand Master. Great Architect of Nature, help me to
23594. find the true path out of the labyrinth of lies!
23595. 
23596. 
23597.  After this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then
23598. the following was written:
23599. 
23600. 
23601. I have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who
23602. advised me to hold fast by brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was
23603. revealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim
23604. is the name of the ruler of all. The third name is the name unutterable
23605. which means the All. Talks with Brother V. strengthen, refresh, and
23606. support me in the path of virtue. In his presence doubt has no place.
23607. The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our
23608. sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human sciences dissect
23609. everything to comprehend it, and kill everything to examine it. In the
23610. holy science of our order all is one, all is known in its entirety and
23611. life. The Trinity--the three elements of matter--are sulphur, mercury,
23612. and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature; in combination with
23613. salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means
23614. of which it attracts mercury, seizes it, holds it, and in combination
23615. produces other bodies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence.
23616. Christ, the Holy Spirit, Him!...
23617. 
23618. 
23619. 3rd December
23620. 
23621. Awoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went and
23622. paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead my
23623. imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when Dolokhov,
23624. meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying
23625. perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife's absence. At the time I gave
23626. him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in my
23627. mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies. I recollected
23628. myself and drove away that thought only when I found myself glowing with
23629. anger, but I did not sufficiently repent. Afterwards Boris Drubetskoy
23630. came and began relating various adventures. His coming vexed me from the
23631. first, and I said something disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared
23632. up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him. He became
23633. silent, and I recollected myself only when it was too late. My God, I
23634. cannot get on with him at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set
23635. myself above him and so become much worse than he, for he is lenient
23636. to my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God,
23637. grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave
23638. so that he too may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was
23639. drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, "Thy day!"
23640. 
23641. I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by
23642. dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left
23643. thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it with
23644. my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began
23645. biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the bigger and
23646. heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking my arm, led
23647. me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank.
23648. I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a
23649. fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After much effort I
23650. dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on
23651. the other. I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and
23652. pointing me to a broad avenue and garden, and in the garden was a large
23653. and beautiful building. I woke up. O Lord, great Architect of Nature,
23654. help me to tear from myself these dogs--my passions especially the last,
23655. which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones, and aid me
23656. to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in my
23657. dream.
23658. 
23659. 
23660. 7th December
23661. 
23662. I dreamed that Joseph Alexeevich was sitting in my house, and that I
23663. was very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered
23664. incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could
23665. not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him. But
23666. as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young,
23667. and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order,
23668. but so softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left
23669. the room and something strange happened. We were sitting or lying on
23670. the floor. He was telling me something, and I wished to show him my
23671. sensibility, and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing
23672. to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying
23673. me. And tears came into my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this. But he
23674. looked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off his remarks. I
23675. felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern
23676. me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind look, and then we suddenly
23677. found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed. He lay down
23678. on the edge of it and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down
23679. too. And he said, "Tell me frankly what is your chief temptation? Do
23680. you know it? I think you know it already." Abashed by this question,
23681. I replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his head
23682. incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living
23683. with my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. To
23684. this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one's embraces and
23685. gave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied that I should
23686. be ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I awoke and
23687. found in my mind the text from the Gospel: "The life was the light of
23688. men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it
23689. not." Joseph Alexeevich's face had looked young and bright. That day I
23690. received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about "conjugal
23691. duties."
23692. 
23693. 
23694. 9th December
23695. 
23696. I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw that
23697. I was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and Joseph
23698. Alexeevich came in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at once that
23699. the process of regeneration had already taken place in him, and I rushed
23700. to meet him. I embraced him and kissed his hands, and he said, "Hast
23701. thou noticed that my face is different?" I looked at him, still holding
23702. him in my arms, and saw that his face was young, but that he had no hair
23703. on his head and his features were quite changed. And I said, "I should
23704. have known you had I met you by chance," and I thought to myself, "Am I
23705. telling the truth?" And suddenly I saw him lying like a dead body; then
23706. he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large
23707. book of sheets of drawing paper; I said, "I drew that," and he answered
23708. by bowing his head. I opened the book, and on all the pages there
23709. were excellent drawings. And in my dream I knew that these drawings
23710. represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved. And on
23711. its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent
23712. garments and with a transparent body, flying up to the clouds. And I
23713. seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation
23714. of the Song of Songs. And looking at those drawings I dreamed I felt
23715. that I was doing wrong, but could not tear myself away from them. Lord,
23716. help me! My God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy will be done; but
23717. if I am myself the cause, teach me what I should do! I shall perish of
23718. my debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!
23719. 
23720. 
23721. 
23722. 
23723. 
23724. CHAPTER XI
23725. 
23726. 
23727. The Rostovs' monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they
23728. had spent in the country.
23729. 
23730. Though Nicholas Rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was still
23731. serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little,
23732. the way of life at Otradnoe--Mitenka's management of affairs, in
23733. particular--was such that the debts inevitably increased every year. The
23734. only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply
23735. for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and
23736. also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time.
23737. 
23738. Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Vera and was
23739. accepted.
23740. 
23741. Though in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to the best society without
23742. themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of
23743. acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were
23744. provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without
23745. inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.
23746. 
23747. The Rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow,
23748. and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country neighbors from
23749. Otradnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters, Peronskaya a
23750. maid of honor, Pierre Bezukhov, and the son of their district postmaster
23751. who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the men who very soon
23752. became frequent visitors at the Rostovs' house in Petersburg were Boris,
23753. Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with
23754. him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rostovs' and paid the eldest
23755. daughter, Countess Vera, the attentions a young man pays when he intends
23756. to propose.
23757. 
23758. Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at
23759. Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He
23760. narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that
23761. everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had
23762. obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.
23763. 
23764. In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked
23765. up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near
23766. the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had
23767. done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and
23768. so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do
23769. this, and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also. In
23770. 1809 he was a captain in the Guards, wore medals, and held some special
23771. lucrative posts in Petersburg.
23772. 
23773. Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg's merits, it could not be
23774. denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent terms
23775. with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career before
23776. him and an assured position in society.
23777. 
23778. Four years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow
23779. theater, Berg had pointed out Vera Rostova to him and had said in
23780. German, "das soll mein Weib werden," * and from that moment had made up
23781. his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered the Rostovs'
23782. position and his own, he decided that the time had come to propose.
23783. 
23784. 
23785.     * "That girl shall be my wife."
23786. 
23787. 
23788. Berg's proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not
23789. flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure
23790. Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rostova; but
23791. Berg's chief characteristic was such a naive and good natured egotism
23792. that the Rostovs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing,
23793. since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good, indeed
23794. excellent. Moreover, the Rostovs' affairs were seriously embarrassed, as
23795. the suitor could not but know; and above all, Vera was twenty-four, had
23796. been taken out everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking
23797. and sensible, no one up to now had proposed to her. So they gave their
23798. consent.
23799. 
23800. "You see," said Berg to his comrade, whom he called "friend" only
23801. because he knew that everyone has friends, "you see, I have considered
23802. it all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out or if it
23803. were in any way unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and mamma
23804. are now provided for--I have arranged that rent for them in the Baltic
23805. Provinces--and I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with her fortune
23806. and my good management we can get along nicely. I am not marrying for
23807. money--I consider that dishonorable--but a wife should bring her
23808. share and a husband his. I have my position in the service, she has
23809. connections and some means. In our times that is worth something, isn't
23810. it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable girl, and she loves
23811. me..."
23812. 
23813. Berg blushed and smiled.
23814. 
23815. "And I love her, because her character is sensible and very good.
23816. Now the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite
23817. different--an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence.
23818. She is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my fiancee!... Well, you
23819. will be coming," he was going to say, "to dine," but changed his mind
23820. and said "to take tea with us," and quickly doubling up his tongue he
23821. blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying his dream
23822. of happiness.
23823. 
23824. After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Berg's
23825. proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took
23826. possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere.
23827. In the family's feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and
23828. constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved Vera
23829. sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands. The old
23830. count felt this most. He would probably have been unable to state
23831. the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from the state of his
23832. affairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what his debts amounted
23833. to, or what dowry he could give Vera. When his daughters were born
23834. he had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with three
23835. hundred serfs; but one of these estates had already been sold, and the
23836. other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would
23837. have to be sold, so that it was impossible to give it to Vera. Nor had
23838. he any money.
23839. 
23840. Berg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained before
23841. the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the
23842. question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At one time the
23843. count thought of giving her the Ryazan estate or of selling a forest, at
23844. another time of borrowing money on a note of hand. A few days before
23845. the wedding Berg entered the count's study early one morning and, with
23846. a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let him
23847. know what Vera's dowry would be. The count was so disconcerted by this
23848. long-foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply
23849. that came into his head. "I like your being businesslike about it.... I
23850. like it. You shall be satisfied...."
23851. 
23852. And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the
23853. conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not
23854. know for certain how much Vera would have and did not receive at least
23855. part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off.
23856. 
23857. "Because, consider, Count--if I allowed myself to marry now without
23858. having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting badly...."
23859. 
23860. The conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and to
23861. avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand
23862. for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the
23863. shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was impossible
23864. for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in
23865. ready money. "Or at least twenty thousand, Count," he added, "and then a
23866. note of hand for only sixty thousand."
23867. 
23868. "Yes, yes, all right!" said the count hurriedly. "Only excuse me, my
23869. dear fellow, I'll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty
23870. thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me."
23871. 
23872. 
23873. 
23874. 
23875. 
23876. CHAPTER XII
23877. 
23878. 
23879. Natasha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which she
23880. had counted on her fingers with Boris after they had kissed four years
23881. ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before Sonya and her mother, if
23882. Boris happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of that
23883. episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not worth
23884. mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question whether
23885. her engagement to Boris was a jest or an important, binding promise
23886. tormented her.
23887. 
23888. Since Boris left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the
23889. Rostovs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed near
23890. Otradnoe, but had never been to see them.
23891. 
23892. Sometimes it occurred to Natasha that he did not wish to see her, and
23893. this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke
23894. of him.
23895. 
23896. "Nowadays old friends are not remembered," the countess would say when
23897. Boris was mentioned.
23898. 
23899. Anna Mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed
23900. to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously
23901. and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on
23902. which he had entered. When the Rostovs came to Petersburg Boris called
23903. on them.
23904. 
23905. He drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Natasha was his
23906. most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of letting
23907. her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and
23908. Natasha could not be binding either on her or on him. He had a brilliant
23909. position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess Bezukhova,
23910. a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an
23911. important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and he was
23912. beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in
23913. Petersburg, plans which might very easily be realized. When he entered
23914. the Rostovs' drawing room Natasha was in her own room. When she heard
23915. of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room, flushed and beaming
23916. with a more than cordial smile.
23917. 
23918. Boris remembered Natasha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining from
23919. under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had known her
23920. four years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a different
23921. Natasha entered, and his face expressed rapturous astonishment. This
23922. expression on his face pleased Natasha.
23923. 
23924. "Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?" asked the
23925. countess.
23926. 
23927. Boris kissed Natasha's hand and said that he was astonished at the
23928. change in her.
23929. 
23930. "How handsome you have grown!"
23931. 
23932. "I should think so!" replied Natasha's laughing eyes.
23933. 
23934. "And is Papa older?" she asked.
23935. 
23936. Natasha sat down and, without joining in Boris' conversation with the
23937. countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood's suitor. He felt
23938. the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her
23939. occasionally.
23940. 
23941. Boris' uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were all
23942. comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This Natasha noticed at once.
23943. He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess, arranging
23944. with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand
23945. like a skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his
23946. lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg society, recalling
23947. with mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances. It was
23948. not accidentally, Natasha felt, that he alluded, when speaking of the
23949. highest aristocracy, to an ambassador's ball he had attended, and to
23950. invitations he had received from N.N. and S.S.
23951. 
23952. All this time Natasha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her
23953. brows. This gaze disturbed and confused Boris more and more. He looked
23954. round more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying.
23955. He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave. The
23956. same inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked at
23957. him. After his first visit Boris said to himself that Natasha attracted
23958. him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield to that feeling,
23959. because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would mean ruin to
23960. his career, while to renew their former relations without intending to
23961. marry her would be dishonorable. Boris made up his mind to avoid meeting
23962. Natasha, but despite that resolution he called again a few days later
23963. and began calling often and spending whole days at the Rostovs'. It
23964. seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with Natasha and tell
23965. her that the old times must be forgotten, that in spite of everything...
23966. she could not be his wife, that he had no means, and they would never
23967. let her marry him. But he failed to do so and felt awkward about
23968. entering on such an explanation. From day to day he became more and more
23969. entangled. It seemed to her mother and Sonya that Natasha was in love
23970. with Boris as of old. She sang him his favorite songs, showed him her
23971. album, making him write in it, did not allow him to allude to the past,
23972. letting it be understood how delightful was the present; and every day
23973. he went away in a fog, without having said what he meant to, and not
23974. knowing what he was doing or why he came, or how it would all end. He
23975. left off visiting Helene and received reproachful notes from her every
23976. day, and yet he continued to spend whole days with the Rostovs.
23977. 
23978. 
23979. 
23980. 
23981. 
23982. CHAPTER XIII
23983. 
23984. 
23985. One night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket,
23986. without her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing
23987. under her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and
23988. bowing to the ground in prayer, her door creaked and Natasha, also in
23989. a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in
23990. curlpapers, ran in. The countess--her prayerful mood dispelled--looked
23991. round and frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: "Can it be that
23992. this couch will be my grave?" Natasha, flushed and eager, seeing
23993. her mother in prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down, and
23994. unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing that
23995. her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and, rapidly
23996. slipping one little foot against the other, pushed off her slippers and
23997. jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave. This
23998. couch was high, with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than
23999. the one below. Natasha jumped on it, sank into the feather bed, rolled
24000. over to the wall, and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled
24001. down, raising her knees to her chin, kicking out and laughing almost
24002. inaudibly, now covering herself up head and all, and now peeping at her
24003. mother. The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a
24004. stern face, but seeing, that Natasha's head was covered, she smiled in
24005. her kind, weak way.
24006. 
24007. "Now then, now then!" said she.
24008. 
24009. "Mamma, can we have a talk? Yes?" said Natasha. "Now, just one on your
24010. throat and another... that'll do!" And seizing her mother round the
24011. neck, she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her mother
24012. Natasha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that however
24013. she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her
24014. or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.
24015. 
24016. "Well, what is it tonight?" said the mother, having arranged her pillows
24017. and waited until Natasha, after turning over a couple of times, had
24018. settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her arms, and
24019. assumed a serious expression.
24020. 
24021. These visits of Natasha's at night before the count returned from his
24022. club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and daughter.
24023. 
24024. "What is it tonight?--But I have to tell you..."
24025. 
24026. Natasha put her hand on her mother's mouth.
24027. 
24028. "About Boris... I know," she said seriously; "that's what I have come
24029. about. Don't say it--I know. No, do tell me!" and she removed her hand.
24030. "Tell me, Mamma! He's nice?"
24031. 
24032. "Natasha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say Boris is
24033. nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what then?...
24034. What are you thinking about? You have quite turned his head, I can see
24035. that...."
24036. 
24037. As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter. Natasha
24038. was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany
24039. sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the countess
24040. only saw her daughter's face in profile. That face struck her by its
24041. peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.
24042. 
24043. Natasha was listening and considering.
24044. 
24045. "Well, what then?" said she.
24046. 
24047. "You have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him? You
24048. know you can't marry him."
24049. 
24050. "Why not?" said Natasha, without changing her position.
24051. 
24052. "Because he is young, because he is poor, because he is a relation...
24053. and because you yourself don't love him."
24054. 
24055. "How do you know?"
24056. 
24057. "I know. It is not right, darling!"
24058. 
24059.  "But if I want to..." said Natasha.
24060. 
24061. "Leave off talking nonsense," said the countess.
24062. 
24063. "But if I want to..."
24064. 
24065. "Natasha, I am in earnest..."
24066. 
24067. Natasha did not let her finish. She drew the countess' large hand to
24068. her, kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned it
24069. over and began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between the
24070. knuckles, then the next knuckle, whispering, "January, February, March,
24071. April, May. Speak, Mamma, why don't you say anything? Speak!" said she,
24072. turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in
24073. that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say.
24074. 
24075. "It won't do, my love! Not everyone will understand this friendship
24076. dating from your childish days, and to see him so intimate with you may
24077. injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us, and above all
24078. it torments him for nothing. He may already have found a suitable and
24079. wealthy match, and now he's half crazy."
24080. 
24081. "Crazy?" repeated Natasha.
24082. 
24083. "I'll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin..."
24084. 
24085. "I know! Cyril Matveich... but he is old."
24086. 
24087. "He was not always old. But this is what I'll do, Natasha, I'll have a
24088. talk with Boris. He need not come so often...."
24089. 
24090. "Why not, if he likes to?"
24091. 
24092. "Because I know it will end in nothing...."
24093. 
24094. "How can you know? No, Mamma, don't speak to him! What nonsense!" said
24095. Natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property. "Well, I
24096. won't marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it." Natasha
24097. smiled and looked at her mother. "Not to marry, but just so," she added.
24098. 
24099. "How so, my pet?"
24100. 
24101. "Just so. There's no need for me to marry him. But... just so."
24102. 
24103. "Just so, just so," repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she
24104. went off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.
24105. 
24106. "Don't laugh, stop!" cried Natasha. "You're shaking the whole bed!
24107. You're awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait..." and she
24108. seized the countess' hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger,
24109. saying, "June," and continued, kissing, "July, August," on the other
24110. hand. "But, Mamma, is he very much in love? What do you think? Was
24111. anybody ever so much in love with you? And he's very nice, very, very
24112. nice. Only not quite my taste--he is so narrow, like the dining-room
24113. clock.... Don't you understand? Narrow, you know--gray, light gray..."
24114. 
24115. "What rubbish you're talking!" said the countess.
24116. 
24117. Natasha continued: "Don't you really understand? Nicholas would
24118. understand.... Bezukhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and he is
24119. square."
24120. 
24121. "You flirt with him too," said the countess, laughing.
24122. 
24123. "No, he is a Freemason, I have found out. He is fine, dark-blue and
24124. red.... How can I explain it to you?"
24125. 
24126. "Little countess!" the count's voice called from behind the door.
24127. "You're not asleep?" Natasha jumped up, snatched up her slippers, and
24128. ran barefoot to her own room.
24129. 
24130. It was a long time before she could sleep. She kept thinking that no one
24131. could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.
24132. 
24133. "Sonya?" she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little kitten
24134. with her enormous plait of hair. "No, how could she? She's virtuous. She
24135. fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know anything more. Even
24136. Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how clever I am and how...
24137. charming she is," she went on, speaking of herself in the third person,
24138. and imagining it was some very wise man--the wisest and best of
24139. men--who was saying it of her. "There is everything, everything in her,"
24140. continued this man. "She is unusually intelligent, charming... and
24141. then she is pretty, uncommonly pretty, and agile--she swims and rides
24142. splendidly... and her voice! One can really say it's a wonderful voice!"
24143. 
24144. She hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini, threw herself
24145. on her bed, laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately
24146. fall asleep, called Dunyasha the maid to put out the candle, and before
24147. Dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier
24148. world of dreams, where everything was as light and beautiful as in
24149. reality, and even more so because it was different.
24150. 
24151. 
24152. Next day the countess called Boris aside and had a talk with him, after
24153. which he ceased coming to the Rostovs'.
24154. 
24155. 
24156. 
24157. 
24158. 
24159. CHAPTER XIV
24160. 
24161. 
24162. On the thirty-first of December, New Year's Eve, 1809 - 10 an old
24163. grandee of Catherine's day was giving a ball and midnight supper. The
24164. diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.
24165. 
24166. The grandee's well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with
24167. innumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance
24168. which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but dozens of
24169. police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch.
24170. Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving, with red-liveried
24171. footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the carriages emerged men
24172. wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while ladies in satin and ermine
24173. cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them
24174. with a clatter, and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize
24175. at the entrance.
24176. 
24177. Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the
24178. crowd and caps were doffed.
24179. 
24180. "The Emperor?... No, a minister.... prince... ambassador. Don't you see
24181. the plumes?..." was whispered among the crowd.
24182. 
24183. One person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone and
24184. mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.
24185. 
24186. A third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rostovs, who were
24187. to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.
24188. 
24189. There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the
24190. Rostov family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive, that the
24191. dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be arranged as
24192. it should be.
24193. 
24194. Marya Ignatevna Peronskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at the
24195. court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the
24196. countess and piloted the provincial Rostovs in Petersburg high society,
24197. was to accompany them to the ball.
24198. 
24199. They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten
24200. o'clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were not
24201. yet dressed.
24202. 
24203. Natasha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight that
24204. morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day. All
24205. her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they
24206. all--she herself, Mamma, and Sonya--should be as well dressed as
24207. possible. Sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands. The
24208. countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and the two girls
24209. white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their bodices and their
24210. hair dressed a la grecque.
24211. 
24212. Everything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and
24213. ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork
24214. silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the
24215. hairdressing was almost done. Sonya was finishing dressing and so was
24216. the countess, but Natasha, who had bustled about helping them all, was
24217. behindhand. She was still sitting before a looking-glass with a dressing
24218. jacket thrown over her slender shoulders. Sonya stood ready dressed in
24219. the middle of the room and, pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her
24220. dainty finger, was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went
24221. through it.
24222. 
24223. "That's not the way, that's not the way, Sonya!" cried Natasha turning
24224. her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who
24225. was dressing it had not time to release. "That bow is not right. Come
24226. here!"
24227. 
24228. Sonya sat down and Natasha pinned the ribbon on differently.
24229. 
24230. "Allow me, Miss! I can't do it like that," said the maid who was holding
24231. Natasha's hair.
24232. 
24233. "Oh, dear! Well then, wait. That's right, Sonya."
24234. 
24235. "Aren't you ready? It is nearly ten," came the countess' voice.
24236. 
24237. "Directly! Directly! And you, Mamma?"
24238. 
24239. "I have only my cap to pin on."
24240. 
24241. "Don't do it without me!" called Natasha. "You won't do it right."
24242. 
24243. "But it's already ten."
24244. 
24245. They had decided to be at the ball by half past ten, and Natasha had
24246. still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.
24247. 
24248. When her hair was done, Natasha, in her short petticoat from under which
24249. her dancing shoes showed, and in her mother's dressing jacket, ran up to
24250. Sonya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother. Turning her mother's
24251. head this way and that, she fastened on the cap and, hurriedly kissing
24252. her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her
24253. skirt.
24254. 
24255. The cause of the delay was Natasha's skirt, which was too long. Two
24256. maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of
24257. thread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the
24258. countess and Sonya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment
24259. up high on one uplifted hand.
24260. 
24261. "Mavra, quicker, darling!"
24262. 
24263. "Give me my thimble, Miss, from there..."
24264. 
24265. "Whenever will you be ready?" asked the count coming to the door. "Here
24266. is some scent. Peronskaya must be tired of waiting."
24267. 
24268. "It's ready, Miss," said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze dress
24269. with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as if by
24270. this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what she
24271. held.
24272. 
24273. Natasha began putting on the dress.
24274. 
24275. "In a minute! In a minute! Don't come in, Papa!" she cried to her father
24276. as he opened the door--speaking from under the filmy skirt which still
24277. covered her whole face.
24278. 
24279. Sonya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in. He was
24280. wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and was perfumed
24281. and his hair pomaded.
24282. 
24283. "Oh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!" cried Natasha, as she stood in
24284. the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.
24285. 
24286. "If you please, Miss! allow me," said the maid, who on her knees was
24287. pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her
24288. mouth to the other with her tongue.
24289. 
24290. "Say what you like," exclaimed Sonya, in a despairing voice as she
24291. looked at Natasha, "say what you like, it's still too long."
24292. 
24293. Natasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dress was
24294. too long.
24295. 
24296. "Really, madam, it is not at all too long," said Mavra, crawling on her
24297. knees after her young lady.
24298. 
24299. "Well, if it's too long we'll take it up... we'll tack it up in one
24300. minute," said the resolute Dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck on
24301. the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor, set to
24302. work once more.
24303. 
24304. At that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in her cap
24305. and velvet gown.
24306. 
24307. "Oo-oo, my beauty!" exclaimed the count, "she looks better than any of
24308. you!"
24309. 
24310. He would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside fearing to
24311. be rumpled.
24312. 
24313. "Mamma, your cap, more to this side," said Natasha. "I'll arrange it,"
24314. and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up her skirt
24315. could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn off.
24316. 
24317. "Oh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!"
24318. 
24319. "Never mind, I'll run it up, it won't show," said Dunyasha.
24320. 
24321. "What a beauty--a very queen!" said the nurse as she came to the door.
24322. "And Sonya! They are lovely!"
24323. 
24324. At a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started.
24325. But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.
24326. 
24327. Peronskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she had
24328. gone through the same process as the Rostovs, but with less flurry--for
24329. to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was washed,
24330. perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. She had washed behind her
24331. ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing room in her
24332. yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her old lady's maid
24333. was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostovs' servants had been.
24334. 
24335. She praised the Rostovs' toilets. They praised her taste and toilet, and
24336. at eleven o'clock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they settled
24337. themselves in their carriages and drove off.
24338. 
24339. 
24340. 
24341. 
24342. 
24343. CHAPTER XV
24344. 
24345. 
24346. Natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once
24347. had time to think of what lay before her.
24348. 
24349. In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage, she
24350. for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at
24351. the ball, in those brightly lighted rooms--with music, flowers, dances,
24352. the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg. The
24353. prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true,
24354. so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the
24355. carriage. She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping
24356. over the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her
24357. fur cloak, and, beside Sonya and in front of her mother, mounted the
24358. brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers. Only then did she
24359. remember how she must behave at a ball, and tried to assume the majestic
24360. air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion. But,
24361. fortunately for her, she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw nothing
24362. clearly, her pulse beat a hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed
24363. at her heart. She could not assume that pose, which would have made her
24364. ridiculous, and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying
24365. with all her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that
24366. became her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering,
24367. also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the
24368. landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with
24369. diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.
24370. 
24371. Natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection
24372. from the others. All was blended into one brilliant procession.
24373. On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices, footsteps, and
24374. greetings deafened Natasha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still
24375. more. The host and hostess, who had already been standing at the door
24376. for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals,
24377. "Charme de vous voir," * greeted the Rostovs and Peronskaya in the same
24378. manner.
24379. 
24380. 
24381.     * "Delighted to see you."
24382. 
24383. 
24384. The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her black
24385. hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess' eye involuntarily
24386. rested longer on the slim Natasha. She looked at her and gave her alone
24387. a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess. Looking at
24388. her she may have recalled the golden, irrecoverable days of her own
24389. girlhood and her own first ball. The host also followed Natasha with his
24390. eyes and asked the count which was his daughter.
24391. 
24392. "Charming!" said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.
24393. 
24394. In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting
24395. the Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front rows of
24396. that crowd. Natasha heard and felt that several people were asking about
24397. her and looking at her. She realized that those noticing her liked her,
24398. and this observation helped to calm her.
24399. 
24400. "There are some like ourselves and some worse," she thought.
24401. 
24402. Peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at
24403. the ball.
24404. 
24405. "That is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man," she
24406. said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly hair,
24407. who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said.
24408. 
24409. "Ah, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bezukhova," said
24410. Peronskaya, indicating Helene who had just entered. "How lovely! She
24411. is quite equal to Marya Antonovna. See how the men, young and old, pay
24412. court to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince--is quite mad
24413. about her. But see, those two, though not good-looking, are even more
24414. run after."
24415. 
24416. She pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain
24417. daughter.
24418. 
24419. "She is a splendid match, a millionairess," said Peronskaya. "And look,
24420. here come her suitors."
24421. 
24422. "That is Bezukhova's brother, Anatole Kuragin," she said, indicating a
24423. handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them with head erect,
24424. looking at something over the heads of the ladies. "He's handsome,
24425. isn't he? I hear they will marry him to that rich girl. But your cousin,
24426. Drubetskoy, is also very attentive to her. They say she has millions. Oh
24427. yes, that's the French ambassador himself!" she replied to the countess'
24428. inquiry about Caulaincourt. "Looks as if he were a king! All the same,
24429. the French are charming, very charming. No one more charming in society.
24430. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is still the most beautiful of them all, our
24431. Marya Antonovna! And how simply she is dressed! Lovely! And that stout
24432. one in spectacles is the universal Freemason," she went on, indicating
24433. Pierre. "Put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon!"
24434. 
24435. Pierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the crowd
24436. and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly as if he
24437. were passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through, evidently
24438. looking for someone.
24439. 
24440. Natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, "the buffoon,"
24441. as Peronskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for them, and
24442. for her in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and introduce
24443. partners to her.
24444. 
24445. But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark
24446. man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window
24447. talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Natasha at once
24448. recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it was
24449. Bolkonski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger, happier, and
24450. better-looking.
24451. 
24452. "There's someone else we know--Bolkonski, do you see, Mamma?" said
24453. Natasha, pointing out Prince Andrew. "You remember, he stayed a night
24454. with us at Otradnoe."
24455. 
24456. "Oh, you know him?" said Peronskaya. "I can't bear him. Il fait a
24457. present la pluie et le beau temps. * He's too proud for anything. Takes
24458. after his father. And he's hand in glove with Speranski, writing some
24459. project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies! There's one
24460. talking to him and he has turned away," she said, pointing at him. "I'd
24461. give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies."
24462. 
24463. 
24464.     * "He is all the rage just now."
24465. 
24466. 
24467. 
24468. 
24469. 
24470. CHAPTER XVI
24471. 
24472. 
24473. Suddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward and then
24474. back, and between the two rows, which separated, the Emperor entered to
24475. the sounds of music that had immediately struck up. Behind him walked
24476. his host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing to right and left
24477. as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over. The band
24478. played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that
24479. had been set to it, beginning: "Alexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts you
24480. ravish quite..." The Emperor passed on to the drawing room, the crowd
24481. made a rush for the doors, and several persons with excited faces
24482. hurried there and back again. Then the crowd hastily retired from
24483. the drawing-room door, at which the Emperor reappeared talking to the
24484. hostess. A young man, looking distraught, pounced down on the ladies,
24485. asking them to move aside. Some ladies, with faces betraying complete
24486. forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum, pushed forward to the
24487. detriment of their toilets. The men began to choose partners and take
24488. their places for the polonaise.
24489. 
24490. Everyone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing
24491. room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the
24492. music. The host followed with Marya Antonovna Naryshkina; then came
24493. ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom Peronskaya diligently
24494. named. More than half the ladies already had partners and were taking
24495. up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the polonaise. Natasha
24496. felt that she would be left with her mother and Sonya among a minority
24497. of women who crowded near the wall, not having been invited to dance.
24498. She stood with her slender arms hanging down, her scarcely defined bosom
24499. rising and falling regularly, and with bated breath and glittering,
24500. frightened eyes gazed straight before her, evidently prepared for the
24501. height of joy or misery. She was not concerned about the Emperor or any
24502. of those great people whom Peronskaya was pointing out--she had but one
24503. thought: "Is it possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among
24504. the first to dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will
24505. notice me? They do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as
24506. if they were saying, 'Ah, she's not the one I'm after, so it's not worth
24507. looking at her!' No, it's impossible," she thought. "They must know
24508. how I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would enjoy
24509. dancing with me."
24510. 
24511. The strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable
24512. time, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natasha's ears. She
24513. wanted to cry. Peronskaya had left them. The count was at the other end
24514. of the room. She and the countess and Sonya were standing by themselves
24515. as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers, with no one
24516. interested in them and not wanted by anyone. Prince Andrew with a lady
24517. passed by, evidently not recognizing them. The handsome Anatole was
24518. smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at Natasha as one
24519. looks at a wall. Boris passed them twice and each time turned away. Berg
24520. and his wife, who were not dancing, came up to them.
24521. 
24522. This family gathering seemed humiliating to Natasha--as if there were
24523. nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did not
24524. listen to or look at Vera, who was telling her something about her own
24525. green dress.
24526. 
24527. At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced
24528. with three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the
24529. Rostovs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they
24530. were already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the
24531. distinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The Emperor
24532. looked smilingly down the room. A minute passed but no one had yet begun
24533. dancing. An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess
24534. Bezukhova and asked her to dance. She smilingly raised her hand and laid
24535. it on his shoulder without looking at him. The aide-de-camp, an adept
24536. in his art, grasping his partner firmly round her waist, with confident
24537. deliberation started smoothly, gliding first round the edge of the
24538. circle, then at the corner of the room he caught Helene's left hand
24539. and turned her, the only sound audible, apart from the ever-quickening
24540. music, being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid, agile feet,
24541. while at every third beat his partner's velvet dress spread out and
24542. seemed to flash as she whirled round. Natasha gazed at them and was
24543. ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of
24544. the waltz.
24545. 
24546. Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing
24547. stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the
24548. front row of the circle not far from the Rostovs. Baron Firhoff was
24549. talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State to be
24550. held next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with Speranski
24551. and participating in the work of the legislative commission, could give
24552. reliable information about that sitting, concerning which various rumors
24553. were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was
24554. gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who
24555. had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle.
24556. 
24557. Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor's presence,
24558. and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance.
24559. 
24560. Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.
24561. 
24562. "You always dance. I have a protegee, the young Rostova, here. Ask her,"
24563. he said.
24564. 
24565. "Where is she?" asked Bolkonski. "Excuse me!" he added, turning to the
24566. baron, "we will finish this conversation elsewhere--at a ball one
24567. must dance." He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated. The
24568. despairing, dejected expression of Natasha's face caught his eye.
24569. He recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her debut,
24570. remembered her conversation at the window, and with an expression of
24571. pleasure on his face approached Countess Rostova.
24572. 
24573. "Allow me to introduce you to my daughter," said the countess, with
24574. heightened color.
24575. 
24576. "I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess
24577. remembers me," said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite
24578. belying Peronskaya's remarks about his rudeness, and approaching Natasha
24579. he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his
24580. invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on
24581. Natasha's face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly
24582. brightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.
24583. 
24584. "I have long been waiting for you," that frightened happy little girl
24585. seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as she
24586. raised her hand to Prince Andrew's shoulder. They were the second couple
24587. to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his
24588. day and Natasha danced exquisitely. Her little feet in their white satin
24589. dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently of
24590. herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender bare
24591. arms and neck were not beautiful--compared to Helene's her shoulders
24592. looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But Helene seemed, as it were,
24593. hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned
24594. her person, while Natasha was like a girl exposed for the first time,
24595. who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this
24596. was absolutely necessary.
24597. 
24598. Prince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as
24599. possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed
24600. to him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked,
24601. caused by the Emperor's presence, he danced, and had chosen Natasha
24602. because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first
24603. pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he embraced that
24604. slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling
24605. so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head, and he
24606. felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood
24607. breathing deeply and watching the other dancers.
24608. 
24609. 
24610. 
24611. 
24612. 
24613. CHAPTER XVII
24614. 
24615. 
24616. After Prince Andrew, Boris came up to ask Natasha for a dance, and then
24617. the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several other young men,
24618. so that, flushed and happy, and passing on her superfluous partners to
24619. Sonya, she did not cease dancing all the evening. She noticed and saw
24620. nothing of what occupied everyone else. Not only did she fail to notice
24621. that the Emperor talked a long time with the French ambassador, and how
24622. particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or that Prince So-and-so
24623. and So-and-so did and said this and that, and that Helene had great
24624. success and was honored by the special attention of So-and-so, but she
24625. did not even see the Emperor, and only noticed that he had gone because
24626. the ball became livelier after his departure. For one of the merry
24627. cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner. He
24628. reminded her of their first encounter in the Otradnoe avenue, and how
24629. she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and told her how he
24630. had involuntarily overheard her. Natasha blushed at that recollection
24631. and tried to excuse herself, as if there had been something to be
24632. ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had overheard.
24633. 
24634. Like all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked meeting
24635. someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And such was
24636. Natasha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and even her
24637. mistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved with special care and
24638. tenderness, sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most
24639. unimportant matters; he admired her shy grace. In the middle of the
24640. cotillion, having completed one of the figures, Natasha, still out of
24641. breath, was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her. She was
24642. tired and panting and evidently thought of declining, but immediately
24643. put her hand gaily on the man's shoulder, smiling at Prince Andrew.
24644. 
24645. "I'd be glad to sit beside you and rest: I'm tired; but you see how they
24646. keep asking me, and I'm glad of it, I'm happy and I love everybody, and
24647. you and I understand it all," and much, much more was said in her smile.
24648. When her partner left her Natasha ran across the room to choose two
24649. ladies for the figure.
24650. 
24651. "If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she will be
24652. my wife," said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as he
24653. watched her. She did go first to her cousin.
24654. 
24655. "What rubbish sometimes enters one's head!" thought Prince Andrew, "but
24656. what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original, that she
24657. won't be dancing here a month before she will be married.... Such as
24658. she are rare here," he thought, as Natasha, readjusting a rose that was
24659. slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him.
24660. 
24661. When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to
24662. the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked
24663. his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. Natasha did not answer at
24664. once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: "How can
24665. you ask such a question?"
24666. 
24667. "I have never enjoyed myself so much before!" she said, and Prince
24668. Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
24669. father and instantly dropped again. Natasha was happier than she had
24670. ever been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes
24671. completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of
24672. evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.
24673. 
24674. At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position
24675. his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A
24676. deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared
24677. over his spectacles seeing no one.
24678. 
24679. On her way to supper Natasha passed him.
24680. 
24681. Pierre's gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of him.
24682. She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own
24683. happiness.
24684. 
24685. "How delightful it is, Count!" said she. "Isn't it?"
24686. 
24687. Pierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.
24688. 
24689. "Yes, I am very glad," he said.
24690. 
24691. "How can people be dissatisfied with anything?" thought Natasha.
24692. "Especially such a capital fellow as Bezukhov!" In Natasha's eyes all
24693. the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid people,
24694. loving one another; none of them capable of injuring another--and so
24695. they ought all to be happy.
24696. 
24697. 
24698. 
24699. 
24700. 
24701. CHAPTER XVIII
24702. 
24703. 
24704. Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not dwell
24705. on it long. "Yes, it was a very brilliant ball," and then... "Yes, that
24706. little Rostova is very charming. There's something fresh, original,
24707. un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her." That was all he
24708. thought about yesterday's ball, and after his morning tea he set to
24709. work.
24710. 
24711. But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for work
24712. and could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work, as he
24713. often did, and was glad when he heard someone coming.
24714. 
24715. The visitor was Bitski, who served on various committees, frequented all
24716. the societies in Petersburg, and a passionate devotee of the new ideas
24717. and of Speranski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger--one of those men
24718. who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion,
24719. but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans. Hardly
24720. had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince Andrew's room with a
24721. preoccupied air and at once began talking. He had just heard particulars
24722. of that morning's sitting of the Council of State opened by the Emperor,
24723. and he spoke of it enthusiastically. The Emperor's speech had been
24724. extraordinary. It had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs
24725. deliver. "The Sovereign plainly said that the Council and Senate are
24726. estates of the realm, he said that the government must rest not on
24727. authority but on secure bases. The Emperor said that the fiscal system
24728. must be reorganized and the accounts published," recounted Bitski,
24729. emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly.
24730. 
24731. "Ah, yes! Today's events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our
24732. history," he concluded.
24733. 
24734. Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of
24735. State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached
24736. such importance, and was surprised that this event, now that it had
24737. taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He
24738. listened with quiet irony to Bitski's enthusiastic account of it. A very
24739. simple thought occurred to him: "What does it matter to me or to Bitski
24740. what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that make me
24741. any happier or better?"
24742. 
24743. And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince
24744. Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to dine that
24745. evening at Speranski's, "with only a few friends," as the host had said
24746. when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the intimate home
24747. circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince
24748. Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen Speranski in his domestic
24749. surroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go to it.
24750. 
24751. At the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house Speranski
24752. owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room this small
24753. house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting that of a
24754. monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the friendly
24755. gathering of Speranski's intimate acquaintances already assembled at
24756. five o'clock. There were no ladies present except Speranski's little
24757. daughter (long-faced like her father) and her governess. The other
24758. guests were Gervais, Magnitski, and Stolypin. While still in the
24759. anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato
24760. laugh--a laugh such as one hears on the stage. Someone--it sounded like
24761. Speranski--was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew had never
24762. before heard Speranski's famous laugh, and this ringing, high pitched
24763. laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him.
24764. 
24765. He entered the dining room. The whole company were standing between two
24766. windows at a small table laid with hors-d'oeuvres. Speranski, wearing
24767. a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still
24768. the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of
24769. the Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His
24770. guests surrounded him. Magnitski, addressing himself to Speranski, was
24771. relating an anecdote, and Speranski was laughing in advance at what
24772. Magnitski was going to say. When Prince Andrew entered the room
24773. Magnitski's words were again crowned by laughter. Stolypin gave a deep
24774. bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais laughed
24775. softly with a hissing chuckle, and Speranski in a high-pitched staccato
24776. manner.
24777. 
24778. Still laughing, Speranski held out his soft white hand to Prince Andrew.
24779. 
24780. "Very pleased to see you, Prince," he said. "One moment..." he went on,
24781. turning to Magnitski and interrupting his story. "We have agreed that
24782. this is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about business!" and
24783. turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.
24784. 
24785. Prince Andrew looked at the laughing Speranski with astonishment,
24786. regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not
24787. Speranski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared
24788. mysterious and fascinating in Speranski suddenly became plain and
24789. unattractive.
24790. 
24791. At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to
24792. consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before Magnitski
24793. had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something
24794. still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state
24795. service, related to people in the service. It seemed that in this
24796. company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted
24797. that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored
24798. ridicule. Speranski related how at the Council that morning a deaf
24799. dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so too.
24800. Gervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable for the
24801. stupidity of everybody concerned. Stolypin, stuttering, broke into the
24802. conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed
24803. under the former order of things--threatening to give a serious turn
24804. to the conversation. Magnitski starting quizzing Stolypin about his
24805. vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its
24806. former lively tone.
24807. 
24808. Evidently Speranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement
24809. in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his wish, tried
24810. to enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince
24811. Andrew mirthless and tiresome. Speranski's high-pitched voice struck
24812. him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false
24813. note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper
24814. on the spirits of the company, but no one took any notice of his being
24815. out of harmony with the general mood. They all seemed very gay.
24816. 
24817. He tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were
24818. tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could
24819. not jest with them.
24820. 
24821. There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was witty and
24822. might have been funny, but it lacked just that something which is the
24823. salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a thing existed.
24824. 
24825. After dinner Speranski's daughter and her governess rose. He patted the
24826. little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture, too,
24827. seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.
24828. 
24829. The men remained at table over their port--English fashion. In the midst
24830. of a conversation that was started about Napoleon's Spanish affairs,
24831. which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to express a
24832. contrary opinion. Speranski smiled and, with an evident wish to prevent
24833. the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a story that had
24834. no connection with the previous conversation. For a few moments all were
24835. silent.
24836. 
24837. Having sat some time at table, Speranski corked a bottle of wine and,
24838. remarking, "Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair," passed it
24839. to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly went
24840. into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed to
24841. Speranski and he took them to his study. As soon as he had left the room
24842. the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly
24843. and quietly with one another.
24844. 
24845. "Now for the recitation!" said Speranski on returning from his study. "A
24846. wonderful talent!" he said to Prince Andrew, and Magnitski immediately
24847. assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in French which
24848. he had composed about various well-known Petersburg people. He was
24849. interrupted several times by applause. When the verses were finished
24850. Prince Andrew went up to Speranski and took his leave.
24851. 
24852. "Where are you off to so early?" asked Speranski.
24853. 
24854. "I promised to go to a reception."
24855. 
24856. They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike,
24857. impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have
24858. expected anything from Speranski and from any of his own activities
24859. connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what
24860. Speranski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince
24861. Andrew's ears long after he had left the house.
24862. 
24863. When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in
24864. Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new. He
24865. recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project
24866. of army reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they
24867. were trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor
24868. one, had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor. He thought
24869. of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. He remembered
24870. how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and
24871. procedure was discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and
24872. promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded. He
24873. recalled his labors on the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had
24874. translated the articles of the Roman and French codes into Russian,
24875. and he felt ashamed of himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself
24876. Bogucharovo, his occupations in the country, his journey to Ryazan;
24877. he remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally
24878. applying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he
24879. felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless
24880. work.
24881. 
24882. 
24883. 
24884. 
24885. 
24886. CHAPTER XIX
24887. 
24888. 
24889. Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before,
24890. and among them at the Rostovs' with whom he had renewed acquaintance
24891. at the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the
24892. call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a
24893. pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.
24894. 
24895. Natasha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a dark-blue
24896. house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in her
24897. ball dress. She and all the Rostov family welcomed him as an old friend,
24898. simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he had formerly judged
24899. severely, now seemed to him to consist of excellent, simple, and kindly
24900. people. The old count's hospitality and good nature, which struck one
24901. especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise, were such that Prince
24902. Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner. "Yes," he thought, "they
24903. are capital people, who of course have not the slightest idea what a
24904. treasure they possess in Natasha; but they are kindly folk and form
24905. the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic, charming girl,
24906. overflowing with life!"
24907. 
24908. In Natasha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
24909. alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,
24910. that in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had
24911. already begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no
24912. longer and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered it
24913. found in it a new enjoyment.
24914. 
24915. After dinner Natasha, at Prince Andrew's request, went to the clavichord
24916. and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies
24917. and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and
24918. suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had thought impossible for
24919. him. He looked at Natasha as she sang, and something new and joyful
24920. stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the same time sad. He had
24921. absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep. What about?
24922. His former love? The little princess? His disillusionments?... His hopes
24923. for the future?... Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden, vivid
24924. sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and
24925. illimitable within him and that limited and material something that he,
24926. and even she, was. This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while
24927. she sang.
24928. 
24929. As soon as Natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how he
24930. liked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling that
24931. she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and said he
24932. liked her singing as he liked everything she did.
24933. 
24934. Prince Andrew left the Rostovs' late in the evening. He went to bed from
24935. habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having lit his candle
24936. he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again not at all troubled
24937. by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had
24938. stepped out of a stuffy room into God's own fresh air. It did not enter
24939. his head that he was in love with Natasha; he was not thinking about
24940. her, but only picturing her to himself, and in consequence all life
24941. appeared in a new light. "Why do I strive, why do I toil in this narrow,
24942. confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open to me?"
24943. said he to himself. And for the first time for a very long while he
24944. began making happy plans for the future. He decided that he must attend
24945. to his son's education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his
24946. charge, then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad, and see
24947. England, Switzerland and Italy. "I must use my freedom while I feel so
24948. much strength and youth in me," he said to himself. "Pierre was right
24949. when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order
24950. to be happy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead bury their dead,
24951. but while one has life one must live and be happy!" thought he.
24952. 
24953. 
24954. 
24955. 
24956. 
24957. CHAPTER XX
24958. 
24959. 
24960. One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in
24961. Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an immaculate
24962. brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his
24963. temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.
24964. 
24965. "I have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately she
24966. could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate
24967. with you," he said with a smile.
24968. 
24969. "What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service."
24970. 
24971. "I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count" (Berg said this with
24972. perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable),
24973. "and so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wife's
24974. friends." (He smiled still more pleasantly.) "I wished to ask the
24975. countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper."
24976. 
24977. Only Countess Helene, considering the society of such people as the
24978. Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation.
24979. Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small
24980. but select company, and why this would give him pleasure, and why though
24981. he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared
24982. to run into some expense for the sake of good society--that Pierre could
24983. not refuse, and promised to come.
24984. 
24985. "But don't be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten minutes to
24986. eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is coming. He
24987. is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you will do me the
24988. favor."
24989. 
24990. Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the
24991. Bergs' house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.
24992. 
24993. Having prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were ready
24994. for their guests' arrival.
24995. 
24996. In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and pictures
24997. and new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely buttoned up in
24998. his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always
24999. could and should be acquainted with people above one, because only then
25000. does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.
25001. 
25002. "You can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I
25003. managed from my first promotion." (Berg measured his life not by years
25004. but by promotions.) "My comrades are still nobodies, while I am only
25005. waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to
25006. be your husband." (He rose and kissed Vera's hand, and on the way to
25007. her straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) "And how have I
25008. obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances. It
25009. goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical."
25010. 
25011. Berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and
25012. paused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak
25013. woman who could not understand all that constitutes a man's dignity,
25014. what it was ein Mann zu sein. * Vera at the same time smiling with a
25015. sense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the
25016. same understood life wrongly, as according to Vera all men did. Berg,
25017. judging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. Vera, judging
25018. only by her husband and generalizing from that observation, supposed
25019. that all men, though they understand nothing and are conceited and
25020. selfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone.
25021. 
25022. 
25023.     * To be a man.
25024. 
25025. 
25026. Berg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her lace
25027. fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on the
25028. lips.
25029. 
25030. "The only thing is, we mustn't have children too soon," he continued,
25031. following an unconscious sequence of ideas.
25032. 
25033. "Yes," answered Vera, "I don't at all want that. We must live for
25034. society."
25035. 
25036. "Princess Yusupova wore one exactly like this," said Berg, pointing to
25037. the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.
25038. 
25039. Just then Count Bezukhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced at one
25040. another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally claiming
25041. the honor of this visit.
25042. 
25043. "This is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances," thought Berg.
25044. "This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself."
25045. 
25046. "But please don't interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests," said
25047. Vera, "because I know what interests each of them and what to say to
25048. different people."
25049. 
25050. Berg smiled again.
25051. 
25052. "It can't be helped: men must sometimes have masculine conversation,"
25053. said he.
25054. 
25055. They received Pierre in their small, new drawing-room, where it was
25056. impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry,
25057. neatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that
25058. Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair
25059. or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently painfully
25060. undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor to settle
25061. the question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a
25062. chair for himself, and Berg and Vera immediately began their evening
25063. party, interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their
25064. guest.
25065. 
25066. Vera, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be entertained
25067. with conversation about the French embassy, at once began accordingly.
25068. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation was required,
25069. interrupted his wife's remarks and touched on the question of the war
25070. with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to
25071. personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the
25072. Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them. Though the
25073. conversation was very incoherent and Vera was angry at the intrusion
25074. of the masculine element, both husband and wife felt with satisfaction
25075. that, even if only one guest was present, their evening had begun very
25076. well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its
25077. talk, tea, and lighted candles.
25078. 
25079. Before long Boris, Berg's old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of
25080. condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Vera. After
25081. Boris came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the
25082. Rostovs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other
25083. evening parties. Berg and Vera could not repress their smiles of
25084. satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room,
25085. at the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of dresses, and the
25086. bowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody always has it,
25087. especially so the general, who admired the apartment, patted Berg on the
25088. shoulder, and with parental authority superintended the setting out of
25089. the table for boston. The general sat down by Count Ilya Rostov, who was
25090. next to himself the most important guest. The old people sat with the
25091. old, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea table, on
25092. which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as
25093. the Panins had at their party. Everything was just as it was everywhere
25094. else.
25095. 
25096. 
25097. 
25098. 
25099. 
25100. CHAPTER XXI
25101. 
25102. 
25103. Pierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to boston
25104. with Count Rostov, the general, and the colonel. At the card table he
25105. happened to be directly facing Natasha, and was struck by a curious
25106. change that had come over her since the ball. She was silent, and not
25107. only less pretty than at the ball, but only redeemed from plainness by
25108. her look of gentle indifference to everything around.
25109. 
25110. "What's the matter with her?" thought Pierre, glancing at her. She was
25111. sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without looking
25112. at him, made some reply to Boris who sat down beside her. After playing
25113. out a whole suit and to his partner's delight taking five tricks,
25114. Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the
25115. room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again at Natasha.
25116. 
25117. "What has happened to her?" he asked himself with still greater
25118. surprise.
25119. 
25120. Prince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her with a
25121. look of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was looking up
25122. at him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing. And
25123. the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again
25124. alight in her. She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had
25125. again become what she had been at the ball.
25126. 
25127. Prince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and
25128. youthful expression in his friend's face.
25129. 
25130. Pierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with
25131. his back to Natasha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six
25132. rubbers he watched her and his friend.
25133. 
25134. "Something very important is happening between them," thought Pierre,
25135. and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him
25136. neglect the game.
25137. 
25138. After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing
25139. like that, and Pierre was released. Natasha on one side was talking with
25140. Sonya and Boris, and Vera with a subtle smile was saying something to
25141. Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking whether they
25142. were talking secrets, sat down beside them. Vera, having noticed Prince
25143. Andrew's attentions to Natasha, decided that at a party, a real evening
25144. party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary
25145. and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation
25146. with him about feelings in general and about her sister. With so
25147. intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt
25148. that she had to employ her diplomatic tact.
25149. 
25150. When Pierre went up to them he noticed that Vera was being carried away
25151. by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a
25152. thing that rarely happened with him.
25153. 
25154. "What do you think?" Vera was saying with an arch smile. "You are so
25155. discerning, Prince, and understand people's characters so well at a
25156. glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her
25157. attachments? Could she, like other women" (Vera meant herself), "love a
25158. man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is what I consider
25159. true love. What do you think, Prince?"
25160. 
25161. "I know your sister too little," replied Prince Andrew, with a sarcastic
25162. smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, "to be able to
25163. solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed that the less
25164. attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be," he added,
25165. and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.
25166. 
25167. "Yes, that is true, Prince. In our days," continued Vera--mentioning
25168. "our days" as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing,
25169. imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of
25170. "our days" and that human characteristics change with the times--"in our
25171. days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often
25172. stifles real feeling in her. And it must be confessed that Natalie is
25173. very susceptible." This return to the subject of Natalie caused Prince
25174. Andrew to knit his brows with discomfort: he was about to rise, but Vera
25175. continued with a still more subtle smile:
25176. 
25177. "I think no one has been more courted than she," she went on, "but till
25178. quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you know, Count,"
25179. she said to Pierre, "even our dear cousin Boris, who, between ourselves,
25180. was very far gone in the land of tenderness..." (alluding to a map of
25181. love much in vogue at that time).
25182. 
25183. Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent.
25184. 
25185. "You are friendly with Boris, aren't you?" asked Vera.
25186. 
25187. "Yes, I know him..."
25188. 
25189. "I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natasha?"
25190. 
25191. "Oh, there was childish love?" suddenly asked Prince Andrew, blushing
25192. unexpectedly.
25193. 
25194. "Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le
25195. cousinage est un dangereux voisinage. * Don't you think so?"
25196. 
25197. 
25198.     * "Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood."
25199. 
25200. 
25201. "Oh, undoubtedly!" said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural
25202. liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful
25203. with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these
25204. jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.
25205. 
25206. "Well?" asked Pierre, seeing his friend's strange animation with
25207. surprise, and noticing the glance he turned on Natasha as he rose.
25208. 
25209. "I must... I must have a talk with you," said Prince Andrew. "You know
25210. that pair of women's gloves?" (He referred to the Masonic gloves given
25211. to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he loved.) "I...
25212. but no, I will talk to you later on," and with a strange light in his
25213. eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince Andrew approached
25214. Natasha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how Prince Andrew asked her
25215. something and how she flushed as she replied.
25216. 
25217. But at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he
25218. should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on
25219. the affairs in Spain.
25220. 
25221. Berg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his face.
25222. The party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen.
25223. Everything was similar: the ladies' subtle talk, the cards, the general
25224. raising his voice at the card table, and the samovar and the tea cakes;
25225. only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening
25226. parties he wished to imitate. They had not yet had a loud conversation
25227. among the men and a dispute about something important and clever. Now
25228. the general had begun such a discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.
25229. 
25230. 
25231. 
25232. 
25233. 
25234. CHAPTER XXII
25235. 
25236. 
25237. Next day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with the
25238. Rostovs and spent the rest of the day there.
25239. 
25240. Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came, and
25241. without concealing it he tried to be with Natasha all day. Not only in
25242. the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Natasha, but in the
25243. whole house, there was a feeling of awe at something important that was
25244. bound to happen. The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes
25245. at Prince Andrew when he talked to Natasha and timidly started some
25246. artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way.
25247. Sonya was afraid to leave Natasha and afraid of being in the way when
25248. she was with them. Natasha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when
25249. she remained alone with him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by
25250. his timidity. She felt that he wanted to say something to her but could
25251. not bring himself to do so.
25252. 
25253. In the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to
25254. Natasha and whispered: "Well, what?"
25255. 
25256. "Mamma! For heaven's sake don't ask me anything now! One can't talk
25257. about that," said Natasha.
25258. 
25259. But all the same that night Natasha, now agitated and now frightened,
25260. lay a long time in her mother's bed gazing straight before her. She told
25261. her how he had complimented her, how he told her he was going abroad,
25262. asked her where they were going to spend the summer, and then how he had
25263. asked her about Boris.
25264. 
25265. "But such a... such a... never happened to me before!" she said. "Only I
25266. feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when I'm with him. What
25267. does that mean? Does it mean that it's the real thing? Yes? Mamma, are
25268. you asleep?"
25269. 
25270. "No, my love; I am frightened myself," answered her mother. "Now go!"
25271. 
25272. "All the same I shan't sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy! Mummy!
25273. such a thing never happened to me before," she said, surprised and
25274. alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself. "And could we ever
25275. have thought!..."
25276. 
25277. It seemed to Natasha that even at the time she first saw Prince Andrew
25278. at Otradnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she feared
25279. this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had
25280. then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding
25281. him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.
25282. 
25283. "And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg while
25284. we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that ball.
25285. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this! Already
25286. then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar."
25287. 
25288. "What else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them..." said
25289. her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew had
25290. written in Natasha's album.
25291. 
25292. "Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?"
25293. 
25294. "Don't, Natasha! Pray to God. 'Marriages are made in heaven,'" said her
25295. mother.
25296. 
25297. "Darling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!" cried Natasha, shedding
25298. tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.
25299. 
25300. At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him
25301. of his love for Natasha and his firm resolve to make her his wife.
25302. 
25303. That day Countess Helene had a reception at her house. The French
25304. ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of
25305. late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and
25306. gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and
25307. struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air.
25308. 
25309. Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression
25310. and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of
25311. his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a
25312. gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel
25313. oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity
25314. of all things human came to him oftener than before. At the same time
25315. the feeling he had noticed between his protegee Natasha and Prince
25316. Andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position
25317. and his friend's. He tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife,
25318. and about Natasha and Prince Andrew; and again everything seemed to him
25319. insignificant in comparison with eternity; again the question: for what?
25320. presented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic
25321. labors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward
25322. midnight, after he had left the countess' apartments, he was sitting
25323. upstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction
25324. of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy
25325. with tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.
25326. 
25327. "Ah, it's you!" said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air. "And
25328. I, you see, am hard at it." He pointed to his manuscript book with that
25329. air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at
25330. their work.
25331. 
25332. Prince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life on
25333. his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look,
25334. smiled at him with the egotism of joy.
25335. 
25336. "Well, dear heart," said he, "I wanted to tell you about it yesterday
25337. and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything like it
25338. before. I am in love, my friend!"
25339. 
25340. Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on
25341. the sofa beside Prince Andrew.
25342. 
25343. "With Natasha Rostova, yes?" said he.
25344. 
25345. "Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,
25346. but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and
25347. suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in
25348. the world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I can't live
25349. without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why don't
25350. you speak?"
25351. 
25352. "I? I? What did I tell you?" said Pierre suddenly, rising and beginning
25353. to pace up and down the room. "I always thought it.... That girl is
25354. such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend, I entreat you,
25355. don't philosophize, don't doubt, marry, marry, marry.... And I am sure
25356. there will not be a happier man than you."
25357. 
25358. "But what of her?"
25359. 
25360. "She loves you."
25361. 
25362. "Don't talk rubbish..." said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking into
25363. Pierre's eyes.
25364. 
25365. "She does, I know," Pierre cried fiercely.
25366. 
25367. "But do listen," returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the arm. "Do you
25368. know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to someone."
25369. 
25370. "Well, go on, go on. I am very glad," said Pierre, and his face really
25371. changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince
25372. Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite
25373. a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his
25374. disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind
25375. to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his soul. Now he
25376. boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future, said he could not
25377. sacrifice his own happiness to his father's caprice, and spoke of how he
25378. would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her, or
25379. would do without his consent; then he marveled at the feeling that had
25380. mastered him as at something strange, apart from and independent of
25381. himself.
25382. 
25383. "I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of
25384. such love," said Prince Andrew. "It is not at all the same feeling
25385. that I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into two
25386. halves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the
25387. other half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom and
25388. darkness...."
25389. 
25390. "Darkness and gloom," reiterated Pierre: "yes, yes, I understand that."
25391. 
25392. "I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very
25393. happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake."
25394. 
25395. "Yes, yes," Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched and
25396. sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew's lot appeared to
25397. him, the gloomier seemed his own.
25398. 
25399. 
25400. 
25401. 
25402. 
25403. CHAPTER XXIII
25404. 
25405. 
25406. Prince Andrew needed his father's consent to his marriage, and to obtain
25407. this he started for the country next day.
25408. 
25409. His father received his son's communication with external composure, but
25410. inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his
25411. life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life was already
25412. ending. "If only they would let me end my days as I want to," thought
25413. the old man, "then they might do as they please." With his son, however,
25414. he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and,
25415. adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole matter.
25416. 
25417. In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards
25418. birth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young
25419. as he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress
25420. on this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would
25421. be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. "Fourthly and finally," the
25422. father said, looking ironically at his son, "I beg you to put it off for
25423. a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as you wanted to for a German
25424. tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your love or passion or obstinacy--as
25425. you please--is still as great, marry! And that's my last word on it.
25426. Mind, the last..." concluded the prince, in a tone which showed that
25427. nothing would make him alter his decision.
25428. 
25429. Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or
25430. his fiancee's, would not stand a year's test, or that he (the old
25431. prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to conform to his
25432. father's wish--to propose, and postpone the wedding for a year.
25433. 
25434. Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostovs, Prince
25435. Andrew returned to Petersburg.
25436. 
25437. 
25438. Next day after her talk with her mother Natasha expected Bolkonski all
25439. day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same.
25440. Pierre did not come either and Natasha, not knowing that Prince Andrew
25441. had gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself.
25442. 
25443. Three weeks passed in this way. Natasha had no desire to go out anywhere
25444. and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and listless; she
25445. wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings. She
25446. blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed to her that everybody
25447. knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her.
25448. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound to her vanity intensified her
25449. misery.
25450. 
25451. Once she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began
25452. to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why
25453. it is being punished.
25454. 
25455. The countess began to soothe Natasha, who after first listening to her
25456. mother's words, suddenly interrupted her:
25457. 
25458. "Leave off, Mamma! I don't think, and don't want to think about it! He
25459. just came and then left off, left off..."
25460. 
25461. Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went
25462. on quietly:
25463. 
25464. "And I don't at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I have
25465. now become quite calm, quite calm."
25466. 
25467. The day after this conversation Natasha put on the old dress which
25468. she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the
25469. mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had
25470. abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went to
25471. the ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud resonance, and
25472. began singing her solfeggio. When she had finished her first exercise
25473. she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that
25474. particularly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as though she had not
25475. expected it) to the charm of the notes reverberating, filling the
25476. whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at once she felt
25477. cheerful. "What's the good of making so much of it? Things are nice as
25478. it is," she said to herself, and she began walking up and down the room,
25479. not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each
25480. step from the heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair of
25481. shoes) and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe
25482. as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice. Passing a mirror
25483. she glanced into it. "There, that's me!" the expression of her face
25484. seemed to say as she caught sight of herself. "Well, and very nice too!
25485. I need nobody."
25486. 
25487. A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she
25488. would not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her
25489. walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite mood--love of, and
25490. delight in, herself. "How charming that Natasha is!" she said again,
25491. speaking as some third, collective, male person. "Pretty, a good voice,
25492. young, and in nobody's way if only they leave her in peace." But
25493. however much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace, and
25494. immediately felt this.
25495. 
25496. In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, "At home?" and
25497. then footsteps were heard. Natasha was looking at the mirror, but did
25498. not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw
25499. herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though
25500. she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.
25501. 
25502. Pale and agitated, Natasha ran into the drawing room.
25503. 
25504. "Mamma! Bolkonski has come!" she said. "Mamma, it is awful, it is
25505. unbearable! I don't want... to be tormented? What am I to do?..."
25506. 
25507. Before the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with
25508. an agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Natasha his face
25509. brightened. He kissed the countess' hand and Natasha's, and sat down
25510. beside the sofa.
25511. 
25512. "It is long since we had the pleasure..." began the countess, but Prince
25513. Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question, obviously in
25514. haste to say what he had to.
25515. 
25516. "I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my
25517. father's. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only
25518. got back last night," he said glancing at Natasha; "I want to have a
25519. talk with you, Countess," he added after a moment's pause.
25520. 
25521. The countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.
25522. 
25523. "I am at your disposal," she murmured.
25524. 
25525. Natasha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:
25526. something gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared
25527. straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.
25528. 
25529. "At once? This instant!... No, it can't be!" she thought.
25530. 
25531. Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not
25532. mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be decided.
25533. 
25534. "Go, Natasha! I will call you," said the countess in a whisper.
25535. 
25536. Natasha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at
25537. her mother and went out.
25538. 
25539. "I have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter's hand," said Prince
25540. Andrew.
25541. 
25542. The countess' face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.
25543. 
25544. "Your offer..." she began at last sedately. He remained silent, looking
25545. into her eyes. "Your offer..." (she grew confused) "is agreeable to us,
25546. and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband... I hope... but it
25547. will depend on her...."
25548. 
25549. "I will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it to me?"
25550. said Prince Andrew.
25551. 
25552. "Yes," replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and with a
25553. mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his
25554. forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a
25555. son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. "I am
25556. sure my husband will consent," said the countess, "but your father..."
25557. 
25558. "My father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express
25559. condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a
25560. year. And I wished to tell you of that," said Prince Andrew.
25561. 
25562. "It is true that Natasha is still young, but--so long as that?..."
25563. 
25564. "It is unavoidable," said Prince Andrew with a sigh.
25565. 
25566. "I will send her to you," said the countess, and left the room.
25567. 
25568. "Lord have mercy upon us!" she repeated while seeking her daughter.
25569. 
25570. Sonya said that Natasha was in her bedroom. Natasha was sitting on
25571. the bed, pale and dry eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering
25572. something as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped
25573. up and flew to her.
25574. 
25575. "Well, Mamma?... Well?..."
25576. 
25577. "Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand," said the countess,
25578. coldly it seemed to Natasha. "Go... go," said the mother, sadly and
25579. reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.
25580. 
25581. Natasha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When she came
25582. in and saw him she paused. "Is it possible that this stranger has now
25583. become everything to me?" she asked herself, and immediately answered,
25584. "Yes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than everything in the
25585. world." Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast eyes.
25586. 
25587. "I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?"
25588. 
25589. He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of
25590. her face. Her face said: "Why ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know?
25591. Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?"
25592. 
25593. She drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.
25594. 
25595. "Do you love me?"
25596. 
25597. "Yes, yes!" Natasha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed loudly
25598. and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.
25599. 
25600. "What is it? What's the matter?"
25601. 
25602. "Oh, I am so happy!" she replied, smiled through her tears, bent over
25603. closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she
25604. might, and then kissed him.
25605. 
25606. Prince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find
25607. in his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly
25608. changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of
25609. desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear
25610. at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of
25611. the duty that now bound him to her forever. The present feeling, though
25612. not so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger and more serious.
25613. 
25614. "Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?" asked Prince
25615. Andrew, still looking into her eyes.
25616. 
25617. "Is it possible that I--the 'chit of a girl,' as everybody called me,"
25618. thought Natasha--"is it possible that I am now to be the wife and the
25619. equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father looks up to?
25620. Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no more playing with
25621. life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies a responsibility for
25622. my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he ask me?"
25623. 
25624. "No," she replied, but she had not understood his question.
25625. 
25626. "Forgive me!" he said. "But you are so young, and I have already been
25627. through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know
25628. yourself."
25629. 
25630. Natasha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to take
25631. in the meaning of his words.
25632. 
25633. "Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be," continued Prince
25634. Andrew, "it will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask you to
25635. make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall remain a
25636. secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should you come
25637. to love..." said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.
25638. 
25639. "Why do you say that?" Natasha interrupted him. "You know that from the
25640. very day you first came to Otradnoe I have loved you," she cried, quite
25641. convinced that she spoke the truth.
25642. 
25643. "In a year you will learn to know yourself...."
25644. 
25645. "A whole year!" Natasha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that
25646. the marriage was to be postponed for a year. "But why a year? Why a
25647. year?..."
25648. 
25649. Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay.
25650. Natasha did not hear him.
25651. 
25652. "And can't it be helped?" she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply, but
25653. his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.
25654. 
25655. "It's awful! Oh, it's awful! awful!" Natasha suddenly cried, and again
25656. burst into sobs. "I shall die, waiting a year: it's impossible, it's
25657. awful!" She looked into her lover's face and saw in it a look of
25658. commiseration and perplexity.
25659. 
25660. "No, no! I'll do anything!" she said, suddenly checking her tears. "I am
25661. so happy."
25662. 
25663. The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple
25664. their blessing.
25665. 
25666. From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostovs' as Natasha's
25667. affianced lover.
25668. 
25669. 
25670. 
25671. 
25672. 
25673. CHAPTER XXIV
25674. 
25675. 
25676. No betrothal ceremony took place and Natasha's engagement to Bolkonski
25677. was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said that as he
25678. was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it;
25679. that he had given his word and bound himself forever, but that he did
25680. not wish to bind Natasha and gave her perfect freedom. If after six
25681. months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right to
25682. reject him. Naturally neither Natasha nor her parents wished to hear of
25683. this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came every day to the Rostovs',
25684. but did not behave to Natasha as an affianced lover: he did not use
25685. the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her hand. After
25686. their engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural relations
25687. sprang up between them. It was as if they had not known each other till
25688. now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as
25689. yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves now quite
25690. different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and sincere. At
25691. first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrew;
25692. he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time Natasha trained
25693. the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them all that he only
25694. appeared to be different, but was really just like all of them, and that
25695. she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be. After a few
25696. days they grew accustomed to him, and without restraint in his presence
25697. pursued their usual way of life, in which he took his part. He could
25698. talk about rural economy with the count, fashions with the countess
25699. and Natasha, and about albums and fancywork with Sonya. Sometimes the
25700. household both among themselves and in his presence expressed their
25701. wonder at how it had all happened, and at the evident omens there had
25702. been of it: Prince Andrew's coming to Otradnoe and their coming to
25703. Petersburg, and the likeness between Natasha and Prince Andrew which
25704. her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and Andrew's encounter with
25705. Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents betokening that it had to be.
25706. 
25707. In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always
25708. accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting
25709. together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and
25710. go away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely
25711. spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to
25712. speak of it. Natasha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she
25713. constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his son. Prince
25714. Andrew blushed, as he often did now--Natasha particularly liked it in
25715. him--and said that his son would not live with them.
25716. 
25717. "Why not?" asked Natasha in a frightened tone.
25718. 
25719. "I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides..."
25720. 
25721. "How I should have loved him!" said Natasha, immediately guessing his
25722. thought; "but I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding fault
25723. with us."
25724. 
25725. Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask his
25726. advice about Petya's education or Nicholas' service. The old countess
25727. sighed as she looked at them; Sonya was always getting frightened lest
25728. she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving them
25729. alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew spoke (he
25730. could tell a story very well), Natasha listened to him with pride; when
25731. she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and
25732. scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in perplexity: "What does he
25733. look for in me? He is trying to discover something by looking at me!
25734. What if what he seeks in me is not there?" Sometimes she fell into one
25735. of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and then she particularly
25736. loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed. He seldom laughed, but
25737. when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter, and after
25738. such a laugh she always felt nearer to him. Natasha would have been
25739. completely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her and
25740. drawing near had not terrified her, just as the mere thought of it made
25741. him turn pale and cold.
25742. 
25743. On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with
25744. him Pierre, who had not been to the Rostovs' once since the ball. Pierre
25745. seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the countess,
25746. and Natasha sat down beside a little chess table with Sonya, thereby
25747. inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.
25748. 
25749. "You have known Bezukhov a long time?" he asked. "Do you like him?"
25750. 
25751. "Yes, he's a dear, but very absurd."
25752. 
25753. And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his
25754. absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.
25755. 
25756. "Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known him from
25757. childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie," Prince Andrew
25758. said with sudden seriousness--"I am going away and heaven knows what may
25759. happen. You may cease to... all right, I know I am not to say that. Only
25760. this, then: whatever may happen to you when I am not here..."
25761. 
25762. "What can happen?"
25763. 
25764. "Whatever trouble may come," Prince Andrew continued, "I beg you,
25765. Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for
25766. advice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but he
25767. has a heart of gold."
25768. 
25769. Neither her father, nor her mother, nor Sonya, nor Prince Andrew himself
25770. could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act on
25771. Natasha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day,
25772. dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding
25773. what awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed
25774. her hand for the last time. "Don't go!" she said in a tone that made him
25775. wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long
25776. afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; but for several days she
25777. sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in anything and only saying
25778. now and then, "Oh, why did he go away?"
25779. 
25780. But a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around
25781. her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became
25782. her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a
25783. child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face.
25784. 
25785. 
25786. 
25787. 
25788. 
25789. CHAPTER XXV
25790. 
25791. 
25792. During that year after his son's departure, Prince Nicholas Bolkonski's
25793. health and temper became much worse. He grew still more irritable, and
25794. it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits
25795. of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so
25796. as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible. Princess Mary had
25797. two passions and consequently two joys--her nephew, little Nicholas, and
25798. religion--and these were the favorite subjects of the prince's attacks
25799. and ridicule. Whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the
25800. superstitiousness of old maids, or the petting and spoiling of children.
25801. "You want to make him"--little Nicholas--"into an old maid like
25802. yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew wants a son and not an old maid," he
25803. would say. Or, turning to Mademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in
25804. Princess Mary's presence how she liked our village priests and icons and
25805. would joke about them.
25806. 
25807. He continually hurt Princess Mary's feelings and tormented her, but it
25808. cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame toward her, or
25809. could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust?
25810. And what is justice? The princess never thought of that proud word
25811. "justice." All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear
25812. and simple law--the law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who
25813. lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God. What had she to
25814. do with the justice or injustice of other people? She had to endure and
25815. love, and that she did.
25816. 
25817. During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay,
25818. gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a
25819. long time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said
25820. nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with
25821. his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his
25822. departure they were dissatisfied with one another.
25823. 
25824. Soon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend
25825. Julie Karagina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream)
25826. of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for her
25827. own brother, killed in Turkey.
25828. 
25829. 
25830. Sorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.
25831. 
25832. Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a
25833. special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your
25834. excellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, can--I
25835. will not say comfort us--but save us from despair. Religion alone can
25836. explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what
25837. cause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life--not merely
25838. harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others--are called away
25839. to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a burden
25840. to themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I saw,
25841. and one I shall never forget--that of my dear sister-in-law--left that
25842. impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother
25843. had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged
25844. anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to
25845. die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since
25846. then, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly
25847. why she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression
25848. of the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though
25849. generally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite
25850. love for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically
25851. innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother's duties. As a
25852. young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so
25853. as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince
25854. Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will
25855. there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of
25856. her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
25857. influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at
25858. the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should
25859. then have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and
25860. certain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you
25861. of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not
25862. a single hair of our heads will fall without His will. And His will is
25863. governed only by infinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for
25864. our good.
25865. 
25866. You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my
25867. wish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You will
25868. be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte! The case
25869. is this: my father's health is growing noticeably worse, he cannot stand
25870. any contradiction and is becoming irritable. This irritability is, as
25871. you know, chiefly directed to political questions. He cannot endure
25872. the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the
25873. sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own, the grandson of the
25874. Great Catherine! As you know, I am quite indifferent to politics, but
25875. from my father's remarks and his talks with Michael Ivanovich I know all
25876. that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on
25877. Buonaparte, who only at Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is not
25878. accepted as a great man, still less as Emperor of France. And my father
25879. cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his
25880. political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to
25881. Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way
25882. of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might
25883. derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the
25884. disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will
25885. be decided very shortly.
25886. 
25887. Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrew's
25888. absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late. After
25889. his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits. He has again
25890. become as I used to know him when a child: kind, affectionate, with that
25891. heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has realized, it seems to me,
25892. that life is not over for him. But together with this mental change
25893. he has grown physically much weaker. He has become thinner and more
25894. nervous. I am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad
25895. which the doctors recommended long ago. I hope it will cure him. You
25896. write that in Petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active,
25897. cultivated, and capable of the young men. Forgive my vanity as a
25898. relation, but I never doubted it. The good he has done to everybody
25899. here, from his peasants up to the gentry, is incalculable. On his
25900. arrival in Petersburg he received only his due. I always wonder at the
25901. way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow, especially such false ones as
25902. that you write about--I mean the report of my brother's betrothal to
25903. the little Rostova. I do not think my brother will ever marry again, and
25904. certainly not her; and this is why: first, I know that though he rarely
25905. speaks about the wife he has lost, the grief of that loss has gone too
25906. deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our
25907. little angel a stepmother. Secondly because, as far as I know, that girl
25908. is not the kind of girl who could please Prince Andrew. I do not think
25909. he would choose her for a wife, and frankly I do not wish it. But I am
25910. running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet. Good-by,
25911. my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty care. My dear
25912. friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.

25920. CHAPTER XXVI
25921. 
25922. 
25923. In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter
25924. from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and
25925. surprising news. He informed her of his engagement to Natasha Rostova.
25926. The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender
25927. and confiding affection for his sister. He wrote that he had never loved
25928. as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life
25929. was. He asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his
25930. resolve when he had last visited Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it
25931. to his father. He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her
25932. father to give his consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt
25933. of his displeasure without attaining her object. "Besides," he wrote,
25934. "the matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now. My father
25935. then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months, half of
25936. that period, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever. If the
25937. doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in Russia, but
25938. as it is I have to postpone my return for three months. You know me
25939. and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have been and
25940. always shall be independent; but to go against his will and arouse his
25941. anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time, would
25942. destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him about the same
25943. question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter
25944. and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is
25945. hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months."
25946. 
25947. After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the
25948. letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly:
25949. 
25950. "Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won't be
25951. long--I shall soon set him free."
25952. 
25953. The princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak
25954. and, raising his voice more and more, cried:
25955. 
25956. "Marry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich,
25957. eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell
25958. him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little Nicholas'
25959. stepmother and I'll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He mustn't be
25960. without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more women are wanted
25961. in my house--let him marry and live by himself. Perhaps you will go and
25962. live with him too?" he added, turning to Princess Mary. "Go in heavens
25963. name! Go out into the frost... the frost... the frost!"
25964. 
25965. After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter.
25966. But repressed vexation at his son's poor-spirited behavior found
25967. expression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former pretexts
25968. for irony a fresh one was now added--allusions to stepmothers and
25969. amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
25970. 
25971. "Why shouldn't I marry her?" he asked his daughter. "She'll make a
25972. splendid princess!"
25973. 
25974. And latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary
25975. noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the
25976. Frenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his
25977. letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the
25978. idea.
25979. 
25980. Little Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion were
25981. Princess Mary's joys and consolations; but besides that, since everyone
25982. must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest depths of her
25983. heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation
25984. of her life. This comforting dream and hope were given her by God's
25985. folk--the half-witted and other pilgrims who visited her without the
25986. prince's knowledge. The longer she lived, the more experience and
25987. observation she had of life, the greater was her wonder at the
25988. short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth:
25989. toiling, suffering, struggling, and harming one another, to obtain that
25990. impossible, visionary, sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had loved his
25991. wife, she died, but that was not enough: he wanted to bind his happiness
25992. to another woman. Her father objected to this because he wanted a more
25993. distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew. And they all struggled
25994. and suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls, their
25995. eternal souls, for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an
25996. instant. Not only do we know this ourselves, but Christ, the Son of God,
25997. came down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is
25998. a probation; yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it. "How
25999. is it that no one realizes this?" thought Princess Mary. "No one except
26000. these despised God's folk who, wallet on back, come to me by the back
26001. door, afraid of being seen by the prince, not for fear of ill-usage by
26002. him but for fear of causing him to sin. To leave family, home, and all
26003. the cares of worldly welfare, in order without clinging to anything to
26004. wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name, doing
26005. no one any harm but praying for all--for those who drive one away as
26006. well as for those who protect one: higher than that life and truth there
26007. is no life or truth!"
26008. 
26009. There was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called
26010. Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn
26011. heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her. Once, when in
26012. a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of
26013. her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of
26014. life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to
26015. become a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary
26016. thought about this for a long time, and at last made up her mind that,
26017. strange as it might seem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She disclosed
26018. this thought to no one but to her confessor, Father Akinfi, the monk,
26019. and he approved of her intention. Under guise of a present for the
26020. pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim's complete costume for
26021. herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief.
26022. Often, approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure,
26023. Princess Mary paused, uncertain whether the time had not already come to
26024. put her project into execution.
26025. 
26026. Often, listening to the pilgrims' tales, she was so stimulated by their
26027. simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning,
26028. that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and
26029. running away from home. In imagination she already pictured herself by
26030. Theodosia's side, dressed in coarse rags, walking with a staff, a wallet
26031. on her back, along the dusty road, directing her wanderings from one
26032. saint's shrine to another, free from envy, earthly love, or desire, and
26033. reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing, but
26034. eternal joy and bliss.
26035. 
26036. "I shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to get
26037. used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on till
26038. my legs fail, and I'll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at last
26039. reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow nor
26040. sighing..." thought Princess Mary.
26041. 
26042. But afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko
26043. (Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she
26044. was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.

26055. 
26056. CHAPTER I
26057. 
26058. 
26059. The Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor--idleness--was a
26060. condition of the first man's blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man has
26061. retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not only
26062. because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but because
26063. our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease. An
26064. inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If man could
26065. find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his
26066. duty, he would have found one of the conditions of man's primitive
26067. blessedness. And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness
26068. is the lot of a whole class--the military. The chief attraction of
26069. military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and
26070. irreproachable idleness.
26071. 
26072. Nicholas Rostov experienced this blissful condition to the full when,
26073. after 1807, he continued to serve in the Pavlograd regiment, in which he
26074. already commanded the squadron he had taken over from Denisov.
26075. 
26076. Rostov had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow
26077. acquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked
26078. and respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was well
26079. contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters from home
26080. more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling
26081. into greater and greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come
26082. back to gladden and comfort his old parents.
26083. 
26084. Reading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to
26085. take him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the
26086. entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that
26087. sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with
26088. its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its accounts with
26089. stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society, and with Sonya's
26090. love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully difficult and
26091. complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold, formal letters in
26092. French, beginning: "My dear Mamma," and ending: "Your obedient son,"
26093. which said nothing of when he would return. In 1810 he received letters
26094. from his parents, in which they told him of Natasha's engagement to
26095. Bolkonski, and that the wedding would be in a year's time because
26096. the old prince made difficulties. This letter grieved and mortified
26097. Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that Natasha, for whom he
26098. cared more than for anyone else in the family, should be lost to the
26099. home; and secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted not to
26100. have been there to show that fellow Bolkonski that connection with him
26101. was no such great honor after all, and that if he loved Natasha he
26102. might dispense with permission from his dotard father. For a moment he
26103. hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Natasha
26104. before she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and considerations
26105. about Sonya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas again
26106. put it off. But in the spring of that year, he received a letter from
26107. his mother, written without his father's knowledge, and that letter
26108. persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and take
26109. matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and they
26110. would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted Mitenka
26111. so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage of him
26112. and things were going from bad to worse. "For God's sake, I implore
26113. you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family
26114. wretched," wrote the countess.
26115. 
26116. This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a
26117. matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.
26118. 
26119. The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate
26120. to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his
26121. after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious
26122. gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when
26123. he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrushka
26124. (Denisov's servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who
26125. turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going
26126. home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would
26127. go away without having heard from the staff--and this interested him
26128. extremely--whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the
26129. Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think
26130. that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish
26131. Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostov had betted
26132. he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it
26133. seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish
26134. Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had given
26135. one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place
26136. without him--he knew he must go away from this good, bright world to
26137. somewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week later he
26138. obtained his leave. His hussar comrades--not only those of his own
26139. regiment, but the whole brigade--gave Rostov a dinner to which the
26140. subscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were two
26141. bands and two choirs of singers. Rostov danced the Trepak with Major
26142. Basov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped Rostov; the
26143. soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted "hurrah!"
26144. and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first
26145. post station.
26146. 
26147. During the first half of the journey--from Kremenchug to Kiev--all
26148. Rostov's thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with the
26149. squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his
26150. three roans and Dozhoyveyko, his quartermaster, and to wonder anxiously
26151. how things would be at Otradnoe and what he would find there. Thoughts
26152. of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it--far stronger, as
26153. though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of
26154. attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance. At
26155. the last post station before Otradnoe he gave the driver a three-ruble
26156. tip, and on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of
26157. his home.
26158. 
26159. After the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied
26160. expectation--the feeling that "everything is just the same, so why did I
26161. hurry?"--Nicholas began to settle down in his old home world. His father
26162. and mother were much the same, only a little older. What was new in them
26163. was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there used not to
26164. be, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the bad state of
26165. their affairs. Sonya was nearly twenty; she had stopped growing prettier
26166. and promised nothing more than she was already, but that was enough.
26167. She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas returned, and the
26168. faithful, unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him.
26169. Petya and Natasha surprised Nicholas most. Petya was a big handsome
26170. boy of thirteen, merry, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was
26171. already breaking. As for Natasha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and
26172. laughed whenever he looked at her.
26173. 
26174. "You're not the same at all," he said.
26175. 
26176. "How? Am I uglier?"
26177. 
26178. "On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!" he whispered to her.
26179. 
26180. "Yes, yes, yes!" cried Natasha, joyfully.
26181. 
26182. She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to
26183. Otradnoe and showed him his last letter.
26184. 
26185. "Well, are you glad?" Natasha asked. "I am so tranquil and happy now."
26186. 
26187. "Very glad," answered Nicholas. "He is an excellent fellow.... And are
26188. you very much in love?"
26189. 
26190. "How shall I put it?" replied Natasha. "I was in love with Boris, with
26191. my teacher, and with Denisov, but this is quite different. I feel at
26192. peace and settled. I know that no better man than he exists, and I am
26193. calm and contented now. Not at all as before."
26194. 
26195. Nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage
26196. for a year; but Natasha attacked her brother with exasperation, proving
26197. to him that it could not be otherwise, and that it would be a bad thing
26198. to enter a family against the father's will, and that she herself wished
26199. it so.
26200. 
26201. "You don't at all understand," she said.
26202. 
26203. Nicholas was silent and agreed with her.
26204. 
26205. Her brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem at
26206. all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband. She was
26207. even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This amazed
26208. Nicholas and even made him regard Bolkonski's courtship skeptically.
26209. He could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially as he had
26210. not seen her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him that there was
26211. something not quite right about this intended marriage.
26212. 
26213. "Why this delay? Why no betrothal?" he thought. Once, when he had
26214. touched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his surprise
26215. and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her soul she too
26216. had doubts about this marriage.
26217. 
26218. "You see he writes," said she, showing her son a letter of Prince
26219. Andrew's, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to
26220. a daughter's future married happiness, "he writes that he won't come
26221. before December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health
26222. is very delicate. Don't tell Natasha. And don't attach importance to her
26223. being so bright: that's because she's living through the last days of
26224. her girlhood, but I know what she is like every time we receive a letter
26225. from him! However, God grant that everything turns out well!" (She
26226. always ended with these words.) "He is an excellent man!"
26227. 
26228. 
26229. 
26230. 
26231. 
26232. CHAPTER II
26233. 
26234. 
26235. After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull. He was
26236. worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business
26237. matters for which his mother had called him home. To throw off this
26238. burden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his arrival he
26239. went, angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he
26240. was going, to Mitenka's lodge and demanded an account of everything. But
26241. what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew even less than the
26242. frightened and bewildered Mitenka. The conversation and the examination
26243. of the accounts with Mitenka did not last long. The village elder,
26244. a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were waiting in the
26245. passage, heard with fear and delight first the young count's voice
26246. roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and then words of
26247. abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.
26248. 
26249. "Robber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I'll hack the dog to pieces! I'm not
26250. my father!... Robbing us!..." and so on.
26251. 
26252. Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in
26253. the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mitenka out by the scruff of
26254. the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility
26255. at convenient moments between the words, shouting, "Be off! Never let me
26256. see your face here again, you villain!"
26257. 
26258. Mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
26259. shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for culprits
26260. at Otradnoe. Mitenka himself, returning tipsy from the town, used to
26261. hide there, and many of the residents at Otradnoe, hiding from Mitenka,
26262. knew of its protective qualities.)
26263. 
26264. Mitenka's wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and frightened
26265. faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and
26266. where the steward's high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt.
26267. 
26268. The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by
26269. with resolute strides and went into the house.
26270. 
26271. The countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the
26272. lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly
26273. improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this
26274. excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his door on
26275. tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.
26276. 
26277. Next day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed
26278. smile, said to him:
26279. 
26280. "But you know, my dear boy, it's a pity you got excited! Mitenka has
26281. told me all about it."
26282. 
26283. "I knew," thought Nicholas, "that I should never understand anything in
26284. this crazy world."
26285. 
26286. "You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they were
26287. carried forward--and you did not look at the other page."
26288. 
26289. "Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have
26290. done, I have done; but, if you like, I won't speak to him again."
26291. 
26292. "No, my dear boy" (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he had
26293. mismanaged his wife's property and was to blame toward his children,
26294. but he did not know how to remedy it). "No, I beg you to attend to the
26295. business. I am old. I..."
26296. 
26297. "No, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I understand
26298. it all less than you do."
26299. 
26300. "Devil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings forward
26301. from page to page," he thought. "I used to understand what a 'corner'
26302. and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to another page I
26303. don't understand at all," said he to himself, and after that he did not
26304. meddle in business affairs. But once the countess called her son and
26305. informed him that she had a promissory note from Anna Mikhaylovna for
26306. two thousand rubles, and asked him what he thought of doing with it.
26307. 
26308. "This," answered Nicholas. "You say it rests with me. Well, I don't like
26309. Anna Mikhaylovna and I don't like Boris, but they were our friends and
26310. poor. Well then, this!" and he tore up the note, and by so doing caused
26311. the old countess to weep tears of joy. After that, young Rostov took
26312. no further part in any business affairs, but devoted himself with
26313. passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuit--the chase--for
26314. which his father kept a large establishment.
26315. 
26316. 
26317. 
26318. 
26319. 
26320. CHAPTER III
26321. 
26322. 
26323. The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed
26324. an earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had thickened and its
26325. bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye
26326. trodden down by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of the
26327. spring buckwheat. The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of
26328. August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had
26329. become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The
26330. hares had already half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were
26331. beginning to scatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was
26332. the best time of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young
26333. sportsman Rostov had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were
26334. so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them
26335. a three days' rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go on
26336. a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was an
26337. undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.
26338. 
26339. All that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the air was
26340. sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw.
26341. On the fifteenth, when young Rostov, in his dressing gown, looked out of
26342. the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it was
26343. as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind.
26344. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping, microscopic
26345. particles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with
26346. transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in
26347. the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed
26348. and at a short distance merged into the dull, moist veil of mist.
26349. Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell of
26350. decaying leaves and of dog. Milka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched bitch
26351. with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, stretched her
26352. hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly jumped up and licked
26353. him right on his nose and mustache. Another borzoi, a dog, catching
26354. sight of his master from the garden path, arched his back and, rushing
26355. headlong toward the porch with lifted tail, began rubbing himself
26356. against his legs.
26357. 
26358. "O-hoy!" came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman's call which
26359. unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round the corner
26360. came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray, wrinkled old
26361. man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian fashion, a
26362. long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence and scorn of
26363. everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his Circassian cap
26364. to his master and looked at him scornfully. This scorn was not offensive
26365. to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel, disdainful of everybody
26366. and who considered himself above them, was all the same his serf and
26367. huntsman.
26368. 
26369. "Daniel!" Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the weather,
26370. the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that
26371. irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous
26372. resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress.
26373. 
26374. "What orders, your excellency?" said the huntsman in his deep bass, deep
26375. as a proto-deacon's and hoarse with hallooing--and two flashing black
26376. eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent. "Can you
26377. resist it?" those eyes seemed to be asking.
26378. 
26379. "It's a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?" asked Nicholas,
26380. scratching Milka behind the ears.
26381. 
26382. Daniel did not answer, but winked instead.
26383. 
26384. "I sent Uvarka at dawn to listen," his bass boomed out after a minute's
26385. pause. "He says she's moved them into the Otradnoe enclosure. They were
26386. howling there." (This meant that the she-wolf, about whom they both
26387. knew, had moved with her cubs to the Otradnoe copse, a small place a
26388. mile and a half from the house.)
26389. 
26390. "We ought to go, don't you think so?" said Nicholas. "Come to me with
26391. Uvarka."
26392. 
26393. "As you please."
26394. 
26395. "Then put off feeding them."
26396. 
26397. "Yes, sir."
26398. 
26399. Five minutes later Daniel and Uvarka were standing in Nicholas' big
26400. study. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was
26401. like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and
26402. surroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual stood
26403. just inside the door, trying to speak softly and not move, for fear of
26404. breaking something in the master's apartment, and he hastened to say all
26405. that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling, out into the
26406. open under the sky once more.
26407. 
26408. Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that
26409. the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting), Nicholas
26410. ordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was about to
26411. go Natasha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her hair or
26412. finished dressing and with her old nurse's big shawl wrapped round her.
26413. Petya ran in at the same time.
26414. 
26415. "You are going?" asked Natasha. "I knew you would! Sonya said you
26416. wouldn't go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you couldn't
26417. help going."
26418. 
26419. "Yes, we are going," replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as he
26420. intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Natasha and Petya.
26421. "We are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for you."
26422. 
26423. "You know it is my greatest pleasure," said Natasha. "It's not fair; you
26424. are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said nothing to
26425. us about it."
26426. 
26427. "'No barrier bars a Russian's path'--we'll go!" shouted Petya.
26428. 
26429. "But you can't. Mamma said you mustn't," said Nicholas to Natasha.
26430. 
26431. "Yes, I'll go. I shall certainly go," said Natasha decisively. "Daniel,
26432. tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my dogs," she
26433. added to the huntsman.
26434. 
26435. It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but to
26436. have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible. He
26437. cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business,
26438. careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young
26439. lady.
26440. 
26441. 
26442. 
26443. 
26444. 
26445. CHAPTER IV
26446. 
26447. 
26448. The old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment
26449. but had now handed it all completely over to his son's care, being in
26450. very good spirits on this fifteenth of September, prepared to go out
26451. with the others.
26452. 
26453. In an hour's time the whole hunting party was at the porch. Nicholas,
26454. with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for
26455. attending to trifles, went past Natasha and Petya who were trying to
26456. tell him something. He had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent
26457. a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry, mounted his
26458. chestnut Donets, and whistling to his own leash of borzois, set off
26459. across the threshing ground to a field leading to the Otradnoe wood.
26460. The old count's horse, a sorrel gelding called Viflyanka, was led by the
26461. groom in attendance on him, while the count himself was to drive in a
26462. small trap straight to a spot reserved for him.
26463. 
26464. They were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and
26465. whippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen
26466. and more than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash
26467. belonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and
26468. thirty dogs and twenty horsemen.
26469. 
26470. Each dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his
26471. business, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the
26472. fence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk,
26473. along the road and field leading to the Otradnoe covert.
26474. 
26475. The horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and then
26476. splashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky still
26477. seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the air
26478. was still, warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman,
26479. the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a straggling
26480. hound could be heard.
26481. 
26482. When they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders with
26483. dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the Rostovs. In front rode a
26484. fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.
26485. 
26486. "Good morning, Uncle!" said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.
26487. 
26488. "That's it. Come on!... I was sure of it," began "Uncle." (He was
26489. a distant relative of the Rostovs', a man of small means, and their
26490. neighbor.) "I knew you wouldn't be able to resist it and it's a good
26491. thing you're going. That's it! Come on!" (This was "Uncle's" favorite
26492. expression.) "Take the covert at once, for my Girchik says the Ilagins
26493. are at Korniki with their hounds. That's it. Come on!... They'll take
26494. the cubs from under your very nose."
26495. 
26496. "That's where I'm going. Shall we join up our packs?" asked Nicholas.
26497. 
26498. The hounds were joined into one pack, and "Uncle" and Nicholas rode on
26499. side by side. Natasha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager
26500. face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed by Petya
26501. who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and by a groom
26502. appointed to look after her. Petya, who was laughing, whipped and pulled
26503. at his horse. Natasha sat easily and confidently on her black Arabchik
26504. and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.
26505. 
26506. "Uncle" looked round disapprovingly at Petya and Natasha. He did not
26507. like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.
26508. 
26509. "Good morning, Uncle! We are going too!" shouted Petya.
26510. 
26511. "Good morning, good morning! But don't go overriding the hounds," said
26512. "Uncle" sternly.
26513. 
26514. "Nicholas, what a fine dog Trunila is! He knew me," said Natasha,
26515. referring to her favorite hound.
26516. 
26517. "In the first place, Trunila is not a 'dog,' but a harrier," thought
26518. Nicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her feel the
26519. distance that ought to separate them at that moment. Natasha understood
26520. it.
26521. 
26522. "You mustn't think we'll be in anyone's way, Uncle," she said. "We'll go
26523. to our places and won't budge."
26524. 
26525. "A good thing too, little countess," said "Uncle," "only mind you don't
26526. fall off your horse," he added, "because--that's it, come on!--you've
26527. nothing to hold on to."
26528. 
26529. The oasis of the Otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off,
26530. the huntsmen were already nearing it. Rostov, having finally settled
26531. with "Uncle" where they should set on the hounds, and having shown
26532. Natasha where she was to stand--a spot where nothing could possibly run
26533. out--went round above the ravine.
26534. 
26535. "Well, nephew, you're going for a big wolf," said "Uncle." "Mind and
26536. don't let her slip!"
26537. 
26538. "That's as may happen," answered Rostov. "Karay, here!" he shouted,
26539. answering "Uncle's" remark by this call to his borzoi. Karay was a
26540. shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having tackled a big wolf
26541. unaided. They all took up their places.
26542. 
26543. The old count, knowing his son's ardor in the hunt, hurried so as not
26544. to be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count
26545. Ilya Rostov, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove up
26546. with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him,
26547. where a wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and fastened
26548. on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek, well-fed,
26549. and comfortable horse, Viflyanka, which was turning gray, like himself.
26550. His horses and trap were sent home. Count Ilya Rostov, though not at
26551. heart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well, and rode to
26552. the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged his reins,
26553. settled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was ready, looked
26554. about with a smile.
26555. 
26556. Beside him was Simon Chekmar, his personal attendant, an old horseman
26557. now somewhat stiff in the saddle. Chekmar held in leash three formidable
26558. wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master and his horse.
26559. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred paces farther along
26560. the edge of the wood stood Mitka, the count's other groom, a daring
26561. horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the hunt, by old custom, the
26562. count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken a snack, and
26563. washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux.
26564. 
26565. He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were
26566. rather moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his saddle,
26567. wrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out for an
26568. outing.
26569. 
26570. The thin, hollow-cheeked Chekmar, having got everything ready, kept
26571. glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for
26572. thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant
26573. chat. A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood (it was
26574. plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind the count. This
26575. person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman's cloak, with a tall
26576. peaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who went by a woman's name,
26577. Nastasya Ivanovna.
26578. 
26579. "Well, Nastasya Ivanovna!" whispered the count, winking at him. "If you
26580. scare away the beast, Daniel'll give it you!"
26581. 
26582. "I know a thing or two myself!" said Nastasya Ivanovna.
26583. 
26584. "Hush!" whispered the count and turned to Simon. "Have you seen the
26585. young countess?" he asked. "Where is she?"
26586. 
26587. "With young Count Peter, by the Zharov rank grass," answered Simon,
26588. smiling. "Though she's a lady, she's very fond of hunting."
26589. 
26590. "And you're surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?" said the count.
26591. "She's as good as many a man!"
26592. 
26593. "Of course! It's marvelous. So bold, so easy!"
26594. 
26595. "And Nicholas? Where is he? By the Lyadov upland, isn't he?"
26596. 
26597. "Yes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so well
26598. that Daniel and I are often quite astounded," said Simon, well knowing
26599. what would please his master.
26600. 
26601. "Rides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?"
26602. 
26603. "A perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the
26604. Zavarzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight
26605. when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand rubles
26606. and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search far to
26607. find another as smart."
26608. 
26609. "To search far..." repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not
26610. said more. "To search far," he said, turning back the skirt of his coat
26611. to get at his snuffbox.
26612. 
26613. "The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael
26614. Sidorych..." Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had
26615. distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds
26616. giving tongue. He bent down his head and listened, shaking a warning
26617. finger at his master. "They are on the scent of the cubs..." he
26618. whispered, "straight to the Lyadov uplands."
26619. 
26620. The count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked into
26621. the distance straight before him, down the narrow open space, holding
26622. the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry of the hounds
26623. came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel's hunting horn; the
26624. pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry,
26625. with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after
26626. a wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the
26627. cry of ulyulyu, and above the others rose Daniel's voice, now a deep
26628. bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and
26629. carried far beyond out into the open field.
26630. 
26631. After listening a few moments in silence, the count and his attendant
26632. convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs: the
26633. sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in
26634. the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and it
26635. was with this that Daniel's voice was heard calling ulyulyu. The sounds
26636. of both packs mingled and broke apart again, but both were becoming more
26637. distant.
26638. 
26639. Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had
26640. entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand,
26641. opened it and took a pinch. "Back!" cried Simon to a borzoi that was
26642. pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and dropped the
26643. snuffbox. Nastasya Ivanovna dismounted to pick it up. The count and
26644. Simon were looking at him.
26645. 
26646. Then, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly
26647. approached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were just
26648. in front of them.
26649. 
26650. The count turned and saw on his right Mitka staring at him with eyes
26651. starting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to the
26652. other side.
26653. 
26654. "Look out!" he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had long
26655. fretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he galloped
26656. toward the count.
26657. 
26658. The count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a
26659. wolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet
26660. lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing.
26661. The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the
26662. horses' feet at the wolf.
26663. 
26664. The wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly,
26665. like a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly swaying
26666. from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail
26667. disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry
26668. like a wail, first one hound, then another, and then another, sprang
26669. helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across
26670. the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel
26671. bushes parted behind the hounds and Daniel's chestnut horse appeared,
26672. dark with sweat. On its long back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless,
26673. his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face.
26674. 
26675. "Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!..." he cried. When he caught sight of the count
26676. his eyes flashed lightning.
26677. 
26678. "Blast you!" he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the count.
26679. 
26680. "You've let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!" and as if scorning to
26681. say more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving
26682. flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count
26683. had aroused and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a punished
26684. schoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win Simon's sympathy for
26685. his plight. But Simon was no longer there. He was galloping round by the
26686. bushes while the field was coming up on both sides, all trying to head
26687. the wolf, but it vanished into the wood before they could do so.
26688. 
26689. 
26690. 
26691. 
26692. 
26693. CHAPTER V
26694. 
26695. 
26696. Nicholas Rostov meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the wolf. By
26697. the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of the dogs
26698. whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen
26699. approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was happening at the
26700. copse. He knew that young and old wolves were there, that the hounds had
26701. separated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and
26702. that something had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any
26703. moment. He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and
26704. from what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope
26705. alternated with despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God
26706. that the wolf should come his way. He prayed with that passionate and
26707. shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement
26708. arising from trivial causes. "What would it be to Thee to do this for
26709. me?" he said to God. "I know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to ask
26710. this of Thee, but for God's sake do let the old wolf come my way and
26711. let Karay spring at it--in sight of 'Uncle' who is watching from over
26712. there--and seize it by the throat in a death grip!" A thousand times
26713. during that half-hour Rostov cast eager and restless glances over the
26714. edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen
26715. undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side and "Uncle's" cap
26716. just visible above the bush on his right.
26717. 
26718. "No, I shan't have such luck," thought Rostov, "yet what wouldn't it
26719. be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in war, I am always
26720. unlucky." Memories of Austerlitz and of Dolokhov flashed rapidly and
26721. clearly through his mind. "Only once in my life to get an old wolf, I
26722. want only that!" thought he, straining eyes and ears and looking to the
26723. left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of
26724. note in the cries of the dogs.
26725. 
26726. Again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across
26727. the deserted field. "No, it can't be!" thought Rostov, taking a deep
26728. breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for. The
26729. height of happiness was reached--and so simply, without warning, or
26730. noise, or display, that Rostov could not believe his eyes and remained
26731. in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over
26732. a gully that lay in her path. She was an old animal with a gray back and
26733. big reddish belly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that
26734. no one saw her. Rostov, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois.
26735. They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation.
26736. Old Karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas,
26737. baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs.
26738. 
26739. "Ulyulyulyu!" whispered Rostov, pouting his lips. The borzois jumped up,
26740. jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears. Karay finished
26741. scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got up with quivering
26742. tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.
26743. 
26744. "Shall I loose them or not?" Nicholas asked himself as the wolf
26745. approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf's whole
26746. physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never
26747. seen before--human eyes fixed upon her--and turning her head a little
26748. toward Rostov, she paused.
26749. 
26750. "Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward..." the wolf seemed to say to
26751. herself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a
26752. quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.
26753. 
26754. "Ulyulyu!" cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own accord
26755. his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies to head
26756. off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still. Nicholas
26757. did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor see the
26758. borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only the wolf, who,
26759. increasing her speed, bounded on in the same direction along the hollow.
26760. The first to come into view was Milka, with her black markings and
26761. powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and nearer... now she
26762. was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its head to face her, and instead
26763. of putting on speed as she usually did Milka suddenly raised her tail
26764. and stiffened her forelegs.
26765. 
26766. "Ulyulyulyulyu!" shouted Nicholas.
26767. 
26768. The reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind Milka, sprang impetuously
26769. at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but immediately jumped
26770. aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her teeth, and again rose
26771. and bounded forward, followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all
26772. the borzois, who did not get any closer to her.
26773. 
26774. "She'll get away! No, it's impossible!" thought Nicholas, still shouting
26775. with a hoarse voice.
26776. 
26777. "Karay, ulyulyu!..." he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi who
26778. was now his only hope. Karay, with all the strength age had left him,
26779. stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped heavily
26780. aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolf's lope and the
26781. borzoi's slower pace made it plain that Karay had miscalculated.
26782. Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the
26783. wolf would certainly escape should she reach it. But, coming toward
26784. him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf.
26785. There was still hope. A long, yellowish young borzoi, one Nicholas did
26786. not know, from another leash, rushed impetuously at the wolf from in
26787. front and almost knocked her over. But the wolf jumped up more quickly
26788. than anyone could have expected and, gnashing her teeth, flew at the
26789. yellowish borzoi, which, with a piercing yelp, fell with its head on the
26790. ground, bleeding from a gash in its side.
26791. 
26792. "Karay? Old fellow!..." wailed Nicholas.
26793. 
26794. Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf's path, the old
26795. dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of
26796. it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on Karay, tucked
26797. her tail yet further between her legs, and increased her speed. But
26798. here Nicholas only saw that something happened to Karay--the borzoi was
26799. suddenly on the wolf, and they rolled together down into a gully just in
26800. front of them.
26801. 
26802. That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully
26803. with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and
26804. outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears
26805. laid back (Karay was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest moment
26806. of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to dismount
26807. and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that
26808. mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully. She
26809. clicked her teeth (Karay no longer had her by the throat), leaped with
26810. a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and having disengaged
26811. herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again, went forward. Karay,
26812. his hair bristling, and probably bruised or wounded, climbed with
26813. difficulty out of the gully.
26814. 
26815. "Oh my God! Why?" Nicholas cried in despair.
26816. 
26817. "Uncle's" huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolf's
26818. path and his borzois once more stopped the animal's advance. She was
26819. again hemmed in.
26820. 
26821. Nicholas and his attendant, with "Uncle" and his huntsman, were all
26822. riding round the wolf, crying "ulyulyu!" shouting and preparing to
26823. dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward
26824. again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she
26825. would be safe.
26826. 
26827. Already, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the ulyulyuing,
26828. had rushed out from the wood. He saw Karay seize the wolf, and checked
26829. his horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he saw that the
26830. horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for
26831. safety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf but straight
26832. toward the wood, just as Karay had run to cut the animal off. As a
26833. result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been
26834. stopped a second time by "Uncle's" borzois.
26835. 
26836. Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and
26837. thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if
26838. it were a flail.
26839. 
26840. Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, breathing
26841. heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel
26842. lying on the wolf's back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the
26843. ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself
26844. that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and
26845. tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took
26846. a step, and with his whole weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on
26847. the wolf, seizing her by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but
26848. Daniel whispered, "Don't! We'll gag her!" and, changing his position,
26849. set his foot on the wolf's neck. A stick was thrust between her jaws
26850. and she was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her legs were bound
26851. together, and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side.
26852. 
26853. With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying
26854. and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her
26855. to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had killed two of
26856. the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled with their booty
26857. and their stories, and all came to look at the wolf, which, with her
26858. broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws,
26859. gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding
26860. her. When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly
26861. yet simply at everybody. Old Count Rostov also rode up and touched the
26862. wolf.
26863. 
26864. "Oh, what a formidable one!" said he. "A formidable one, eh?" he asked
26865. Daniel, who was standing near.
26866. 
26867. "Yes, your excellency," answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.
26868. 
26869. The count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with
26870. Daniel.
26871. 
26872. "Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!" said the count.
26873. 
26874. For sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable
26875. smile.
26876. 
26877. 
26878. 
26879. 
26880. 
26881. CHAPTER VI
26882. 
26883. 
26884. The old count went home, and Natasha and Petya promised to return very
26885. soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday
26886. they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees.
26887. Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips.
26888. 
26889. Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone
26890. in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed
26891. before Nicholas heard one he knew, Voltorn, giving tongue at intervals;
26892. other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving tongue. A
26893. moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been
26894. found, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine
26895. toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas.
26896. 
26897. He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the
26898. ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself
26899. at any moment on the ryefield opposite.
26900. 
26901. The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and
26902. Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard
26903. across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close
26904. to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper
26905. curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed
26906. in followed by a black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois
26907. formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with
26908. tails turned away from the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up
26909. to the dogs; one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat.
26910. 
26911. "What's this?" thought Nicholas. "Where's that huntsman from? He is not
26912. 'Uncle's' man."
26913. 
26914. The huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without strapping
26915. it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high saddles, stood
26916. near them and there too the dogs were lying. The huntsmen waved their
26917. arms and did something to the fox. Then from that spot came the sound of
26918. a horn, with the signal agreed on in case of a fight.
26919. 
26920. "That's Ilagin's huntsman having a row with our Ivan," said Nicholas'
26921. groom.
26922. 
26923. Nicholas sent the man to call Natasha and Petya to him, and rode at a
26924. footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together.
26925. Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on.
26926. 
26927. Nicholas dismounted, and with Natasha and Petya, who had ridden up,
26928. stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would end. Out of
26929. the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward
26930. his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper. While still at a
26931. distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully, but he was
26932. pale and breathless and his face was angry. One of his eyes was black,
26933. but he probably was not even aware of it.
26934. 
26935. "What has happened?" asked Nicholas.
26936. 
26937. "A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my gray
26938. bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the fox! I
26939. gave him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste
26940. of this?..." said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and probably
26941. imagining himself still speaking to his foe.
26942. 
26943. Nicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and Petya to
26944. wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy's, Ilagin's, hunting
26945. party was.
26946. 
26947. The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there,
26948. surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.
26949. 
26950. The facts were that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs had a quarrel and were
26951. at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the Rostovs, and
26952. had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very woods the Rostovs
26953. were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased.
26954. 
26955. Nicholas, though he had never seen Ilagin, with his usual absence
26956. of moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his
26957. arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He
26958. rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully
26959. prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his
26960. enemy.
26961. 
26962. Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in
26963. a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse,
26964. accompanied by two hunt servants.
26965. 
26966. Instead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ilagin a stately and courteous
26967. gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count's
26968. acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Ilagin raised his beaver
26969. cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man
26970. punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone else's
26971. borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited
26972. him to draw his covert.
26973. 
26974. Natasha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had
26975. followed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly
26976. greetings, she rode up to them. Ilagin lifted his beaver cap still
26977. higher to Natasha and said, with a pleasant smile, that the young
26978. countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her
26979. beauty, of which he had heard much.
26980. 
26981. To expiate his huntsman's offense, Ilagin pressed the Rostovs to come to
26982. an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and
26983. which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and the hunt, now
26984. doubled, moved on.
26985. 
26986. The way to Iligin's upland was across the fields. The hunt servants fell
26987. into line. The masters rode together. "Uncle," Rostov, and Ilagin kept
26988. stealthily glancing at one another's dogs, trying not to be observed by
26989. their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois.
26990. 
26991. Rostov was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred,
26992. red-spotted bitch on Ilagin's leash, slender but with muscles like
26993. steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of the
26994. swiftness of Ilagin's borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival
26995. to his own Milka.
26996. 
26997. In the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilagin about the year's
26998. harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.
26999. 
27000. "A fine little bitch, that!" said he in a careless tone. "Is she swift?"
27001. 
27002. "That one? Yes, she's a good dog, gets what she's after," answered
27003. Ilagin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erza, for which, a year
27004. before, he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs. "So in
27005. your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of, Count?" he went on,
27006. continuing the conversation they had begun. And considering it polite
27007. to return the young count's compliment, Ilagin looked at his borzois
27008. and picked out Milka who attracted his attention by her breadth. "That
27009. black-spotted one of yours is fine--well shaped!" said he.
27010. 
27011. "Yes, she's fast enough," replied Nicholas, and thought: "If only a
27012. full-grown hare would cross the field now I'd show you what sort of
27013. borzoi she is," and turning to his groom, he said he would give a ruble
27014. to anyone who found a hare.
27015. 
27016. "I don't understand," continued Ilagin, "how some sportsmen can be so
27017. jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count, I enjoy
27018. riding in company such as this... what could be better?" (he again
27019. raised his cap to Natasha) "but as for counting skins and what one
27020. takes, I don't care about that."
27021. 
27022. "Of course not!"
27023. 
27024. "Or being upset because someone else's borzoi and not mine catches
27025. something. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not so,
27026. Count? For I consider that..."
27027. 
27028. "A-tu!" came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in, who
27029. had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip aloft,
27030. and again repeated his long-drawn cry, "A-tu!" (This call and the
27031. uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)
27032. 
27033. "Ah, he has found one, I think," said Ilagin carelessly. "Yes, we must
27034. ride up.... Shall we both course it?" answered Nicholas, seeing in Erza
27035. and "Uncle's" red Rugay two rivals he had never yet had a chance of
27036. pitting against his own borzois. "And suppose they outdo my Milka at
27037. once!" he thought as he rode with "Uncle" and Ilagin toward the hare.
27038. 
27039. "A full-grown one?" asked Ilagin as he approached the whip who had
27040. sighted the hare--and not without agitation he looked round and whistled
27041. to Erza.
27042. 
27043. "And you, Michael Nikanorovich?" he said, addressing "Uncle."
27044. 
27045. The latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.
27046. 
27047. "How can I join in? Why, you've given a village for each of your
27048. borzois! That's it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours
27049. against one another, you two, and I'll look on!"
27050. 
27051. "Rugay, hey, hey!" he shouted. "Rugayushka!" he added, involuntarily by
27052. this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this
27053. red borzoi. Natasha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and
27054. her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself excited by it.
27055. 
27056. The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the
27057. gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off
27058. on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but not the
27059. gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and sedately.
27060. 
27061. "How is it pointing?" asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward the
27062. whip who had sighted the hare.
27063. 
27064. But before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming
27065. next morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash rushed
27066. downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that
27067. were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt,
27068. who had been moving slowly, shouted, "Stop!" calling in the hounds,
27069. while the borzoi whips, with a cry of "A-tu!" galloped across the field
27070. setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil Ilagin, Nicholas, Natasha,
27071. and "Uncle" flew, reckless of where and how they went, seeing only the
27072. borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant
27073. of the chase. The hare they had started was a strong and swift one. When
27074. he jumped up he did not run at once, but pricked his ears listening to
27075. the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once. He
27076. took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the borzois gain on him,
27077. and, finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger, laid
27078. back his ears and rushed off headlong. He had been lying in the stubble,
27079. but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft.
27080. The two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him, having been the
27081. nearest, were the first to see and pursue him, but they had not gone far
27082. before Ilagin's red-spotted Erza passed them, got within a length, flew
27083. at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking
27084. she had seized him, rolled over like a ball. The hare arched his
27085. back and bounded off yet more swiftly. From behind Erza rushed the
27086. broad-haunched, black-spotted Milka and began rapidly gaining on the
27087. hare.
27088. 
27089. "Milashka, dear!" rose Nicholas' triumphant cry. It looked as if Milka
27090. would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and flew
27091. past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erza reached him, but
27092. when close to the hare's scut paused as if measuring the distance, so as
27093. not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg.
27094. 
27095. "Erza, darling!" Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erza did not
27096. hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have seized her
27097. prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye
27098. and the stubble. Again Erza and Milka were abreast, running like a pair
27099. of carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but it was easier
27100. for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so
27101. quickly.
27102. 
27103. "Rugay, Rugayushka! That's it, come on!" came a third voice just then,
27104. and "Uncle's" red borzoi, straining and curving its back, caught up
27105. with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless of the
27106. terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off the balk
27107. onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously, sinking to
27108. his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was how, muddying
27109. his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of borzois surrounded
27110. him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs. Only
27111. the delighted "Uncle" dismounted, and cut off a pad, shaking the hare
27112. for the blood to drip off, and anxiously glancing round with restless
27113. eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He spoke without himself knowing
27114. whom to or what about. "That's it, come on! That's a dog!... There,
27115. it has beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble
27116. borzois. That's it, come on!" said he, panting and looking wrathfully
27117. around as if he were abusing someone, as if they were all his enemies
27118. and had insulted him, and only now had he at last succeeded in
27119. justifying himself. "There are your thousand-ruble ones.... That's it,
27120. come on!..."
27121. 
27122. "Rugay, here's a pad for you!" he said, throwing down the hare's muddy
27123. pad. "You've deserved it, that's it, come on!"
27124. 
27125. "She'd tired herself out, she'd run it down three times by herself,"
27126. said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he
27127. were heard or not.
27128. 
27129. "But what is there in running across it like that?" said Ilagin's groom.
27130. 
27131. "Once she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take it,"
27132. Ilagin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop and his
27133. excitement. At the same moment Natasha, without drawing breath, screamed
27134. joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set everyone's ear
27135. tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all
27136. talking at once, and it was so strange that she must herself have been
27137. ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it
27138. at any other time. "Uncle" himself twisted up the hare, threw it neatly
27139. and smartly across his horse's back as if by that gesture he meant to
27140. rebuke everybody, and, with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone,
27141. mounted his bay and rode off. The others all followed, dispirited and
27142. shamefaced, and only much later were they able to regain their former
27143. affectation of indifference. For a long time they continued to look at
27144. red Rugay who, his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring
27145. of his leash, walked along just behind "Uncle's" horse with the serene
27146. air of a conqueror.
27147. 
27148. "Well, I am like any other dog as long as it's not a question of
27149. coursing. But when it is, then look out!" his appearance seemed to
27150. Nicholas to be saying.
27151. 
27152. When, much later, "Uncle" rode up to Nicholas and began talking to him,
27153. he felt flattered that, after what had happened, "Uncle" deigned to
27154. speak to him.
27155. 
27156. 
27157. 
27158. 
27159. 
27160. CHAPTER VII
27161. 
27162. 
27163. Toward evening Ilagin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they were
27164. so far from home that he accepted "Uncle's" offer that the hunting party
27165. should spend the night in his little village of Mikhaylovna.
27166. 
27167. "And if you put up at my house that will be better still. That's it,
27168. come on!" said "Uncle." "You see it's damp weather, and you could rest,
27169. and the little countess could be driven home in a trap."
27170. 
27171. "Uncle's" offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to Otradnoe for a
27172. trap, while Nicholas rode with Natasha and Petya to "Uncle's" house.
27173. 
27174. Some five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front
27175. porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as
27176. well as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at
27177. the hunters who were arriving. The presence of Natasha--a woman, a lady,
27178. and on horseback--raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree
27179. that many of them came up to her, stared her in the face, and unabashed
27180. by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy
27181. on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said
27182. about her.
27183. 
27184. "Arinka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt
27185. dangles.... See, she's got a little hunting horn!"
27186. 
27187. "Goodness gracious! See her knife?..."
27188. 
27189. "Isn't she a Tartar!"
27190. 
27191. "How is it you didn't go head over heels?" asked the boldest of all,
27192. addressing Natasha directly.
27193. 
27194. "Uncle" dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which
27195. stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his
27196. retainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take
27197. themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to
27198. receive the guests and the visitors.
27199. 
27200. The serfs all dispersed. "Uncle" lifted Natasha off her horse and taking
27201. her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch. The house,
27202. with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean--it did not seem
27203. that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless--but neither was
27204. it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of fresh apples,
27205. and wolf and fox skins hung about.
27206. 
27207. "Uncle" led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a
27208. folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round
27209. birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where
27210. there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suvorov, of
27211. the host's father and mother, and of himself in military uniform. The
27212. study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. "Uncle" asked his visitors
27213. to sit down and make themselves at home, and then went out of the room.
27214. Rugay, his back still muddy, came into the room and lay down on the
27215. sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth. Leading from the study
27216. was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen.
27217. From behind this came women's laughter and whispers. Natasha, Nicholas,
27218. and Petya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa. Petya, leaning
27219. on his elbow, fell asleep at once. Natasha and Nicholas were silent.
27220. Their faces glowed, they were hungry and very cheerful. They looked
27221. at one another (now that the hunt was over and they were in the house,
27222. Nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority
27223. over his sister), Natasha gave him a wink, and neither refrained long
27224. from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a
27225. pretext ready to account for it.
27226. 
27227. After a while "Uncle" came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and
27228. small top boots. And Natasha felt that this costume, the very one she
27229. had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otradnoe, was just the right
27230. thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat. "Uncle"
27231. too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the brother's
27232. and sister's laughter (it could never enter his head that they might be
27233. laughing at his way of life) he himself joined in the merriment.
27234. 
27235. "That's right, young countess, that's it, come on! I never saw anyone
27236. like her!" said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem and, with
27237. a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another that had been
27238. cut short. "She's ridden all day like a man, and is as fresh as ever!"
27239. 
27240. Soon after "Uncle's" reappearance the door was opened, evidently from
27241. the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking woman
27242. of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered carrying a
27243. large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance
27244. and in every motion, she looked at the visitors and, with a pleasant
27245. smile, bowed respectfully. In spite of her exceptional stoutness, which
27246. caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head,
27247. this woman (who was "Uncle's" housekeeper) trod very lightly. She went
27248. to the table, set down the tray, and with her plump white hands deftly
27249. took from it the bottles and various hors d'oeuvres and dishes and
27250. arranged them on the table. When she had finished, she stepped aside and
27251. stopped at the door with a smile on her face. "Here I am. I am she! Now
27252. do you understand 'Uncle'?" her expression said to Rostov. How could one
27253. help understanding? Not only Nicholas, but even Natasha understood
27254. the meaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that
27255. slightly puckered his lips when Anisya Fedorovna entered. On the tray
27256. was a bottle of herb wine, different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms,
27257. rye cakes made with buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and
27258. sparkling mead, apples, nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey
27259. sweets. Afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves
27260. made with honey, and preserves made with sugar.
27261. 
27262. All this was the fruit of Anisya Fedorovna's housekeeping, gathered and
27263. prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a smack of Anisya
27264. Fedorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness, whiteness, and
27265. pleasant smiles.
27266. 
27267. "Take this, little Lady-Countess!" she kept saying, as she offered
27268. Natasha first one thing and then another.
27269. 
27270. Natasha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such
27271. buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, or such
27272. a chicken anywhere. Anisya Fedorovna left the room.
27273. 
27274. After supper, over their cherry brandy, Rostov and "Uncle" talked of
27275. past and future hunts, of Rugay and Ilagin's dogs, while Natasha sat
27276. upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried several
27277. times to wake Petya that he might eat something, but he only muttered
27278. incoherent words without waking up. Natasha felt so lighthearted and
27279. happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would
27280. come for her too soon. After a casual pause, such as often occurs
27281. when receiving friends for the first time in one's own house, "Uncle,"
27282. answering a thought that was in his visitors' mind, said:
27283. 
27284. "This, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come. That's
27285. it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?"
27286. 
27287. "Uncle's" face was very significant and even handsome as he said this.
27288. Involuntarily Rostov recalled all the good he had heard about him from
27289. his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province "Uncle" had
27290. the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks.
27291. They called him in to decide family disputes, chose him as executor,
27292. confided secrets to him, elected him to be a justice and to other posts;
27293. but he always persistently refused public appointments, passing the
27294. autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding, sitting at home in
27295. winter, and lying in his overgrown garden in summer.
27296. 
27297. "Why don't you enter the service, Uncle?"
27298. 
27299. "I did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That's it, come on! I
27300. can't make head or tail of it. That's for you--I haven't brains enough.
27301. Now, hunting is another matter--that's it, come on! Open the door,
27302. there!" he shouted. "Why have you shut it?"
27303. 
27304. The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen's room, as they
27305. called the room for the hunt servants.
27306. 
27307. There was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the
27308. door into the huntsmen's room, from which came the clear sounds of a
27309. balalayka on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was
27310. playing. Natasha had been listening to those strains for some time and
27311. now went out into the passage to hear better.
27312. 
27313. "That's Mitka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balalayka. I'm fond
27314. of it," said "Uncle."
27315. 
27316. It was the custom for Mitka to play the balalayka in the huntsmen's room
27317. when "Uncle" returned from the chase. "Uncle" was fond of such music.
27318. 
27319. "How good! Really very good!" said Nicholas with some unintentional
27320. superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him
27321. very much.
27322. 
27323. "Very good?" said Natasha reproachfully, noticing her brother's tone.
27324. "Not 'very good' it's simply delicious!"
27325. 
27326. Just as "Uncle's" pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had seemed
27327. to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that moment, seemed
27328. to her the acme of musical delight.
27329. 
27330. "More, please, more!" cried Natasha at the door as soon as the balalayka
27331. ceased. Mitka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming the balalayka
27332. to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations. "Uncle" sat
27333. listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side. The air was
27334. repeated a hundred times. The balalayka was retuned several times and
27335. the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did not grow weary
27336. of it and wished to hear it again and again. Anisya Fedorovna came in
27337. and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.
27338. 
27339. "You like listening?" she said to Natasha, with a smile extremely like
27340. "Uncle's." "That's a good player of ours," she added.
27341. 
27342. "He doesn't play that part right!" said "Uncle" suddenly, with an
27343. energetic gesture. "Here he ought to burst out--that's it, come
27344. on!--ought to burst out."
27345. 
27346. "Do you play then?" asked Natasha.
27347. 
27348. "Uncle" did not answer, but smiled.
27349. 
27350. "Anisya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I haven't
27351. touched it for a long time. That's it--come on! I've given it up."
27352. 
27353. Anisya Fedorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her
27354. errand and brought back the guitar.
27355. 
27356. Without looking at anyone, "Uncle" blew the dust off it and, tapping the
27357. case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself in his
27358. armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching
27359. his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at
27360. Anisya Fedorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then
27361. quietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow time, not
27362. My Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the street. The
27363. tune, played with precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the
27364. hearts of Nicholas and Natasha, arousing in them the same kind of sober
27365. mirth as radiated from Anisya Fedorovna's whole being. Anisya Fedorovna
27366. flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of
27367. the room. "Uncle" continued to play correctly, carefully, with energetic
27368. firmness, looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot
27369. where Anisya Fedorovna had just stood. Something seemed to be laughing
27370. a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches, especially as
27371. the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when, here and there, as
27372. he ran his fingers over the strings, something seemed to snap.
27373. 
27374. "Lovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!" shouted Natasha as soon as he had
27375. finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. "Nicholas, Nicholas!"
27376. she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: "What is it moves me
27377. so?"
27378. 
27379. Nicholas too was greatly pleased by "Uncle's" playing, and "Uncle"
27380. played the piece over again. Anisya Fedorovna's smiling face reappeared
27381. in the doorway and behind hers other faces...
27382. 
27383.     Fetching water clear and sweet,
27384.     Stop, dear maiden, I entreat--
27385. 
27386. played "Uncle" once more, running his fingers skillfully over the
27387. strings, and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.
27388. 
27389. "Go on, Uncle dear," Natasha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life
27390. depended on it.
27391. 
27392. "Uncle" rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of them
27393. smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow struck a
27394. naive and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.
27395. 
27396. "Now then, niece!" he exclaimed, waving to Natasha the hand that had
27397. just struck a chord.
27398. 
27399. Natasha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to face
27400. "Uncle," and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her
27401. shoulders and struck an attitude.
27402. 
27403. Where, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an emigree
27404. French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit
27405. and obtained that manner which the pas de chale * would, one would have
27406. supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the movements were
27407. those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that "Uncle" had expected
27408. of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and smiled triumphantly,
27409. proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that had at first seized
27410. Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an
27411. end, and they were already admiring her.
27412. 
27413. 
27414.     * The French shawl dance.
27415. 
27416. 
27417. She did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision,
27418. that Anisya Fedorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she
27419. needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she
27420. watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so
27421. different from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was in
27422. Anisya and in Anisya's father and mother and aunt, and in every Russian
27423. man and woman.
27424. 
27425. "Well, little countess; that's it--come on!" cried "Uncle," with a
27426. joyous laugh, having finished the dance. "Well done, niece! Now a fine
27427. young fellow must be found as husband for you. That's it--come on!"
27428. 
27429. "He's chosen already," said Nicholas smiling.
27430. 
27431. "Oh?" said "Uncle" in surprise, looking inquiringly at Natasha, who
27432. nodded her head with a happy smile.
27433. 
27434. "And such a one!" she said. But as soon as she had said it a new train
27435. of thoughts and feelings arose in her. "What did Nicholas' smile mean
27436. when he said 'chosen already'? Is he glad of it or not? It is as if he
27437. thought my Bolkonski would not approve of or understand our gaiety. But
27438. he would understand it all. Where is he now?" she thought, and her face
27439. suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a second. "Don't dare
27440. to think about it," she said to herself, and sat down again smilingly
27441. beside "Uncle," begging him to play something more.
27442. 
27443. "Uncle" played another song and a valse; then after a pause he cleared
27444. his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:
27445. 
27446.     As 'twas growing dark last night
27447.     Fell the snow so soft and light...
27448. 
27449. 
27450. "Uncle" sang as peasants sing, with full and naive conviction that the
27451. whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of
27452. itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which exists
27453. only to give measure to the words. As a result of this the unconsidered
27454. tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. Natasha was in
27455. ecstasies over "Uncle's" singing. She resolved to give up learning the
27456. harp and to play only the guitar. She asked "Uncle" for his guitar and
27457. at once found the chords of the song.
27458. 
27459. After nine o'clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been sent
27460. to look for them, arrived to fetch Natasha and Petya. The count and
27461. countess did not know where they were and were very anxious, said one of
27462. the men.
27463. 
27464. Petya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two
27465. traps. Natasha and Nicholas got into the other. "Uncle" wrapped
27466. Natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness. He
27467. accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed,
27468. so that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent huntsmen to ride
27469. in front with lanterns.
27470. 
27471. "Good-by, dear niece," his voice called out of the darkness--not the
27472. voice Natasha had known previously, but the one that had sung As 'twas
27473. growing dark last night.
27474. 
27475. In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a
27476. cheerful smell of smoke.
27477. 
27478. "What a darling Uncle is!" said Natasha, when they had come out onto the
27479. highroad.
27480. 
27481. "Yes," returned Nicholas. "You're not cold?"
27482. 
27483. "No. I'm quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!" answered
27484. Natasha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long
27485. while. The night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but
27486. only heard them splashing through the unseen mud.
27487. 
27488. What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught
27489. and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did they all
27490. find place in her? But she was very happy. As they were nearing home she
27491. suddenly struck up the air of As 'twas growing dark last night--the tune
27492. of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught.
27493. 
27494. "Got it?" said Nicholas.
27495. 
27496. "What were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?" inquired Natasha.
27497. 
27498. They were fond of asking one another that question.
27499. 
27500. "I?" said Nicholas, trying to remember. "Well, you see, first I thought
27501. that Rugay, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were a man he
27502. would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then for his
27503. manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don't you think so?... Well, and
27504. you?"
27505. 
27506. "I? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving along
27507. and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows where we are
27508. really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive and suddenly find
27509. that we are not in Otradnoe, but in Fairyland. And then I thought... No,
27510. nothing else."
27511. 
27512. "I know, I expect you thought of him," said Nicholas, smiling as Natasha
27513. knew by the sound of his voice.
27514. 
27515. "No," said Natasha, though she had in reality been thinking about Prince
27516. Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would have liked
27517. "Uncle." "And then I was saying to myself all the way, 'How well Anisya
27518. carried herself, how well!'" And Nicholas heard her spontaneous, happy,
27519. ringing laughter. "And do you know," she suddenly said, "I know that I
27520. shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now."
27521. 
27522. "Rubbish, nonsense, humbug!" exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought: "How
27523. charming this Natasha of mine is! I have no other friend like her and
27524. never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive about
27525. together!"
27526. 
27527. "What a darling this Nicholas of mine is!" thought Natasha.
27528. 
27529. "Ah, there are still lights in the drawingroom!" she said, pointing to
27530. the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety
27531. darkness of the night.
27532. 
27533. 
27534. 
27535. 
27536. 
27537. CHAPTER VIII
27538. 
27539. 
27540. Count Ilya Rostov had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility
27541. because it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs did
27542. not improve. Natasha and Nicholas often noticed their parents conferring
27543. together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the
27544. fine ancestral Rostov house and estate near Moscow. It was not necessary
27545. to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal, and life at
27546. Otradnoe was quieter than in former years, but still the enormous house
27547. and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to
27548. table every day. These were all their own people who had settled down
27549. in the house almost as members of the family, or persons who were, it
27550. seemed, obliged to live in the count's house. Such were Dimmler the
27551. musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing master and his family, Belova,
27552. an old maiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many others such as
27553. Petya's tutors, the girls' former governess, and other people who simply
27554. found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the count's house
27555. than at home. They had not as many visitors as before, but the old
27556. habits of life without which the count and countess could not
27557. conceive of existence remained unchanged. There was still the hunting
27558. establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged, the same fifty horses
27559. and fifteen grooms in the stables, the same expensive presents and
27560. dinner parties to the whole district on name days; there were still the
27561. count's games of whist and boston, at which--spreading out his cards so
27562. that everybody could see them--he let himself be plundered of hundreds
27563. of rubles every day by his neighbors, who looked upon an opportunity to
27564. play a rubber with Count Rostov as a most profitable source of income.
27565. 
27566. The count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to believe
27567. that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step, and
27568. feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and
27569. patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her loving heart, felt
27570. that her children were being ruined, that it was not the count's fault
27571. for he could not help being what he was--that (though he tried to
27572. hide it) he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his
27573. children's ruin, and she tried to find means of remedying the position.
27574. From her feminine point of view she could see only one solution, namely,
27575. for Nicholas to marry a rich heiress. She felt this to be their last
27576. hope and that if Nicholas refused the match she had found for him, she
27577. would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right. This match
27578. was with Julie Karagina, the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents,
27579. a girl the Rostovs had known from childhood, and who had now become a
27580. wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers.
27581. 
27582. The countess had written direct to Julie's mother in Moscow suggesting a
27583. marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer
27584. from her. Karagina had replied that for her part she was agreeable, and
27585. everything depend on her daughter's inclination. She invited Nicholas to
27586. come to Moscow.
27587. 
27588. Several times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son that
27589. now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him
27590. married. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that
27591. were accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl
27592. and tried to discover what he thought about marriage.
27593. 
27594. At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to Moscow
27595. during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his mother's
27596. remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced
27597. her to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope of getting
27598. their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie Karagina.
27599. 
27600. "But, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would you expect
27601. me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money?" he
27602. asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question and only
27603. wishing to show his noble-mindedness.
27604. 
27605. "No, you have not understood me," said his mother, not knowing how to
27606. justify herself. "You have not understood me, Nikolenka. It is your
27607. happiness I wish for," she added, feeling that she was telling an
27608. untruth and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.
27609. 
27610. "Mamma, don't cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I will
27611. give my life, anything, to put you at ease," said Nicholas. "I would
27612. sacrifice anything for you--even my feelings."
27613. 
27614. But the countess did not want the question put like that: she did not
27615. want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a sacrifice
27616. for him.
27617. 
27618. "No, you have not understood me, don't let us talk about it," she
27619. replied, wiping away her tears.
27620. 
27621. "Maybe I do love a poor girl," said Nicholas to himself. "Am I to
27622. sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could
27623. speak so to me. Because Sonya is poor I must not love her," he thought,
27624. "must not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should certainly
27625. be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can always
27626. sacrifice my feelings for my family's welfare," he said to himself,
27627. "but I can't coerce my feelings. If I love Sonya, that feeling is for me
27628. stronger and higher than all else."
27629. 
27630. Nicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the
27631. conversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and sometimes
27632. with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and
27633. the portionless Sonya. Though she blamed herself for it, she could
27634. not refrain from grumbling at and worrying Sonya, often pulling her
27635. up without reason, addressing her stiffly as "my dear," and using the
27636. formal "you" instead of the intimate "thou" in speaking to her. The
27637. kindhearted countess was the more vexed with Sonya because that poor,
27638. dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly grateful to
27639. her benefactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and unselfishly in
27640. love with Nicholas, that there were no grounds for finding fault with
27641. her.
27642. 
27643. Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter had
27644. come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he would have
27645. been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly
27646. reopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to defer his return till
27647. the beginning of the new year. Natasha was still as much in love with
27648. her betrothed, found the same comfort in that love, and was still as
27649. ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before; but at
27650. the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits
27651. of depression which she could not master. She felt sorry for herself:
27652. sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to
27653. anyone--while she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved.
27654. 
27655. Things were not cheerful in the Rostovs' home.
27656. 
27657. 
27658. 
27659. 
27660. 
27661. CHAPTER IX
27662. 
27663. 
27664. Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and
27665. wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and the
27666. new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities, though
27667. the calm frost of twenty degrees Reaumur, the dazzling sunshine by day,
27668. and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special
27669. celebration of the season.
27670. 
27671. On the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the
27672. inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest time
27673. of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that morning,
27674. was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was resting in his
27675. study. Sonya sat in the drawing room at the round table, copying a
27676. design for embroidery. The countess was playing patience. Nastasya
27677. Ivanovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old
27678. ladies. Natasha came into the room, went up to Sonya, glanced at
27679. what she was doing, and then went up to her mother and stood without
27680. speaking.
27681. 
27682. "Why are you wandering about like an outcast?" asked her mother. "What
27683. do you want?"
27684. 
27685. "Him... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!" said Natasha, with
27686. glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.
27687. 
27688. The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.
27689. 
27690. "Don't look at me, Mamma! Don't look; I shall cry directly."
27691. 
27692. "Sit down with me a little," said the countess.
27693. 
27694. "Mamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?"
27695. 
27696. Her voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned quickly to
27697. hide them and left the room.
27698. 
27699. She passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and then
27700. went into the maids' room. There an old maidservant was grumbling at a
27701. young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold from
27702. the serfs' quarters.
27703. 
27704. "Stop playing--there's a time for everything," said the old woman.
27705. 
27706. "Let her alone, Kondratevna," said Natasha. "Go, Mavrushka, go."
27707. 
27708. Having released Mavrushka, Natasha crossed the dancing hall and went
27709. to the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing
27710. cards. They broke off and rose as she entered.
27711. 
27712. "What can I do with them?" thought Natasha.
27713. 
27714. "Oh, Nikita, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the yard
27715. and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some oats."
27716. 
27717. "Just a few oats?" said Misha, cheerfully and readily.
27718. 
27719. "Go, go quickly," the old man urged him.
27720. 
27721. "And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk."
27722. 
27723. On her way past the butler's pantry she told them to set a samovar,
27724. though it was not at all the time for tea.
27725. 
27726. Foka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house. Natasha
27727. liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order and asked
27728. whether the samovar was really wanted.
27729. 
27730. "Oh dear, what a young lady!" said Foka, pretending to frown at Natasha.
27731. 
27732. No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as
27733. Natasha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to send
27734. them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of them would
27735. get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no one's orders so
27736. readily as they did hers. "What can I do, where can I go?" thought she,
27737. as she went slowly along the passage.
27738. 
27739. "Nastasya Ivanovna, what sort of children shall I have?" she asked the
27740. buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman's jacket.
27741. 
27742. "Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers," answered the buffoon.
27743. 
27744. "O Lord, O Lord, it's always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What am I
27745. to do with myself?" And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly upstairs
27746. to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.
27747. 
27748. Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which were
27749. plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were discussing
27750. whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Natasha sat down,
27751. listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air, and then got
27752. up again.
27753. 
27754. "The island of Madagascar," she said, "Ma-da-gas-car," she repeated,
27755. articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to Madame
27756. Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the room.
27757. 
27758. Her brother Petya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on him he
27759. was preparing fireworks to let off that night.
27760. 
27761. "Petya! Petya!" she called to him. "Carry me downstairs."
27762. 
27763. Petya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her
27764. arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.
27765. 
27766. "No, don't... the island of Madagascar!" she said, and jumping off his
27767. back she went downstairs.
27768. 
27769. Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made sure
27770. that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was dull, Natasha
27771. betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar, sat down in a dark
27772. corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her fingers over the strings
27773. in the bass, picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had
27774. heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew. What she drew from the guitar
27775. would have had no meaning for other listeners, but in her imagination
27776. a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds. She sat behind
27777. the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the
27778. pantry door and listened to herself and pondered. She was in a mood for
27779. brooding on the past.
27780. 
27781. Sonya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natasha glanced at
27782. her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her that she
27783. remembered the light falling through that crack once before and Sonya
27784. passing with a glass in her hand. "Yes it was exactly the same," thought
27785. Natasha.
27786. 
27787. "Sonya, what is this?" she cried, twanging a thick string.
27788. 
27789. "Oh, you are there!" said Sonya with a start, and came near and
27790. listened. "I don't know. A storm?" she ventured timidly, afraid of being
27791. wrong.
27792. 
27793. "There! That's just how she started and just how she came up smiling
27794. timidly when all this happened before," thought Natasha, "and in just
27795. the same way I thought there was something lacking in her."
27796. 
27797. "No, it's the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!" and Natasha sang
27798. the air of the chorus so that Sonya should catch it. "Where were you
27799. going?" she asked.
27800. 
27801. "To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design."
27802. 
27803. "You always find something to do, but I can't," said Natasha. "And
27804. where's Nicholas?"
27805. 
27806. "Asleep, I think."
27807. 
27808. "Sonya, go and wake him," said Natasha. "Tell him I want him to come and
27809. sing."
27810. 
27811. She sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
27812. before could be, and without solving this problem, or at all regretting
27813. not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time when she was
27814. with him and he was looking at her with a lover's eyes.
27815. 
27816. "Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be!
27817. And, worst of all, I am growing old--that's the thing! There won't then
27818. be in me what there is now. But perhaps he'll come today, will come
27819. immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room.
27820. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it." She rose, put down
27821. the guitar, and went to the drawing room.
27822. 
27823. All the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were already
27824. at the tea table. The servants stood round the table--but Prince Andrew
27825. was not there and life was going on as before.
27826. 
27827. "Ah, here she is!" said the old count, when he saw Natasha enter. "Well,
27828. sit down by me." But Natasha stayed by her mother and glanced round as
27829. if looking for something.
27830. 
27831. "Mamma!" she muttered, "give him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,
27832. quickly!" and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.
27833. 
27834. She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the
27835. elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. "My God, my God!
27836. The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in the
27837. same way!" thought Natasha, feeling with horror a sense of repulsion
27838. rising up in her for the whole household, because they were always the
27839. same.
27840. 
27841. After tea, Nicholas, Sonya, and Natasha went to the sitting room, to
27842. their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.
27843. 
27844. 
27845. 
27846. 
27847. 
27848. CHAPTER X
27849. 
27850. 
27851. "Does it ever happen to you," said Natasha to her brother, when they
27852. settled down in the sitting room, "does it ever happen to you to feel
27853. as if there were nothing more to come--nothing; that everything good is
27854. past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?"
27855. 
27856. "I should think so!" he replied. "I have felt like that when everything
27857. was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has come into my
27858. mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must all die.
27859. Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there was
27860. music... and suddenly I felt so depressed..."
27861. 
27862. "Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!" Natasha interrupted him. "When I was
27863. quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when I was
27864. punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat sobbing
27865. in the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and sorry for
27866. everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was innocent--that was the
27867. chief thing," said Natasha. "Do you remember?"
27868. 
27869. "I remember," answered Nicholas. "I remember that I came to you
27870. afterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt ashamed
27871. to. We were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and wanted to give
27872. it to you. Do you remember?"
27873. 
27874. "And do you remember," Natasha asked with a pensive smile, "how once,
27875. long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us into the
27876. study--that was in the old house--and it was dark--we went in and
27877. suddenly there stood..."
27878. 
27879. "A Negro," chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. "Of course I
27880. remember. Even now I don't know whether there really was a Negro, or if
27881. we only dreamed it or were told about him."
27882. 
27883. "He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked at
27884. us..."
27885. 
27886. "Sonya, do you remember?" asked Nicholas.
27887. 
27888. "Yes, yes, I do remember something too," Sonya answered timidly.
27889. 
27890. "You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro," said Natasha,
27891. "and they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you remember!"
27892. 
27893. "Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them."
27894. 
27895. "How strange it is! It's as if it were a dream! I like that."
27896. 
27897. "And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom, and
27898. suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was that real
27899. or not? Do you remember what fun it was?"
27900. 
27901. "Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the
27902. porch?"
27903. 
27904. So they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not the sad
27905. memories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones--those impressions of
27906. one's most distant past in which dreams and realities blend--and they
27907. laughed with quiet enjoyment.
27908. 
27909. Sonya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they shared
27910. the same reminiscences.
27911. 
27912. Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she
27913. recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced. She
27914. simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.
27915. 
27916. She only really took part when they recalled Sonya's first arrival. She
27917. told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a corded
27918. jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too, would be sewn up with
27919. cords.
27920. 
27921. "And I remember their telling me that you had been born under a
27922. cabbage," said Natasha, "and I remember that I dared not disbelieve it
27923. then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable."
27924. 
27925. While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of
27926. the sitting room.
27927. 
27928. "They have brought the cock, Miss," she said in a whisper.
27929. 
27930. "It isn't wanted, Petya. Tell them to take it away," replied Natasha.
27931. 
27932. In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and
27933. went up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its cloth
27934. covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.
27935. 
27936. "Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field," came the old
27937. countess' voice from the drawing room.
27938. 
27939. Dimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natasha, Nicholas, and Sonya,
27940. remarked: "How quiet you young people are!"
27941. 
27942. "Yes, we're philosophizing," said Natasha, glancing round for a moment
27943. and then continuing the conversation. They were now discussing dreams.
27944. 
27945. Dimmler began to play; Natasha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table,
27946. took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself quietly
27947. in her former place. It was dark in the room especially where they were
27948. sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the silvery light of
27949. the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but
27950. still sat softly running his fingers over the strings, evidently
27951. uncertain whether to stop or to play something else.
27952. 
27953. "Do you know," said Natasha in a whisper, moving closer to Nicholas and
27954. Sonya, "that when one goes on and on recalling memories, one at last
27955. begins to remember what happened before one was in the world..."
27956. 
27957. "That is metempsychosis," said Sonya, who had always learned well, and
27958. remembered everything. "The Egyptians believed that our souls have lived
27959. in animals, and will go back into animals again."
27960. 
27961. "No, I don't believe we ever were in animals," said Natasha, still in
27962. a whisper though the music had ceased. "But I am certain that we
27963. were angels somewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we
27964. remember...."
27965. 
27966. "May I join you?" said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat down
27967. by them.
27968. 
27969. "If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?" said Nicholas. "No,
27970. that can't be!"
27971. 
27972. "Not lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I was before?"
27973. Natasha rejoined with conviction. "The soul is immortal--well then, if I
27974. shall always live I must have lived before, lived for a whole eternity."
27975. 
27976. "Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity," remarked Dimmler,
27977. who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now
27978. spoke as quietly and seriously as they.
27979. 
27980. "Why is it hard to imagine eternity?" said Natasha. "It is now today,
27981. and it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday, and the
27982. day before..."
27983. 
27984. "Natasha! Now it's your turn. Sing me something," they heard the
27985. countess say. "Why are you sitting there like conspirators?"
27986. 
27987. "Mamma, I don't at all want to," replied Natasha, but all the same she
27988. rose.
27989. 
27990. None of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break off
27991. their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but Natasha
27992. got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing as usual in the
27993. middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best,
27994. Natasha began to sing her mother's favorite song.
27995. 
27996. She had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had
27997. sung, and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The
27998. count, from his study where he was talking to Mitenka, heard her and,
27999. like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk
28000. while giving orders to the steward, and at last stopped, while Mitenka
28001. stood in front of him also listening and smiling. Nicholas did not take
28002. his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her. Sonya, as she
28003. listened, thought of the immense difference there was between herself
28004. and her friend, and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as
28005. bewitching as her cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad
28006. smile and with tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She
28007. thought of Natasha and of her own youth, and of how there was something
28008. unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of Natasha and Prince
28009. Andrew.
28010. 
28011. Dimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with
28012. closed eyes.
28013. 
28014. "Ah, Countess," he said at last, "that's a European talent, she has
28015. nothing to learn--what softness, tenderness, and strength...."
28016. 
28017. "Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!" said the countess, not
28018. realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her that
28019. Natasha had too much of something, and that because of this she would
28020. not be happy. Before Natasha had finished singing, fourteen-year-old
28021. Petya rushed in delightedly, to say that some mummers had arrived.
28022. 
28023. Natasha stopped abruptly.
28024. 
28025. "Idiot!" she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair, threw
28026. herself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long
28027. time.
28028. 
28029. "It's nothing, Mamma, really it's nothing; only Petya startled me," she
28030. said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked
28031. her.
28032. 
28033. The mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,
28034. innkeepers, and ladies--frightening and funny--bringing in with them the
28035. cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first timidly,
28036. into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed into
28037. the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily and
28038. heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas games.
28039. The countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their
28040. costumes, went into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom,
28041. smiling radiantly and applauding the players. The young people had
28042. disappeared.
28043. 
28044. Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
28045. ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt--this was Nicholas. A Turkish
28046. girl was Petya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Natasha, and a
28047. Circassian was Sonya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.
28048. 
28049. After the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from those
28050. who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided that their
28051. costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere.
28052. 
28053. Nicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to take
28054. them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them about a
28055. dozen of the serf mummers and drive to "Uncle's."
28056. 
28057. "No, why disturb the old fellow?" said the countess. "Besides, you
28058. wouldn't have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the
28059. Melyukovs'."
28060. 
28061. Melyukova was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and
28062. governesses, lived three miles from the Rostovs.
28063. 
28064. "That's right, my dear," chimed in the old count, thoroughly aroused.
28065. "I'll dress up at once and go with them. I'll make Pashette open her
28066. eyes."
28067. 
28068. But the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad leg all
28069. these last days. It was decided that the count must not go, but that
28070. if Louisa Ivanovna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the young ladies
28071. might go to the Melyukovs', Sonya, generally so timid and shy, more
28072. urgently than anyone begging Louisa Ivanovna not to refuse.
28073. 
28074. Sonya's costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows were
28075. extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very handsome,
28076. and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her. Some
28077. inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and
28078. in her male attire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa Ivanovna
28079. consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and
28080. small bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow,
28081. drove up to the porch.
28082. 
28083. Natasha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing
28084. from one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all
28085. came out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to
28086. one another, laughing, and shouting.
28087. 
28088. Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was
28089. the old count's with a trotter from the Orlov stud as shaft horse,
28090. the fourth was Nicholas' own with a short shaggy black shaft horse.
28091. Nicholas, in his old lady's dress over which he had belted his hussar
28092. overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.
28093. 
28094. It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal
28095. harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked round in alarm
28096. at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.
28097. 
28098. Natasha, Sonya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas' sleigh;
28099. Dimmler, his wife, and Petya, into the old count's, and the rest of the
28100. mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.
28101. 
28102. "You go ahead, Zakhar!" shouted Nicholas to his father's coachman,
28103. wishing for a chance to race past him.
28104. 
28105. The old count's troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,
28106. squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its deep-toned
28107. bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the
28108. middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar,
28109. and threw it up.
28110. 
28111. Nicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the others
28112. moved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove at a steady
28113. trot along the narrow road. While they drove past the garden the shadows
28114. of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant
28115. moonlight, but as soon as they were past the fence, the snowy plain
28116. bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering
28117. like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows. Bang, bang! went the
28118. first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road, and each of
28119. the other sleighs jolted in the same way, and rudely breaking the
28120. frost-bound stillness, the troykas began to speed along the road, one
28121. after the other.
28122. 
28123. "A hare's track, a lot of tracks!" rang out Natasha's voice through the
28124. frost-bound air.
28125. 
28126. "How light it is, Nicholas!" came Sonya's voice.
28127. 
28128. Nicholas glanced round at Sonya, and bent down to see her face closer.
28129. Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at
28130. him from her sable furs--so close and yet so distant--in the moonlight.
28131. 
28132. "That used to be Sonya," thought he, and looked at her closer and
28133. smiled.
28134. 
28135. "What is it, Nicholas?"
28136. 
28137. "Nothing," said he and turned again to the horses.
28138. 
28139. When they came out onto the beaten highroad--polished by sleigh runners
28140. and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were visible in the
28141. moonlight--the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and
28142. increased their pace. The near side horse, arching his head and breaking
28143. into a short canter, tugged at his traces. The shaft horse swayed from
28144. side to side, moving his ears as if asking: "Isn't it time to begin
28145. now?" In front, already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing
28146. farther and farther off, the black horses driven by Zakhar could be
28147. clearly seen against the white snow. From that sleigh one could hear the
28148. shouts, laughter, and voices of the mummers.
28149. 
28150. "Gee up, my darlings!" shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one side
28151. and flourishing the whip.
28152. 
28153. It was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the
28154. side horses who pulled harder--ever increasing their gallop--that one
28155. noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With
28156. screams squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
28157. to gallop--the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily
28158. beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and
28159. ready to put on speed when required.
28160. 
28161. Nicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and
28162. coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.
28163. 
28164. "Where are we?" thought he. "It's the Kosoy meadow, I suppose. But
28165. no--this is something new I've never seen before. This isn't the Kosoy
28166. meadow nor the Demkin hill, and heaven only knows what it is! It is
28167. something new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be..." And shouting
28168. to his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.
28169. 
28170. Zakhar held back his horses and turned his face, which was already
28171. covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.
28172. 
28173. Nicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zakhar, stretching out his arms,
28174. clucked his tongue and let his horses go.
28175. 
28176. "Now, look out, master!" he cried.
28177. 
28178. Faster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved the
28179. feet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead. Zakhar,
28180. while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with the reins.
28181. 
28182. "No you won't, master!" he shouted.
28183. 
28184. Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhar. The horses
28185. showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh--beside
28186. them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of
28187. swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing.
28188. The whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls
28189. shrieking were heard from different sides.
28190. 
28191. Again checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were still
28192. surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with
28193. stars.
28194. 
28195. "Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the
28196. left?" thought Nicholas. "Are we getting to the Melyukovs'? Is this
28197. Melyukovka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows what
28198. is happening to us--but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is."
28199. And he looked round in the sleigh.
28200. 
28201. "Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!" said one of the
28202. strange, pretty, unfamiliar people--the one with fine eyebrows and
28203. mustache.
28204. 
28205. "I think this used to be Natasha," thought Nicholas, "and that was
28206. Madame Schoss, but perhaps it's not, and this Circassian with the
28207. mustache I don't know, but I love her."
28208. 
28209. "Aren't you cold?" he asked.
28210. 
28211. They did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh behind
28212. shouted something--probably something funny--but they could not make out
28213. what he said.
28214. 
28215. "Yes, yes!" some voices answered, laughing.
28216. 
28217. "But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a glitter
28218. of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy
28219. buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And if this is really
28220. Melyukovka, it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and
28221. have come to Melyukovka," thought Nicholas.
28222. 
28223. It really was Melyukovka, and maids and footmen with merry faces came
28224. running, out to the porch carrying candles.
28225. 
28226. "Who is it?" asked someone in the porch.
28227. 
28228. "The mummers from the count's. I know by the horses," replied some
28229. voices.
28230. 
28231. 
28232. 
28233. 
28234. 
28235. CHAPTER XI
28236. 
28237. 
28238. Pelageya Danilovna Melyukova, a broadly built, energetic woman wearing
28239. spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, surrounded by
28240. her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull. They were
28241. quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax
28242. figures would throw on the wall, when they heard the steps and voices of
28243. new arrivals in the vestibule.
28244. 
28245. Hussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their
28246. throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule,
28247. came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The
28248. clown--Dimmler--and the lady--Nicholas--started a dance. Surrounded by
28249. the screaming children the mummers, covering their faces and disguising
28250. their voices, bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the
28251. room.
28252. 
28253. "Dear me! there's no recognizing them! And Natasha! See whom she looks
28254. like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr Dimmler--isn't
28255. he good! I didn't know him! And how he dances. Dear me, there's a
28256. Circassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear Sonya. And who is that?
28257. Well, you have cheered us up! Nikita and Vanya--clear away the tables!
28258. And we were sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The hussar, the hussar!
28259. Just like a boy! And the legs!... I can't look at him..." different
28260. voices were saying.
28261. 
28262. Natasha, the young Melyukovs' favorite, disappeared with them into the
28263. back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments
28264. were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from
28265. behind the door. Ten minutes later, all the young Melyukovs joined the
28266. mummers.
28267. 
28268. Pelageya Danilovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the
28269. visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs,
28270. went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles, peering
28271. into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of
28272. them. It was not merely Dimmler and the Rostovs she failed to recognize,
28273. she did not even recognize her own daughters, or her late husband's,
28274. dressing gowns and uniforms, which they had put on.
28275. 
28276. "And who is this?" she asked her governess, peering into the face of her
28277. own daughter dressed up as a Kazan-Tartar. "I suppose it is one of the
28278. Rostovs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve in?" she asked
28279. Natasha. "Here, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!" she ordered the
28280. butler who was handing things round. "That's not forbidden by his law."
28281. 
28282. Sometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the
28283. dancers, who--having decided once for all that being disguised, no one
28284. would recognize them--were not at all shy, Pelageya Danilovna hid
28285. her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook with
28286. irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.
28287. 
28288. "My little Sasha! Look at Sasha!" she said.
28289. 
28290. After Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelageya Danilovna made
28291. the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a string, and a
28292. silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together.
28293. 
28294. In an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The corked
28295. eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, flushed, and
28296. merry faces. Pelageya Danilovna began to recognize the mummers, admired
28297. their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly how they suited the
28298. young ladies, and she thanked them all for having entertained her so
28299. well. The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room, and the
28300. serfs had something served to them in the ballroom.
28301. 
28302. "Now to tell one's fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!" said
28303. an old maid who lived with the Melyukovs, during supper.
28304. 
28305. "Why?" said the eldest Melyukov girl.
28306. 
28307. "You wouldn't go, it takes courage..."
28308. 
28309. "I'll go," said Sonya.
28310. 
28311. "Tell what happened to the young lady!" said the second Melyukov girl.
28312. 
28313. "Well," began the old maid, "a young lady once went out, took a cock,
28314. laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After sitting a
28315. while, she suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh drives up with
28316. harness bells; she hears him coming! He comes in, just in the shape of a
28317. man, like an officer--comes in and sits down to table with her."
28318. 
28319. "Ah! ah!" screamed Natasha, rolling her eyes with horror.
28320. 
28321. "Yes? And how... did he speak?"
28322. 
28323. "Yes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began persuading
28324. her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow, but she got
28325. frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her hands. Then he
28326. caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just then..."
28327. 
28328. "Now, why frighten them?" said Pelageya Danilovna.
28329. 
28330. "Mamma, you used to try your fate yourself..." said her daughter.
28331. 
28332. "And how does one do it in a barn?" inquired Sonya.
28333. 
28334. "Well, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on what
28335. you hear; hammering and knocking--that's bad; but a sound of shifting
28336. grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too."
28337. 
28338. "Mamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn."
28339. 
28340. Pelageya Danilovna smiled.
28341. 
28342. "Oh, I've forgotten..." she replied. "But none of you would go?"
28343. 
28344. "Yes, I will; Pelageya Danilovna, let me! I'll go," said Sonya.
28345. 
28346. "Well, why not, if you're not afraid?"
28347. 
28348. "Louisa Ivanovna, may I?" asked Sonya.
28349. 
28350. Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or
28351. talking as now, Nicholas did not leave Sonya's side, and gazed at her
28352. with quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today, thanks
28353. to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to know her. And
28354. really, that evening, Sonya was brighter, more animated, and prettier
28355. than Nicholas had ever seen her before.
28356. 
28357. "So that's what she is like; what a fool I have been!" he thought gazing
28358. at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile
28359. dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.
28360. 
28361. "I'm not afraid of anything," said Sonya. "May I go at once?" She got
28362. up.
28363. 
28364. They told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen,
28365. and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her head and
28366. shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.
28367. 
28368. "What a darling that girl is!" thought he. "And what have I been
28369. thinking of till now?"
28370. 
28371. Sonya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went hastily
28372. to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of people really
28373. had made the house stuffy.
28374. 
28375. Outside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but even
28376. brighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with
28377. so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real
28378. stars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was
28379. gay.
28380. 
28381. "I am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?" thought Nicholas,
28382. and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and
28383. along the path that led to the back porch. He knew Sonya would pass
28384. that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and across and
28385. along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the
28386. snow and on the path. This path led to the barn. The log walls of the
28387. barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked as if hewn out of some
28388. precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight. A tree in the garden snapped
28389. with the frost, and then all was again perfectly silent. His bosom
28390. seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness.
28391. 
28392. From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the
28393. bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard
28394. the voice of an old maidservant saying, "Straight, straight, along the
28395. path, Miss. Only, don't look back."
28396. 
28397. "I am not afraid," answered Sonya's voice, and along the path toward
28398. Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of Sonya's feet in her thin
28399. shoes.
28400. 
28401. Sonya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of paces
28402. away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she
28403. had known and always slightly feared. He was in a woman's dress, with
28404. tousled hair and a happy smile new to Sonya. She ran rapidly toward him.
28405. 
28406. "Quite different and yet the same," thought Nicholas, looking at her
28407. face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the cloak
28408. that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her
28409. on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork. Sonya
28410. kissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little hands pressed
28411. them to his cheeks.
28412. 
28413. "Sonya!... Nicholas!"... was all they said. They ran to the barn and
28414. then back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back porch.
28415. 
28416. 
28417. 
28418. 
28419. 
28420. CHAPTER XII
28421. 
28422. 
28423. When they all drove back from Pelageya Danilovna's, Natasha, who always
28424. saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss should
28425. go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and Sonya with Nicholas and the
28426. maids.
28427. 
28428. On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and
28429. kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into Sonya's face
28430. and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his
28431. present Sonya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again. He
28432. looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new Sonya, and
28433. being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss,
28434. inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and, looking at the ground
28435. flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in
28436. fairyland.
28437. 
28438. "Sonya, is it well with thee?" he asked from time to time.
28439. 
28440. "Yes!" she replied. "And with thee?"
28441. 
28442. When halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for
28443. a moment to Natasha's sleigh and stood on its wing.
28444. 
28445. "Natasha!" he whispered in French, "do you know I have made up my mind
28446. about Sonya?"
28447. 
28448. "Have you told her?" asked Natasha, suddenly beaming all over with joy.
28449. 
28450. "Oh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...
28451. Natasha--are you glad?"
28452. 
28453. "I am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I did not
28454. tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart she has,
28455. Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy while
28456. Sonya was not," continued Natasha. "Now I am so glad! Well, run back to
28457. her."
28458. 
28459. "No, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!" cried Nicholas, peering
28460. into her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual, and
28461. bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before. "Natasha, it's
28462. magical, isn't it?"
28463. 
28464. "Yes," she replied. "You have done splendidly."
28465. 
28466. "Had I seen her before as she is now," thought Nicholas, "I should long
28467. ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me, and
28468. all would have been well."
28469. 
28470. "So you are glad and I have done right?"
28471. 
28472. "Oh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it.
28473. Mamma said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing! I
28474. nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of
28475. Sonya, for there is nothing but good in her."
28476. 
28477. "Then it's all right?" said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the expression
28478. of his sister's face to see if she was in earnest. Then he jumped down
28479. and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his sleigh. The same
28480. happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and beaming eyes looking up
28481. from under a sable hood, was still sitting there, and that Circassian
28482. was Sonya, and that Sonya was certainly his future happy and loving
28483. wife.
28484. 
28485. When they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the
28486. evening at the Melyukovs', the girls went to their bedroom. When they
28487. had undressed, but without washing off the cork mustaches, they sat a
28488. long time talking of their happiness. They talked of how they would live
28489. when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how
28490. happy they would be. On Natasha's table stood two looking glasses which
28491. Dunyasha had prepared beforehand.
28492. 
28493. "Only when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too
28494. good!" said Natasha, rising and going to the looking glasses.
28495. 
28496. "Sit down, Natasha; perhaps you'll see him," said Sonya.
28497. 
28498. Natasha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking glasses,
28499. and sat down.
28500. 
28501. "I see someone with a mustache," said Natasha, seeing her own face.
28502. 
28503. "You mustn't laugh, Miss," said Dunyasha.
28504. 
28505. With Sonya's help and the maid's, Natasha got the glass she held into
28506. the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious
28507. expression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the
28508. receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting (from
28509. tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew, in that
28510. last dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she was to take the
28511. smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin, she saw nothing.
28512. She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses.
28513. 
28514. "Why is it others see things and I don't?" she said. "You sit down now,
28515. Sonya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I feel so
28516. frightened!"
28517. 
28518. Sonya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began
28519. looking.
28520. 
28521. "Now, Miss Sonya is sure to see something," whispered Dunyasha; "while
28522. you do nothing but laugh."
28523. 
28524. Sonya heard this and Natasha's whisper:
28525. 
28526. "I know she will. She saw something last year."
28527. 
28528. For about three minutes all were silent.
28529. 
28530. "Of course she will!" whispered Natasha, but did not finish... suddenly
28531. Sonya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with
28532. her hand.
28533. 
28534. "Oh, Natasha!" she cried.
28535. 
28536. "Did you see? Did you? What was it?" exclaimed Natasha, holding up the
28537. looking glass.
28538. 
28539. Sonya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to get
28540. up when she heard Natasha say, "Of course she will!" She did not wish to
28541. disappoint either Dunyasha or Natasha, but it was hard to sit still.
28542. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she
28543. covered her eyes.
28544. 
28545. "You saw him?" urged Natasha, seizing her hand.
28546. 
28547. "Yes. Wait a bit... I... saw him," Sonya could not help saying, not yet
28548. knowing whom Natasha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.
28549. 
28550. "But why shouldn't I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who can
28551. tell whether I saw anything or not?" flashed through Sonya's mind.
28552. 
28553. "Yes, I saw him," she said.
28554. 
28555. "How? Standing or lying?"
28556. 
28557. "No, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying down."
28558. 
28559. "Andrew lying? Is he ill?" asked Natasha, her frightened eyes fixed on
28560. her friend.
28561. 
28562. "No, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he
28563. turned to me." And when saying this she herself fancied she had really
28564. seen what she described.
28565. 
28566. "Well, and then, Sonya?..."
28567. 
28568. "After that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and
28569. red..."
28570. 
28571. "Sonya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! O, God, how afraid
28572. I am for him and for myself and about everything!..." Natasha began, and
28573. without replying to Sonya's words of comfort she got into bed, and long
28574. after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless, gazing at the
28575. moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.
28576. 
28577. 
28578. 
28579. 
28580. 
28581. CHAPTER XIII
28582. 
28583. 
28584. Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love
28585. for Sonya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess, who had
28586. long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
28587. declaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that he
28588. might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would
28589. give their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the first time,
28590. felt that his mother was displeased with him and that, despite her love
28591. for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without looking at her son,
28592. she sent for her husband and, when he came, tried briefly and coldly to
28593. inform him of the facts, in her son's presence, but unable to restrain
28594. herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room. The old
28595. count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his
28596. purpose. Nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word, and his
28597. father, sighing and evidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and
28598. went in to the countess. In all his encounters with his son, the count
28599. was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the
28600. family fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to
28601. marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless Sonya. On this occasion, he
28602. was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not
28603. been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than Sonya could have
28604. been wished for, and that no one but himself with his Mitenka and
28605. his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family
28606. finances.
28607. 
28608. The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again,
28609. but a few days later the countess sent for Sonya and, with a cruelty
28610. neither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to catch
28611. Nicholas and for ingratitude. Sonya listened silently with downcast eyes
28612. to the countess' cruel words, without understanding what was required
28613. of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors.
28614. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case she could
28615. not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She could not help
28616. loving the countess and the whole Rostov family, but neither could she
28617. help loving Nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that
28618. love. She was silent and sad and did not reply. Nicholas felt the
28619. situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his
28620. mother. He first implored her to forgive him and Sonya and consent to
28621. their marriage, then he threatened that if she molested Sonya he would
28622. at once marry her secretly.
28623. 
28624. The countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her before,
28625. replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying without his
28626. father's consent, and he could do the same, but that she would never
28627. receive that intriguer as her daughter.
28628. 
28629. Exploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told
28630. his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his
28631. feelings, but if that were so, he would say for the last time.... But he
28632. had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face
28633. caused his mother to await with terror, and which would perhaps have
28634. forever remained a cruel memory to them both. He had not time to say it,
28635. for Natasha, with a pale and set face, entered the room from the door at
28636. which she had been listening.
28637. 
28638. "Nicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I
28639. tell you!..." she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.
28640. 
28641. "Mamma darling, it's not at all so... my poor, sweet darling," she
28642. said to her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of
28643. a rupture gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and
28644. excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way.
28645. 
28646. "Nicholas, I'll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling," said
28647. Natasha.
28648. 
28649. Her words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which she
28650. was aiming.
28651. 
28652. The countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter's breast,
28653. while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.
28654. 
28655. Natasha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded
28656. that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that Sonya should not
28657. be troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything
28658. without his parents' knowledge.
28659. 
28660. Firmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment,
28661. to retire from the army and return and marry Sonya, Nicholas, serious,
28662. sorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him,
28663. passionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his
28664. regiment.
28665. 
28666. After Nicholas had gone things in the Rostov household were more
28667. depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.
28668. 
28669. Sonya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on
28670. account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward
28671. her. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his
28672. affairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house and
28673. estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they had
28674. to go to Moscow. But the countess' health obliged them to delay their
28675. departure from day to day.
28676. 
28677. Natasha, who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed
28678. lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and impatient every
28679. day. The thought that her best days, which she would have employed
28680. in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no advantage to anyone,
28681. tormented her incessantly. His letters for the most part irritated her.
28682. It hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him, he
28683. was living a real life, seeing new places and new people that interested
28684. him. The more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt.
28685. Her letters to him, far from giving her any comfort, seemed to her a
28686. wearisome and artificial obligation. She could not write, because she
28687. could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter
28688. even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice, smile, and
28689. glance. She wrote to him formal, monotonous, and dry letters, to which
28690. she attached no importance herself, and in the rough copies of which the
28691. countess corrected her mistakes in spelling.
28692. 
28693. There was still no improvement in the countess' health, but it was
28694. impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. Natasha's
28695. trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince Andrew
28696. was expected in Moscow, where old Prince Bolkonski was spending the
28697. winter, and Natasha felt sure he had already arrived.
28698. 
28699. So the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking Sonya and
28700. Natasha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.

28712. CHAPTER I
28713. 
28714. 
28715. After Prince Andrews engagement to Natasha, Pierre without any apparent
28716. cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before. Firmly
28717. convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor,
28718. and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man, to which he had
28719. devoted himself with such ardor--all the zest of such a life vanished
28720. after the engagement of Andrew and Natasha and the death of Joseph
28721. Alexeevich, the news of which reached him almost at the same time.
28722. Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife who now
28723. enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance with all
28724. Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities. And this
28725. life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He ceased keeping
28726. a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began going to the Club
28727. again, drank a great deal, and came once more in touch with the bachelor
28728. sets, leading such a life that the Countess Helene thought it necessary
28729. to speak severely to him about it. Pierre felt that she was right, and
28730. to avoid compromising her went away to Moscow.
28731. 
28732. In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
28733. fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as,
28734. driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable
28735. tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the Kremlin Square
28736. with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh drivers and hovels of
28737. the Sivtsev Vrazhok, those old Moscovites who desired nothing, hurried
28738. nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he saw those old
28739. Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he felt himself
28740. at home in a quiet haven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at home, warm and
28741. dirty as in an old dressing gown.
28742. 
28743. Moscow society, from the old women down to the children, received Pierre
28744. like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him.
28745. For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most intellectual,
28746. merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial nobleman of
28747. the old Russian type. His purse was always empty because it was open to
28748. everyone.
28749. 
28750. Benefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent societies,
28751. gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees, Freemasons,
28752. churches, and books--no one and nothing met with a refusal from him, and
28753. had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and
28754. taken him under their protection, he would have given everything away.
28755. There was never a dinner or soiree at the Club without him. As soon as
28756. he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux he was
28757. surrounded, and talking, disputing, and joking began. When there
28758. were quarrels, his kindly smile and well-timed jests reconciled the
28759. antagonists. The Masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not
28760. there.
28761. 
28762. When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile,
28763. yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere
28764. with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men.
28765. At balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies, married and
28766. unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of them, he was
28767. equally amiable to all, especially after supper. "Il est charmant; il
28768. n'a pas de sexe," * they said of him.
28769. 
28770. 
28771.     * "He is charming; he has no sex."
28772. 
28773. 
28774. Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were
28775. hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.
28776. 
28777. How horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first
28778. arrived from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him
28779. to seek or plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally
28780. predetermined, and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in
28781. his position were. He could not have believed it! Had he not at one
28782. time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia;
28783. then himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then
28784. a strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the
28785. possibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the sinful
28786. human race, and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection?
28787. Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs?
28788. 
28789. But instead of all that--here he was, the wealthy husband of an
28790. unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and
28791. drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the government
28792. a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal favorite in
28793. Moscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile himself to the
28794. idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow gentlemen-in-waiting
28795. he had so despised seven years before.
28796. 
28797. Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living
28798. this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of how
28799. many, like himself, had entered that life and that Club temporarily,
28800. with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single
28801. tooth or hair remained.
28802. 
28803. In moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to
28804. him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired
28805. gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were empty, stupid,
28806. contented fellows, satisfied with their position, "while I am still
28807. discontented and want to do something for mankind. But perhaps all these
28808. comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new, a
28809. path in life of their own, and like me were brought by force of
28810. circumstances, society, and race--by that elemental force against which
28811. man is powerless--to the condition I am in," said he to himself in
28812. moments of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer
28813. despised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his
28814. comrades in destiny, as he pitied himself.
28815. 
28816. Pierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust
28817. with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such
28818. acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment.
28819. "What for? Why? What is going on in the world?" he would ask himself in
28820. perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to reflect anew
28821. on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by experience that
28822. there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away
28823. from them, and took up a book, or hurried of to the Club or to Apollon
28824. Nikolaevich's, to exchange the gossip of the town.
28825. 
28826. "Helene, who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one
28827. of the stupidest women in the world," thought Pierre, "is regarded by
28828. people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they pay homage
28829. to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great,
28830. but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor Francis wants
28831. to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The Spaniards, through
28832. the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their victory over the
28833. French on the fourteenth of June, and the French, also through the
28834. Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same fourteenth of June
28835. they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons swear by the blood that
28836. they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor, but they
28837. do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor, and they
28838. intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna Seekers, and fuss about an
28839. authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs, and the meaning
28840. of which the very man who wrote it does not understand. We all profess
28841. the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors,
28842. the law in honor of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty
28843. churches--but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister
28844. of that same law of love and forgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a
28845. cross to kiss before his execution." So thought Pierre, and the whole of
28846. this general deception which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to
28847. it, astonished him each time as if it were something new. "I understand
28848. the deception and confusion," he thought, "but how am I to tell them
28849. all that I see? I have tried, and have always found that they too in the
28850. depths of their souls understand it as I do, and only try not to see
28851. it. So it appears that it must be so! But I--what is to become of
28852. me?" thought he. He had the unfortunate capacity many men, especially
28853. Russians, have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness
28854. and truth, but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly
28855. to be able to take a serious part in it. Every sphere of work was
28856. connected, in his eyes, with evil and deception. Whatever he tried to
28857. be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him
28858. and blocked every path of activity. Yet he had to live and to find
28859. occupation. It was too dreadful to be under the burden of these
28860. insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order
28861. to forget them. He frequented every kind of society, drank much, bought
28862. pictures, engaged in building, and above all--read.
28863. 
28864. He read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home, while
28865. his valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book and
28866. began to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping to
28867. gossip in drawing rooms of the Club, from gossip to carousals and women;
28868. from carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking became more
28869. and more a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the doctors
28870. warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him, he
28871. drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having poured several
28872. glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant
28873. warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his fellows, and a
28874. readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it
28875. deeply. Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the
28876. terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was
28877. not as dreadful as he had thought. He was always conscious of some
28878. aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or
28879. supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read. But under the
28880. influence of wine he said to himself: "It doesn't matter. I'll get it
28881. unraveled. I have a solution ready, but have no time now--I'll think it
28882. all out later on!" But the later on never came.
28883. 
28884. In the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions appeared as
28885. insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily picked up a book, and
28886. if anyone came to see him he was glad.
28887. 
28888. Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when
28889. entrenched under the enemy's fire, if they have nothing to do, try hard
28890. to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To Pierre
28891. all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life: some in
28892. ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women, some in
28893. toys, some in horses, some in politics, some in sport, some in wine,
28894. and some in governmental affairs. "Nothing is trivial, and nothing is
28895. important, it's all the same--only to save oneself from it as best one
28896. can," thought Pierre. "Only not to see it, that dreadful it!"
28897. 
28898. 
28899. 
28900. 
28901. 
28902. CHAPTER II
28903. 
28904. 
28905. At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolkonski and his daughter
28906. moved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor Alexander's
28907. regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French tendency prevailed
28908. there, and this, together with his past and his intellect and his
28909. originality, at once made Prince Nicholas Bolkonski an object of
28910. particular respect to the Moscovites and the center of the Moscow
28911. opposition to the government.
28912. 
28913. The prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of
28914. senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent
28915. events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which
28916. he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of this
28917. the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful
28918. veneration--especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his
28919. old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone, told his
28920. abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing
28921. criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned house with
28922. its gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered footmen, and
28923. the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his
28924. gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted
28925. to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visitors
28926. did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw
28927. their host, there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the
28928. private and intimate life of the house continued.
28929. 
28930. Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary.
28931. There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures--talks with
28932. the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills--and she
28933. had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not go
28934. out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her go
28935. anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going out
28936. himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties. She
28937. had quite abandoned the hope of getting married. She saw the coldness
28938. and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the
28939. young men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house. She
28940. had no friends: during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in
28941. the two who had been nearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom
28942. she had never been able to be quite frank, had now become unpleasant to
28943. her, and for various reasons Princess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom
28944. she had corresponded for the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved
28945. to be quite alien to her when they met. Just then Julie, who by the
28946. death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow,
28947. was in the full whirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young
28948. men who, she fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth.
28949. Julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels
28950. that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be
28951. decided now or never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a
28952. mournful smile that she now had no one to write to, since Julie--whose
28953. presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like
28954. the old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his
28955. evenings for years, she regretted Julie's presence and having no one to
28956. write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one to whom
28957. to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just then. The
28958. time for Prince Andrew's return and marriage was approaching, but his
28959. request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out; in
28960. fact, it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless, for at every mention
28961. of the young Countess Rostova the old prince (who apart from that was
28962. usually in a bad temper) lost control of himself. Another lately added
28963. sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old nephew. To her
28964. consternation she detected in herself in relation to little Nicholas
28965. some symptoms of her father's irritability. However often she told
28966. herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew, almost
28967. every time that, pointer in hand, she sat down to show him the French
28968. alphabet, she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily
28969. into the child--who was already afraid that Auntie might at any moment
28970. get angry--that at his slightest inattention she trembled, became
28971. flustered and heated, raised her voice, and sometimes pulled him by the
28972. arm and put him in the corner. Having put him in the corner she would
28973. herself begin to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little Nicholas,
28974. following her example, would sob, and without permission would leave his
28975. corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and comfort
28976. her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her father's
28977. irritability, which was always directed against her and had of late
28978. amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the
28979. ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water, it
28980. would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but this
28981. loving despot--the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason
28982. tormented himself and her--knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate
28983. her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame for
28984. everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented Princess
28985. Mary more than anything else; this was his ever-increasing intimacy with
28986. Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at the first moment of receiving
28987. the news of his son's intentions had occurred to him in jest--that
28988. if Andrew got married he himself would marry Bourienne--had evidently
28989. pleased him, and latterly he had persistently, and as it seemed to
28990. Princess Mary merely to offend her, shown special endearments to
28991. the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by
28992. demonstrations of love of Bourienne.
28993. 
28994. One day in Moscow in Princess Mary's presence (she thought her father
28995. did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle
28996. Bourienne's hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately.
28997. Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few minutes later
28998. Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary's room smiling and making
28999. cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily wiped
29000. away her tears, went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne, and
29001. evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry
29002. haste at the Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: "It's horrible, vile,
29003. inhuman, to take advantage of the weakness..." She did not finish.
29004. "Leave my room," she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.
29005. 
29006. Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed
29007. that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be
29008. served first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from
29009. habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew furious,
29010. threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to have him
29011. conscripted for the army.
29012. 
29013. "He doesn't obey... I said it twice... and he doesn't obey! She is the
29014. first person in this house; she's my best friend," cried the prince.
29015. "And if you allow yourself," he screamed in a fury, addressing Princess
29016. Mary for the first time, "to forget yourself again before her as you
29017. dared to do yesterday, I will show you who is master in this house. Go!
29018. Don't let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!"
29019. 
29020. Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne's pardon, and also her
29021. father's pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged
29022. for her intervention.
29023. 
29024. At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her
29025. soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his
29026. spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or
29027. would forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step with
29028. his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness,
29029. or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him
29030. would suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking head
29031. sink over his plate. "He is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn
29032. him!" she thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against
29033. herself.
29034. 
29035. 
29036. 
29037. 
29038. 
29039. CHAPTER III
29040. 
29041. 
29042. In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor--Metivier--who had
29043. rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, amiable
29044. as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily clever
29045. doctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but
29046. as an equal.
29047. 
29048. Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on
29049. Mademoiselle Bourienne's advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and
29050. had grown accustomed to him. Metivier came to see the prince about twice
29051. a week.
29052. 
29053. On December 6--St. Nicholas' Day and the prince's name day--all Moscow
29054. came to the prince's front door but he gave orders to admit no one
29055. and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave to
29056. Princess Mary.
29057. 
29058. Metivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered
29059. it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne, * as he told
29060. Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on that
29061. morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods. He had
29062. been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone
29063. and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be
29064. understood himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed
29065. querulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage, and she
29066. went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and
29067. awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctor's arrival the morning
29068. had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor, Princess Mary sat
29069. down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she
29070. could hear all that passed in the study.
29071. 
29072. 
29073.     * To force the guard.
29074. 
29075. 
29076. At first she heard only Metivier's voice, then her father's, then both
29077. voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open, and
29078. on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified Metivier
29079. with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing gown and
29080. fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled
29081. downwards.
29082. 
29083. "You don't understand?" shouted the prince, "but I do! French spy, slave
29084. of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell you..."
29085. 
29086. Metivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne who
29087. at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.
29088. 
29089. "The prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head.
29090. Keep calm, I will call again tomorrow," said Metivier; and putting his
29091. fingers to his lips he hastened away.
29092. 
29093. Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:
29094. "Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment's peace in my own
29095. house!"
29096. 
29097. After Metivier's departure the old prince called his daughter in, and
29098. the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a spy
29099. had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list,
29100. and not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was that
29101. scoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he said, he
29102. could not have a moment's peace and could not die quietly.
29103. 
29104. "No, ma'am! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand
29105. it! I cannot endure any more," he said, and left the room. Then, as if
29106. afraid she might find some means of consolation, he returned and trying
29107. to appear calm added: "And don't imagine I have said this in a moment of
29108. anger. I am calm. I have thought it over, and it will be carried
29109. out--we must part; so find some place for yourself...." But he could not
29110. restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves
29111. is capable, evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at her and
29112. screamed:
29113. 
29114. "If only some fool would marry her!" Then he slammed the door, sent for
29115. Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.
29116. 
29117. At two o'clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.
29118. 
29119. These guests--the famous Count Rostopchin, Prince Lopukhin with his
29120. nephew, General Chatrov an old war comrade of the prince's, and of the
29121. younger generation Pierre and Boris Drubetskoy--awaited the prince in
29122. the drawing room.
29123. 
29124. Boris, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been
29125. anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, and had contrived
29126. to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an
29127. exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house.
29128. 
29129. The prince's house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
29130. society, but his little circle--though not much talked about in
29131. town--was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other.
29132. Boris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief
29133. in his presence invited Rostopchin to dinner on St. Nicholas' Day, and
29134. Rostopchin had replied that he could not come:
29135. 
29136. "On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince
29137. Nicholas Bolkonski."
29138. 
29139. "Oh, yes, yes!" replied the commander in chief. "How is he?..."
29140. 
29141. The small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old-fashioned
29142. drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of
29143. a court of justice. All were silent or talked in low tones. Prince
29144. Nicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary seemed even quieter
29145. and more diffident than usual. The guests were reluctant to address her,
29146. feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation. Count Rostopchin
29147. alone kept the conversation going, now relating the latest town news,
29148. and now the latest political gossip.
29149. 
29150. Lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation.
29151. Prince Bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives a report, only
29152. now and then, silently or by a brief word, showing that he took heed of
29153. what was being reported to him. The tone of the conversation was such as
29154. indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political
29155. world. Incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that
29156. everything was going from bad to worse, but whether telling a story or
29157. giving an opinion the speaker always stopped, or was stopped, at the
29158. point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself.
29159. 
29160. At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon's
29161. seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg's territory, and the Russian Note,
29162. hostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.
29163. 
29164. "Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel," said Count
29165. Rostopchin, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before. "One
29166. only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the crowned heads.
29167. Now the Pope's turn has come and Bonaparte doesn't scruple to depose the
29168. head of the Catholic Church--yet all keep silent! Our sovereign alone
29169. has protested against the seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg's territory,
29170. and even..." Count Rostopchin paused, feeling that he had reached the
29171. limit beyond which censure was impossible.
29172. 
29173. "Other territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of
29174. Oldenburg," said Prince Bolkonski. "He shifts the Dukes about as I might
29175. move my serfs from Bald Hills to Bogucharovo or my Ryazan estates."
29176. 
29177. "The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of
29178. character and resignation," remarked Boris, joining in respectfully.
29179. 
29180. He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor
29181. of being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolkonski glanced at the young
29182. man as if about to say something in reply, but changed his mind,
29183. evidently considering him too young.
29184. 
29185. "I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised
29186. how badly the Note was worded," remarked Count Rostopchin in the casual
29187. tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.
29188. 
29189. Pierre looked at Rostopchin with naive astonishment, not understanding
29190. why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note.
29191. 
29192. "Does it matter, Count, how the Note is worded," he asked, "so long as
29193. its substance is forcible?"
29194. 
29195. "My dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy
29196. to have a good style," returned Count Rostopchin.
29197. 
29198. Pierre now understood the count's dissatisfaction with the wording of
29199. the Note.
29200. 
29201. "One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up," remarked
29202. the old prince. "There in Petersburg they are always writing--not notes
29203. only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written a whole volume
29204. of laws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!" and he laughed
29205. unnaturally.
29206. 
29207. There was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general cleared
29208. his throat to draw attention.
29209. 
29210. "Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The figure
29211. cut by the new French ambassador."
29212. 
29213. "Eh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His Majesty's
29214. presence."
29215. 
29216. "His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march
29217. past," continued the general, "and it seems the ambassador took no
29218. notice and allowed himself to reply that: 'We in France pay no attention
29219. to such trifles!' The Emperor did not condescend to reply. At the next
29220. review, they say, the Emperor did not once deign to address him."
29221. 
29222. All were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it was
29223. impossible to pass any judgment.
29224. 
29225. "Impudent fellows!" said the prince. "You know Metivier? I turned him
29226. out of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in spite of
29227. my request that they should let no one in," he went on, glancing angrily
29228. at his daughter.
29229. 
29230. And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and the
29231. reasons that convinced him that Metivier was a spy. Though these reasons
29232. were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.
29233. 
29234. After the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to congratulate
29235. the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.
29236. 
29237. He gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled,
29238. clean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told her
29239. that he had not forgotten the morning's talk, that his decision remained
29240. in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it
29241. to her now.
29242. 
29243. When they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the old
29244. men sat together.
29245. 
29246. Prince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the
29247. impending war.
29248. 
29249. He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we
29250. sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European
29251. affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit. "We ought
29252. not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political interests are
29253. all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing is to have
29254. an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will never dare to cross the
29255. Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!"
29256. 
29257. "How can we fight the French, Prince?" said Count Rostopchin. "Can we
29258. arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at our youths,
29259. look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our Kingdom of
29260. Heaven."
29261. 
29262. He began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.
29263. 
29264. "French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned
29265. Metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and a
29266. scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees. I went to
29267. a party last night, and there out of five ladies three were Roman
29268. Catholics and had the Pope's indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays.
29269. And they themselves sit there nearly naked, like the signboards at our
29270. Public Baths if I may say so. Ah, when one looks at our young people,
29271. Prince, one would like to take Peter the Great's old cudgel out of the
29272. museum and belabor them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps
29273. out of them."
29274. 
29275. All were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopchin with a smile and
29276. wagged his head approvingly.
29277. 
29278. "Well, good-by, your excellency, keep well!" said Rostopchin, getting up
29279. with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince.
29280. 
29281. "Good-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of
29282. hearing him!" said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and offering
29283. his cheek to be kissed.
29284. 
29285. Following Rostopchin's example the others also rose.
29286. 
29287. 
29288. 
29289. 
29290. 
29291. CHAPTER IV
29292. 
29293. 
29294. Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old men's talk and
29295. faultfinding, understood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered
29296. whether the guests had all observed her father's hostile attitude toward
29297. her. She did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities
29298. shown her during dinner by Boris Drubetskoy, who was visiting them for
29299. the third time already.
29300. 
29301. Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre, who
29302. hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to
29303. approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone
29304. in the drawing room.
29305. 
29306. "May I stay a little longer?" he said, letting his stout body sink into
29307. an armchair beside her.
29308. 
29309. "Oh yes," she answered. "You noticed nothing?" her look asked.
29310. 
29311. Pierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight before
29312. him and smiled quietly.
29313. 
29314. "Have you known that young man long, Princess?" he asked.
29315. 
29316. "Who?"
29317. 
29318. "Drubetskoy."
29319. 
29320. "No, not long..."
29321. 
29322. "Do you like him?"
29323. 
29324. "Yes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?" said
29325. Princess Mary, still thinking of that morning's conversation with her
29326. father.
29327. 
29328. "Because I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from
29329. Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an
29330. heiress."
29331. 
29332. "You have observed that?" said Princess Mary.
29333. 
29334. "Yes," returned Pierre with a smile, "and this young man now manages
29335. matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too. I
29336. can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay siege
29337. to--you or Mademoiselle Julie Karagina. He is very attentive to her."
29338. 
29339. "He visits them?"
29340. 
29341. "Yes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?" said Pierre
29342. with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored
29343. raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary.
29344. 
29345. "No," replied Princess Mary.
29346. 
29347. "To please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is very
29348. melancholy with Mademoiselle Karagina," said Pierre.
29349. 
29350. "Really?" asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierre's kindly face and
29351. still thinking of her own sorrow. "It would be a relief," thought she,
29352. "if I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone. I should like
29353. to tell everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It would be a
29354. relief. He would give me advice."
29355. 
29356. "Would you marry him?"
29357. 
29358. "Oh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!" she
29359. cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice. "Ah, how
29360. bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that..." she went
29361. on in a trembling voice, "that you can do nothing for him but grieve
29362. him, and to know that you cannot alter this. Then there is only one
29363. thing left--to go away, but where could I go?"
29364. 
29365. "What is wrong? What is it, Princess?"
29366. 
29367. But without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into
29368. tears.
29369. 
29370. "I don't know what is the matter with me today. Don't take any
29371. notice--forget what I have said!"
29372. 
29373. Pierre's gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the
29374. princess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but
29375. she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that
29376. she did not remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble
29377. except the one he knew of--that Prince Andrew's marriage threatened to
29378. cause a rupture between father and son.
29379. 
29380. "Have you any news of the Rostovs?" she asked, to change the subject.
29381. "I was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew any day. I
29382. should like them to meet here."
29383. 
29384. "And how does he now regard the matter?" asked Pierre, referring to the
29385. old prince.
29386. 
29387. Princess Mary shook her head.
29388. 
29389. "What is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The thing is
29390. impossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments. I
29391. wish they would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her. You have
29392. known them a long time," said Princess Mary. "Tell me honestly the whole
29393. truth: what sort of girl is she, and what do you think of her?--The real
29394. truth, because you know Andrew is risking so much doing this against his
29395. father's will that I should like to know..."
29396. 
29397. An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and repeated
29398. requests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on the
29399. princess' part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that he should
29400. disapprove of Andrew's choice; but in reply he said what he felt rather
29401. than what he thought.
29402. 
29403. "I don't know how to answer your question," he said, blushing without
29404. knowing why. "I really don't know what sort of girl she is; I can't
29405. analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I don't
29406. know. That is all one can say about her."
29407. 
29408. Princess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: "Yes, that's
29409. what I expected and feared."
29410. 
29411. "Is she clever?" she asked.
29412. 
29413. Pierre considered.
29414. 
29415. "I think not," he said, "and yet--yes. She does not deign to be
29416. clever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all."
29417. 
29418. Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.
29419. 
29420. "Ah, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do."
29421. 
29422. "I hear they are expected very soon," said Pierre.
29423. 
29424. Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future
29425. sister-in-law as soon as the Rostovs arrived and to try to accustom the
29426. old prince to her.
29427. 
29428. 
29429. 
29430. 
29431. 
29432. CHAPTER V
29433. 
29434. 
29435. Boris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg, so with
29436. the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered between the
29437. two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though Princess Mary
29438. despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie, he,
29439. without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to her. When they
29440. had last met on the old prince's name day, she had answered at random
29441. all his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently not listening to what
29442. he was saying.
29443. 
29444. Julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a
29445. manner peculiar to herself.
29446. 
29447. She was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become
29448. very wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself not
29449. merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She
29450. was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very
29451. wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less
29452. dangerous she became to men, and the more freely they could associate
29453. with her and avail themselves of her suppers, soirees, and the animated
29454. company that assembled at her house, without incurring any obligation.
29455. A man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day
29456. to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of
29457. compromising her and committing himself, would now go boldly every day
29458. and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.
29459. 
29460. That winter the Karagins' house was the most agreeable and hospitable
29461. in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties, a large
29462. company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day, supping at midnight
29463. and staying till three in the morning. Julie never missed a ball, a
29464. promenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of the latest fashion.
29465. But in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and
29466. told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in
29467. love, or any of the joys of life, and expected peace only "yonder." She
29468. adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment, like a
29469. girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by
29470. him. Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in
29471. that light, and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered
29472. much in life. This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing
29473. herself, did not hinder the young people who came to her house from
29474. passing the time pleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid
29475. his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused
29476. himself with society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts
29477. rimes, which were in vogue at the Karagins'. Only a few of these young
29478. men, among them Boris, entered more deeply into Julie's melancholy, and
29479. with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity
29480. of all worldly things, and to them she showed her albums filled with
29481. mournful sketches, maxims, and verses.
29482. 
29483. To Boris, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early
29484. disillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of friendship
29485. as she who had herself suffered so much could render, and showed him her
29486. album. Boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote: "Rustic trees,
29487. your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me."
29488. 
29489. On another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:
29490. 
29491.     La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.
29492.     Ah! contre les douleurs il n'y a pas d'autre asile. *
29493. 
29494. 
29495.     * Death gives relief and death is peaceful.
29496. 
29497. 
29498. Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.
29499. 
29500. Julie said this was charming
29501. 
29502. "There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy," she said
29503. to Boris, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book.
29504. "It is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness and
29505. despair, showing the possibility of consolation."
29506. 
29507. In reply Boris wrote these lines:
29508. 
29509.     Aliment de poison d'une ame trop sensible,
29510.     Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,
29511.     Tendre melancholie, ah, viens me consoler,
29512.     Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,
29513.     Et mele une douceur secrete
29514.     A ces pleurs que je sens couler. *
29515. 
29516. 
29517.       *Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,
29518.      Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,
29519.      Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,
29520.      Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,
29521.      And mingle a secret sweetness
29522.      With these tears that I feel to be flowing.
29523. 
29524. 
29525. For Boris, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. Boris read
29526. Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the reading
29527. because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large gatherings
29528. Julie and Boris looked on one another as the only souls who understood
29529. one another in a world of indifferent people.
29530. 
29531. Anna Mikhaylovna, who often visited the Karagins, while playing cards
29532. with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie's dowry (she was to
29533. have two estates in Penza and the Nizhegorod forests). Anna Mikhaylovna
29534. regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy Julie
29535. with emotion, and resignation to the Divine will.
29536. 
29537. "You are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie," she said to
29538. the daughter. "Boris says his soul finds repose at your house. He has
29539. suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive," said she to the
29540. mother. "Ah, my dear, I can't tell you how fond I have grown of Julie
29541. latterly," she said to her son. "But who could help loving her? She is
29542. an angelic being! Ah, Boris, Boris!"--she paused. "And how I pity her
29543. mother," she went on; "today she showed me her accounts and letters from
29544. Penza (they have enormous estates there), and she, poor thing, has no
29545. one to help her, and they do cheat her so!"
29546. 
29547. Boris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother. He
29548. laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had
29549. to say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the Penza and
29550. Nizhegorod estates.
29551. 
29552. Julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and
29553. was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of repulsion for her,
29554. for her passionate desire to get married, for her artificiality, and
29555. a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still
29556. restrained Boris. His leave was expiring. He spent every day and whole
29557. days at the Karagins', and every day on thinking the matter over told
29558. himself that he would propose tomorrow. But in Julie's presence, looking
29559. at her red face and chin (nearly always powdered), her moist eyes, and
29560. her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy
29561. to an unnatural rapture of married bliss, Boris could not utter the
29562. decisive words, though in imagination he had long regarded himself as
29563. the possessor of those Penza and Nizhegorod estates and had apportioned
29564. the use of the income from them. Julie saw Boris' indecision, and
29565. sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him, but
29566. her feminine self-deception immediately supplied her with consolation,
29567. and she told herself that he was only shy from love. Her melancholy,
29568. however, began to turn to irritability, and not long before Boris'
29569. departure she formed a definite plan of action. Just as Boris' leave of
29570. absence was expiring, Anatole Kuragin made his appearance in Moscow, and
29571. of course in the Karagins' drawing room, and Julie, suddenly abandoning
29572. her melancholy, became cheerful and very attentive to Kuragin.
29573. 
29574. "My dear," said Anna Mikhaylovna to her son, "I know from a reliable
29575. source that Prince Vasili has sent his son to Moscow to get him married
29576. to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for her. What do
29577. you think of it, my dear?"
29578. 
29579. The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole
29580. month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all the
29581. revenue from the Penza estates which he had already mentally apportioned
29582. and put to proper use fall into the hands of another, and especially
29583. into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained Boris. He drove to the
29584. Karagins' with the firm intention of proposing. Julie met him in a gay,
29585. careless manner, spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterday's ball,
29586. and asked when he was leaving. Though Boris had come intentionally to
29587. speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender, he began speaking
29588. irritably of feminine inconstancy, of how easily women can turn from
29589. sadness to joy, and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be
29590. paying court to them. Julie was offended and replied that it was true
29591. that a woman needs variety, and the same thing over and over again would
29592. weary anyone.
29593. 
29594. "Then I should advise you..." Boris began, wishing to sting her; but at
29595. that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to
29596. leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have vainly wasted
29597. his efforts--which was a thing he never allowed to happen.
29598. 
29599. He checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes to
29600. avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and said:
29601. 
29602. "I did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary..."
29603. 
29604. He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability had
29605. suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were fixed on
29606. him with greedy expectation. "I can always arrange so as not to see her
29607. often," thought Boris. "The affair has been begun and must be finished!"
29608. He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and said:
29609. 
29610. "You know my feelings for you!"
29611. 
29612. There was no need to say more: Julie's face shone with triumph and
29613. self-satisfaction; but she forced Boris to say all that is said on such
29614. occasions--that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more
29615. than her. She knew that for the Penza estates and Nizhegorod forests she
29616. could demand this, and she received what she demanded.
29617. 
29618. The affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and
29619. melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house in
29620. Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding.
29621. 
29622. 
29623. 
29624. 
29625. 
29626. CHAPTER VI
29627. 
29628. 
29629. At the end of January old Count Rostov went to Moscow with Natasha and
29630. Sonya. The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was
29631. impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in
29632. Moscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near
29633. Moscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his
29634. future daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkonski while he was in Moscow
29635. could not be missed. The Rostovs' Moscow house had not been heated that
29636. winter and, as they had come only for a short time and the countess
29637. was not with them, the count decided to stay with Marya Dmitrievna
29638. Akhrosimova, who had long been pressing her hospitality on them.
29639. 
29640. Late one evening the Rostovs' four sleighs drove into Marya Dmitrievna's
29641. courtyard in the old Konyusheny street. Marya Dmitrievna lived alone.
29642. She had already married off her daughter, and her sons were all in the
29643. service.
29644. 
29645. She held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,
29646. loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach
29647. to others for any weakness, passion, or temptation--the possibility of
29648. which she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing
29649. jacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out:
29650. on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on
29651. affairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after
29652. dressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there
29653. were always some. Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal
29654. at which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she played
29655. a game of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read
29656. to her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception and went out to
29657. pay visits, and then only to the most important persons in the town.
29658. 
29659. She had not yet gone to bed when the Rostovs arrived and the pulley of
29660. the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the Rostovs and their
29661. servants. Marya Dmitrievna, with her spectacles hanging down on her nose
29662. and her head flung back, stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern,
29663. grim face at the new arrivals. One might have thought she was angry with
29664. the travelers and would immediately turn them out, had she not at the
29665. same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the
29666. accommodation of the visitors and their belongings.
29667. 
29668. "The count's things? Bring them here," she said, pointing to the
29669. portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. "The young ladies'? There to the
29670. left. Now what are you dawdling for?" she cried to the maids. "Get the
29671. samovar ready!... You've grown plumper and prettier," she remarked,
29672. drawing Natasha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to her by the
29673. hood. "Foo! You are cold! Now take off your things, quick!" she shouted
29674. to the count who was going to kiss her hand. "You're half frozen,
29675. I'm sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour, Sonya dear!" she added,
29676. turning to Sonya and indicating by this French greeting her slightly
29677. contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her.
29678. 
29679. When they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things and
29680. tidied themselves up after their journey, Marya Dmitrievna kissed them
29681. all in due order.
29682. 
29683. "I'm heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was high
29684. time," she said, giving Natasha a significant look. "The old man is here
29685. and his son's expected any day. You'll have to make his acquaintance.
29686. But we'll speak of that later on," she added, glancing at Sonya with a
29687. look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her presence. "Now
29688. listen," she said to the count. "What do you want tomorrow? Whom will
29689. you send for? Shinshin?" she crooked one of her fingers. "The sniveling
29690. Anna Mikhaylovna? That's two. She's here with her son. The son is
29691. getting married! Then Bezukhov, eh? He is here too, with his wife. He
29692. ran away from her and she came galloping after him. He dined with me on
29693. Wednesday. As for them"--and she pointed to the girls--"tomorrow I'll
29694. take them first to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God, and then
29695. we'll drive to the Super-Rogue's. I suppose you'll have everything new.
29696. Don't judge by me: sleeves nowadays are this size! The other day young
29697. Princess Irina Vasilevna came to see me; she was an awful sight--looked
29698. as if she had put two barrels on her arms. You know not a day passes
29699. now without some new fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?" she
29700. asked the count sternly.
29701. 
29702. "One thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a
29703. purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If you
29704. will be so kind, I'll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a
29705. day, and leave my lassies with you."
29706. 
29707. "All right. All right. They'll be safe with me, as safe as in Chancery!
29708. I'll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and pet them a
29709. bit," said Marya Dmitrievna, touching her goddaughter and favorite,
29710. Natasha, on the cheek with her large hand.
29711. 
29712. Next morning Marya Dmitrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian
29713. shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so
29714. afraid of Marya Dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at a
29715. loss merely to get rid of her. Marya Dmitrievna ordered almost the
29716. whole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the room
29717. except Natasha, and then called her pet to her armchair.
29718. 
29719. "Well, now we'll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed. You've
29720. hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I've known him since
29721. he was so high." She held her hand a couple of feet from the ground.
29722. Natasha blushed happily. "I like him and all his family. Now listen! You
29723. know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son's marrying. The old
29724. fellow's crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can shift
29725. without him, but it's not nice to enter a family against a father's
29726. will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly. You're a clever girl
29727. and you'll know how to manage. Be kind, and use your wits. Then all will
29728. be well."
29729. 
29730. Natasha remained silent, from shyness Marya Dmitrievna supposed, but
29731. really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love
29732. of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs
29733. that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he
29734. loved her only, and was to come one of these days and take her. She
29735. wanted nothing more.
29736. 
29737. "You see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your
29738. future sister-in-law. 'Husbands' sisters bring up blisters,' but this
29739. one wouldn't hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two together.
29740. Tomorrow you'll go with your father to see her. Be very nice and
29741. affectionate to her: you're younger than she. When he comes, he'll find
29742. you already know his sister and father and are liked by them. Am I right
29743. or not? Won't that be best?"
29744. 
29745. "Yes, it will," Natasha answered reluctantly.
29746. 
29747. 
29748. 
29749. 
29750. 
29751. CHAPTER VII
29752. 
29753. 
29754. Next day, by Marya Dmitrievna's advice, Count Rostov took Natasha to
29755. call on Prince Nicholas Bolkonski. The count did not set out cheerfully
29756. on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well remembered the last
29757. interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment,
29758. when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an
29759. angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men. Natasha,
29760. on the other hand, having put on her best gown, was in the highest
29761. spirits. "They can't help liking me," she thought. "Everybody always has
29762. liked me, and I am so willing to do anything they wish, so ready to
29763. be fond of him--for being his father--and of her--for being his
29764. sister--that there is no reason for them not to like me..."
29765. 
29766. They drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdvizhenka and entered
29767. the vestibule.
29768. 
29769. "Well, the Lord have mercy on us!" said the count, half in jest, half
29770. in earnest; but Natasha noticed that her father was flurried on entering
29771. the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and
29772. princess were at home.
29773. 
29774. When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
29775. servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
29776. another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a
29777. maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning
29778. the princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced
29779. to the Rostovs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess
29780. begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors
29781. was Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and daughter with
29782. special politeness and showed them to the princess' room. The princess,
29783. looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in patches, ran in to meet
29784. the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly trying to appear cordial and
29785. at ease. From the first glance Princess Mary did not like Natasha. She
29786. thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and vain. She did
29787. not at all realize that before having seen her future sister-in-law she
29788. was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty, youth, and
29789. happiness, as well as by jealousy of her brother's love for her. Apart
29790. from this insuperable antipathy to her, Princess Mary was agitated just
29791. then because on the Rostovs' being announced, the old prince had shouted
29792. that he did not wish to see them, that Princess Mary might do so if
29793. she chose, but they were not to be admitted to him. She had decided to
29794. receive them, but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in
29795. some freak, as he seemed much upset by the Rostovs' visit.
29796. 
29797. "There, my dear princess, I've brought you my songstress," said the
29798. count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince
29799. might appear. "I am so glad you should get to know one another... very
29800. sorry the prince is still ailing," and after a few more commonplace
29801. remarks he rose. "If you'll allow me to leave my Natasha in your
29802. hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, I'll drive round to see Anna
29803. Semenovna, it's quite near in the Dogs' Square, and then I'll come back
29804. for her."
29805. 
29806. The count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his
29807. daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk
29808. to one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of
29809. encountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention
29810. this to his daughter, but Natasha noticed her father's nervousness
29811. and anxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still
29812. angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and
29813. defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody. The
29814. princess told the count that she would be delighted, and only begged him
29815. to stay longer at Anna Semenovna's, and he departed.
29816. 
29817. Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary--who wished to
29818. have a tete-a-tete with Natasha--Mademoiselle Bourienne remained in
29819. the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and theaters.
29820. Natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom,
29821. by her father's nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of the princess
29822. who--she thought--was making a favor of receiving her, and so everything
29823. displeased her. She did not like Princess Mary, whom she thought very
29824. plain, affected, and dry. Natasha suddenly shrank into herself and
29825. involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated Princess Mary still
29826. more. After five minutes of irksome, constrained conversation, they
29827. heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching. Princess Mary
29828. looked frightened.
29829. 
29830. The door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white
29831. nightcap, came in.
29832. 
29833. "Ah, madam!" he began. "Madam, Countess... Countess Rostova, if I am
29834. not mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not know,
29835. madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with a
29836. visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg
29837. you to excuse me... God is my witness, I didn't know-" he repeated,
29838. stressing the word "God" so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
29839. Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
29840. father or at Natasha.
29841. 
29842. Nor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.
29843. Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.
29844. 
29845. "I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not know,"
29846. muttered the old man, and after looking Natasha over from head to foot
29847. he went out.
29848. 
29849. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
29850. apparition and began speaking about the prince's indisposition. Natasha
29851. and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the longer they
29852. did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater grew their
29853. antipathy to one another.
29854. 
29855. When the count returned, Natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened
29856. to get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who
29857. could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
29858. hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. "I couldn't begin
29859. talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman," thought Natasha.
29860. The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary. She knew what
29861. she ought to have said to Natasha, but she had been unable to say it
29862. because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and because, without
29863. knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage. When
29864. the count was already leaving the room, Princess Mary went up hurriedly
29865. to Natasha, took her by the hand, and said with a deep sigh:
29866. 
29867. "Wait, I must..."
29868. 
29869. Natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.
29870. 
29871. "Dear Natalie," said Princess Mary, "I want you to know that I am glad
29872. my brother has found happiness...."
29873. 
29874. She paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. Natasha noticed
29875. this and guessed its reason.
29876. 
29877. "I think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now," she said
29878. with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears choking
29879. her.
29880. 
29881. "What have I said and what have I done?" thought she, as soon as she was
29882. out of the room.
29883. 
29884. They waited a long time for Natasha to come to dinner that day. She sat
29885. in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. Sonya
29886. stood beside her, kissing her hair.
29887. 
29888. "Natasha, what is it about?" she asked. "What do they matter to you? It
29889. will all pass, Natasha."
29890. 
29891. "But if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I..."
29892. 
29893. "Don't talk about it, Natasha. It wasn't your fault so why should you
29894. mind? Kiss me," said Sonya.
29895. 
29896. Natasha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed her
29897. wet face against her.
29898. 
29899. "I can't tell you, I don't know. No one's to blame," said Natasha--"It's
29900. my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why doesn't he come?..."
29901. 
29902. She came in to dinner with red eyes. Marya Dmitrievna, who knew how
29903. the prince had received the Rostovs, pretended not to notice how upset
29904. Natasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and
29905. the other guests.
29906. 
29907. 
29908. 
29909. 
29910. 
29911. CHAPTER VIII
29912. 
29913. 
29914. That evening the Rostovs went to the Opera, for which Marya Dmitrievna
29915. had taken a box.
29916. 
29917. Natasha did not want to go, but could not refuse Marya Dmitrievna's kind
29918. offer which was intended expressly for her. When she came ready dressed
29919. into the ballroom to await her father, and looking in the large mirror
29920. there saw that she was pretty, very pretty, she felt even more sad, but
29921. it was a sweet, tender sadness.
29922. 
29923. "O God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but
29924. differently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply
29925. embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those searching
29926. inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me, and then I would
29927. make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes--how I see those eyes!"
29928. thought Natasha. "And what do his father and sister matter to me? I
29929. love him alone, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with his smile,
29930. manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not think of him; not think
29931. of him but forget him, quite forget him for the present. I can't bear
29932. this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!" and she turned away from the
29933. glass, making an effort not to cry. "And how can Sonya love Nicholas
29934. so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently?" thought she,
29935. looking at Sonya, who also came in quite ready, with a fan in her hand.
29936. "No, she's altogether different. I can't!"
29937. 
29938. Natasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not
29939. enough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at
29940. once, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words of
29941. love such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside her
29942. father, pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on
29943. the frozen window, she felt still sadder and more in love, and forgot
29944. where she was going and with whom. Having fallen into the line of
29945. carriages, the Rostovs' carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels
29946. squeaking over the snow. Natasha and Sonya, holding up their dresses,
29947. jumped out quickly. The count got out helped by the footmen, and,
29948. passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers,
29949. they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes.
29950. Through the closed doors the music was already audible.
29951. 
29952. "Natasha, your hair!..." whispered Sonya.
29953. 
29954. An attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
29955. opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the
29956. door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
29957. shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before
29958. their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy
29959. at Natasha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being
29960. played. Natasha, smoothing her gown, went in with Sonya and sat down,
29961. scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sensation she had not
29962. experienced for a long time--that of hundreds of eyes looking at
29963. her bare arms and neck--suddenly affected her both agreeably and
29964. disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories, desires and
29965. emotions associated with that feeling.
29966. 
29967. The two remarkably pretty girls, Natasha and Sonya, with Count Rostov
29968. who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted general
29969. attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Natasha's engagement to
29970. Prince Andrew, and knew that the Rostovs had lived in the country ever
29971. since, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who was making one of
29972. the best matches in Russia.
29973. 
29974. Natasha's looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the country, and
29975. that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty. She
29976. struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty, combined
29977. with her indifference to everything about her. Her black eyes looked at
29978. the crowd without seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare to
29979. above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently
29980. unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in time to the music,
29981. crumpling her program. "Look, there's Alenina," said Sonya, "with her
29982. mother, isn't it?"
29983. 
29984. "Dear me, Michael Kirilovich has grown still stouter!" remarked the
29985. count.
29986. 
29987. "Look at our Anna Mikhaylovna--what a headdress she has on!"
29988. 
29989. "The Karagins, Julie--and Boris with them. One can see at once that
29990. they're engaged...."
29991. 
29992. "Drubetskoy has proposed?"
29993. 
29994. "Oh yes, I heard it today," said Shinshin, coming into the Rostovs' box.
29995. 
29996. Natasha looked in the direction in which her father's eyes were turned
29997. and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face
29998. and a string of pearls round her thick red neck--which Natasha knew was
29999. covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning over with
30000. an ear to Julie's mouth, was Boris' handsome smoothly brushed head. He
30001. looked at the Rostovs from under his brows and said something, smiling,
30002. to his betrothed.
30003. 
30004. "They are talking about us, about me and him!" thought Natasha. "And he
30005. no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn't trouble themselves!
30006. If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of them."
30007. 
30008. Behind them sat Anna Mikhaylovna wearing a green headdress and with a
30009. happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their box was
30010. pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which Natasha knew so
30011. well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly remembered all that
30012. had been so humiliating in her morning's visit.
30013. 
30014. "What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh, better
30015. not think of it--not till he comes back!" she told herself, and began
30016. looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in the stalls. In
30017. the front, in the very center, leaning back against the orchestra rail,
30018. stood Dolokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair brushed up into a huge
30019. shock. He stood in full view of the audience, well aware that he was
30020. attracting everyone's attention, yet as much at ease as though he were
30021. in his own room. Around him thronged Moscow's most brilliant young men,
30022. whom he evidently dominated.
30023. 
30024. The count, laughing, nudged the blushing Sonya and pointed to her former
30025. adorer.
30026. 
30027. "Do you recognize him?" said he. "And where has he sprung from?" he
30028. asked, turning to Shinshin. "Didn't he vanish somewhere?"
30029. 
30030. "He did," replied Shinshin. "He was in the Caucasus and ran away from
30031. there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in
30032. Persia, where he killed the Shah's brother. Now all the Moscow ladies
30033. are mad about him! It's 'Dolokhov the Persian' that does it! We never
30034. hear a word but Dolokhov is mentioned. They swear by him, they offer
30035. him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet. Dolokhov and Anatole
30036. Kuragin have turned all our ladies' heads."
30037. 
30038. A tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed
30039. plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string of
30040. large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress
30041. and took a long time settling into her place.
30042. 
30043. Natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and pearls
30044. and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls.
30045. While Natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady
30046. looked round and, meeting the count's eyes, nodded to him and smiled.
30047. She was the Countess Bezukhova, Pierre's wife, and the count, who knew
30048. everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.
30049. 
30050. "Have you been here long, Countess?" he inquired. "I'll call, I'll call
30051. to kiss your hand. I'm here on business and have brought my girls with
30052. me. They say Semenova acts marvelously. Count Pierre never used to
30053. forget us. Is he here?"
30054. 
30055. "Yes, he meant to look in," answered Helene, and glanced attentively at
30056. Natasha.
30057. 
30058. Count Rostov resumed his seat.
30059. 
30060. "Handsome, isn't she?" he whispered to Natasha.
30061. 
30062. "Wonderful!" answered Natasha. "She's a woman one could easily fall in
30063. love with."
30064. 
30065. Just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor
30066. tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls,
30067. and the curtain rose.
30068. 
30069. As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent, and
30070. all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and all the
30071. women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole attention with
30072. eager curiosity to the stage. Natasha too began to look at it.
30073. 
30074. 
30075. 
30076. 
30077. 
30078. CHAPTER IX
30079. 
30080. 
30081. The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides was
30082. some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a cloth
30083. stretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls in red
30084. bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat
30085. apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of green cardboard
30086. was glued. They all sang something. When they had finished their song
30087. the girl in white went up to the prompter's box and a man with tight
30088. silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger,
30089. went up to her and began singing, waving his arms about.
30090. 
30091. First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they
30092. both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand
30093. of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with
30094. her. They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping
30095. and shouting, while the man and woman on the stage--who represented
30096. lovers--began smiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing.
30097. 
30098. After her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this
30099. seemed grotesque and amazing to Natasha. She could not follow the opera
30100. nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the
30101. queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in
30102. that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but
30103. it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed
30104. for the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the
30105. audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she
30106. herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening
30107. on the stage, and expressed delight which to Natasha seemed feigned. "I
30108. suppose it has to be like this!" she thought. She kept looking round in
30109. turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the
30110. seminude women in the boxes, especially at Helene in the next box,
30111. who--apparently quite unclothed--sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not
30112. taking her eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded
30113. the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natasha little
30114. by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not
30115. experienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she
30116. was, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought, the
30117. strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her
30118. mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and
30119. singing the air the actress was singing, then she wished to touch with
30120. her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to lean over to
30121. Helene and tickle her.
30122. 
30123. At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song, a door
30124. leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostovs' box creaked, and
30125. the steps of a belated arrival were heard. "There's Kuragin!" whispered
30126. Shinshin. Countess Bezukhova turned smiling to the newcomer, and
30127. Natasha, following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally
30128. handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet
30129. courteous bearing. This was Anatole Kuragin whom she had seen and
30130. noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was now in an adjutant's
30131. uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot. He moved with a restrained
30132. swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so good-looking
30133. and had his handsome face not worn such an expression of good-humored
30134. complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was proceeding, he walked
30135. deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword and spurs slightly
30136. jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high. Having looked at
30137. Natasha he approached his sister, laid his well gloved hand on the edge
30138. of her box, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a question, with a
30139. motion toward Natasha.
30140. 
30141. "Mais charmante!" said he, evidently referring to Natasha, who did not
30142. exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his
30143. lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down
30144. beside Dolokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way
30145. that Dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily,
30146. smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra screen.
30147. 
30148. "How like the brother is to the sister," remarked the count. "And how
30149. handsome they both are!"
30150. 
30151. Shinshin, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some intrigue
30152. of Kuragin's in Moscow, and Natasha tried to overhear it just because he
30153. had said she was "charmante."
30154. 
30155. The first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about, going
30156. out and coming in.
30157. 
30158. Boris came to the Rostovs' box, received their congratulations very
30159. simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed
30160. to Natasha and Sonya his fiancee's invitation to her wedding, and
30161. went away. Natasha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and
30162. congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Boris with whom she
30163. had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,
30164. everything seemed simple and natural.
30165. 
30166. The scantily clad Helene smiled at everyone in the same way, and Natasha
30167. gave Boris a similar smile.
30168. 
30169. Helene's box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most
30170. distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another
30171. in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.
30172. 
30173. During the whole of that entr'acte Kuragin stood with Dolokhov in front
30174. of the orchestra partition, looking at the Rostovs' box. Natasha knew he
30175. was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure. She even turned so
30176. that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming
30177. aspect. Before the beginning of the second act Pierre appeared in the
30178. stalls. The Rostovs had not seen him since their arrival. His face
30179. looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since Natasha last saw him.
30180. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing anyone. Anatole went up to
30181. him and began speaking to him, looking at and indicating the Rostovs'
30182. box. On seeing Natasha Pierre grew animated and, hastily passing between
30183. the rows, came toward their box. When he got there he leaned on his
30184. elbows and, smiling, talked to her for a long time. While conversing
30185. with Pierre, Natasha heard a man's voice in Countess Bezukhova's box and
30186. something told her it was Kuragin. She turned and their eyes met.
30187. Almost smiling, he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured
30188. caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him, to look at him
30189. like that, to be so sure he admired her, and not to be acquainted with
30190. him.
30191. 
30192. In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a
30193. round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over
30194. the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many
30195. people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding
30196. things like daggers in their hands. They began waving their arms. Then
30197. some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been
30198. in white and was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once,
30199. but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and
30200. behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and
30201. everyone knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly
30202. interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience.
30203. 
30204. During this act every time Natasha looked toward the stalls she saw
30205. Anatole Kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair, staring
30206. at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did
30207. not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.
30208. 
30209. When the second act was over Countess Bezukhova rose, turned to the
30210. Rostovs' box--her whole bosom completely exposed--beckoned the old count
30211. with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had entered
30212. her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.
30213. 
30214. "Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters," said she. "The
30215. whole town is singing their praises and I don't even know then!"
30216. 
30217. Natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so pleased
30218. by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure.
30219. 
30220. "I want to become a Moscovite too, now," said Helene. "How is it you're
30221. not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?"
30222. 
30223. Countess Bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating
30224. woman. She could say what she did not think--especially what was
30225. flattering--quite simply and naturally.
30226. 
30227. "Dear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I am not
30228. staying here long this time--nor are you--I will try to amuse them. I
30229. have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get to know
30230. you," said she to Natasha with her stereotyped and lovely smile. "I had
30231. heard about you from my page, Drubetskoy. Have you heard he is getting
30232. married? And also from my husband's friend Bolkonski, Prince Andrew
30233. Bolkonski," she went on with special emphasis, implying that she knew of
30234. his relation to Natasha. To get better acquainted she asked that one
30235. of the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the
30236. performance, and Natasha moved over to it.
30237. 
30238. The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles
30239. were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the
30240. walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen. The
30241. king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang something badly
30242. and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had been first in white
30243. and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the
30244. throne with her hair down. She sang something mournfully, addressing the
30245. queen, but the king waved his arm severely, and men and women with bare
30246. legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together. Then the
30247. violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick
30248. bare legs and thin arms, separating from the others, went behind the
30249. wings, adjusted her bodice, returned to the middle of the stage, and
30250. began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other. In the
30251. stalls everyone clapped and shouted "bravo!" Then one of the men went
30252. into a corner of the stage. The cymbals and horns in the orchestra
30253. struck up more loudly, and this man with bare legs jumped very high and
30254. waved his feet about very rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty
30255. thousand rubles a year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes,
30256. and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might, and the
30257. man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other men
30258. and women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted to the
30259. sound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a storm
30260. came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the
30261. orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number away,
30262. and the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise and
30263. clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began
30264. shouting: "Duport! Duport! Duport!" Natasha no longer thought this
30265. strange. She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.
30266. 
30267. "Isn't Duport delightful?" Helene asked her.
30268. 
30269. "Oh, yes," replied Natasha.
30270. 
30271. 
30272. 
30273. 
30274. 
30275. CHAPTER X
30276. 
30277. 
30278. During the entr'acte a whiff of cold air came into Helene's box, the
30279. door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush
30280. against anyone.
30281. 
30282. "Let me introduce my brother to you," said Helene, her eyes shifting
30283. uneasily from Natasha to Anatole.
30284. 
30285. Natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer
30286. and smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was as handsome
30287. at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her and told her he
30288. had long wished to have this happiness--ever since the Naryshkins' ball
30289. in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing her.
30290. Kuragin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men.
30291. He talked boldly and naturally, and Natasha was strangely and agreeably
30292. struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about
30293. whom there was so much talk, but that on the contrary his smile was most
30294. naive, cheerful, and good-natured.
30295. 
30296. Kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
30297. previous performance Semenova had fallen down on the stage.
30298. 
30299. "And do you know, Countess," he said, suddenly addressing her as an
30300. old, familiar acquaintance, "we are getting up a costume tournament; you
30301. ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We shall all meet at the
30302. Karagins'! Please come! No! Really, eh?" said he.
30303. 
30304. While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face, her
30305. neck, and her bare arms. Natasha knew for certain that he was enraptured
30306. by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel constrained and
30307. oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking
30308. at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should
30309. look into hers rather than this. But looking into his eyes she was
30310. frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had
30311. always felt between herself and other men. She did not know how it was
30312. that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to
30313. this man. When she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind
30314. by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck. They spoke of most ordinary
30315. things, yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had
30316. ever been to any man. Natasha kept turning to Helene and to her father,
30317. as if asking what it all meant, but Helene was engaged in conversation
30318. with a general and did not answer her look, and her father's eyes said
30319. nothing but what they always said: "Having a good time? Well, I'm glad
30320. of it!"
30321. 
30322. During one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole's prominent
30323. eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natasha, to break the
30324. silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the question and
30325. blushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing
30326. something improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.
30327. 
30328. "At first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant
30329. ce sont les jolies femmes, * isn't that so? But now I like it very much
30330. indeed," he said, looking at her significantly. "You'll come to the
30331. costume tournament, Countess? Do come!" and putting out his hand to her
30332. bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, "You will be the prettiest
30333. there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as a pledge!"
30334. 
30335. 
30336.     * Are the pretty women.
30337. 
30338. 
30339. Natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
30340. himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper
30341. intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had
30342. not heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she felt that
30343. he was there, behind, so close behind her.
30344. 
30345. "How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?" she asked
30346. herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked
30347. straight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the
30348. good-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just
30349. as he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt with
30350. horror that no barrier lay between him and her.
30351. 
30352. The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay. Natasha
30353. went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive to the
30354. world she found herself in. All that was going on before her now seemed
30355. quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her
30356. betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country did not once
30357. recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past.
30358. 
30359. In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm
30360. about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared
30361. down below. That was the only part of the fourth act that Natasha saw.
30362. She felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of this was Kuragin whom
30363. she could not help watching. As they were leaving the theater Anatole
30364. came up to them, called their carriage, and helped them in. As he was
30365. putting Natasha in he pressed her arm above the elbow. Agitated and
30366. flushed she turned round. He was looking at her with glittering eyes,
30367. smiling tenderly.
30368. 
30369. 
30370. Only after she had reached home was Natasha able clearly to think over
30371. what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she
30372. was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she
30373. gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.
30374. 
30375. "O God! I am lost!" she said to herself. "How could I let him?" She sat
30376. for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize
30377. what had happened to her, but was unable either to understand what
30378. had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure,
30379. and terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater where the
30380. bare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the
30381. music on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the nearly naked
30382. Helene with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried "bravo!"--there in
30383. the presence of that Helene it had all seemed clear and simple; but now,
30384. alone by herself, it was incomprehensible. "What is it? What was that
30385. terror I felt of him? What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling
30386. now?" she thought.
30387. 
30388. Only to the old countess at night in bed could Natasha have told all she
30389. was feeling. She knew that Sonya with her severe and simple views
30390. would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a
30391. confession. So Natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself.
30392. 
30393. "Am I spoiled for Andrew's love or not?" she asked herself, and with
30394. soothing irony replied: "What a fool I am to ask that! What did happen
30395. to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn't lead him on at all. Nobody
30396. will know and I shall never see him again," she told herself. "So it is
30397. plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of, and
30398. Andrew can love me still. But why 'still?' O God, why isn't he here?"
30399. Natasha quieted herself for a moment, but again some instinct told her
30400. that though all this was true, and though nothing had happened, yet the
30401. former purity of her love for Prince Andrew had perished. And again in
30402. imagination she went over her whole conversation with Kuragin, and again
30403. saw the face, gestures, and tender smile of that bold handsome man when
30404. he pressed her arm.
30405. 
30406. 
30407. 
30408. 
30409. 
30410. CHAPTER XI
30411. 
30412. 
30413. Anatole Kuragin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him
30414. away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles
30415. a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his
30416. creditors demanded from his father.
30417. 
30418. His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the
30419. last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant
30420. to the commander in chief--a post his father had procured for him--and
30421. would at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to him
30422. Princess Mary and Julie Karagina.
30423. 
30424. Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre's house.
30425. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him after a
30426. while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave him
30427. money under the guise of loans.
30428. 
30429. As Shinshin had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had
30430. turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that
30431. he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French
30432. actresses--with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to
30433. be on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at Danilov's
30434. or other Moscow revelers', drank whole nights through, outvying everyone
30435. else, and was at all the balls and parties of the best society. There
30436. was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted with a
30437. few of them at the balls. But he did not run after the unmarried girls,
30438. especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain. There was a
30439. special reason for this, as he had got married two years before--a fact
30440. known only to his most intimate friends. At that time while with his
30441. regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had forced him to
30442. marry his daughter. Anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and, for a
30443. payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law, had arranged to be
30444. free to pass himself off as a bachelor.
30445. 
30446. Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with
30447. others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
30448. impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had
30449. never in his life done anything base. He was incapable of considering
30450. how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or
30451. that action of his might be. He was convinced that, as a duck is so made
30452. that it must live in water, so God had made him such that he must spend
30453. thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in
30454. society. He believed this so firmly that others, looking at him, were
30455. persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place
30456. in society or money, which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and
30457. evidently would not repay.
30458. 
30459. He was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. He was
30460. not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still less could
30461. he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed his father by
30462. spoiling his own career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds. He
30463. was not mean, and did not refuse anyone who asked of him. All he cared
30464. about was gaiety and women, and as according to his ideas there
30465. was nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and he was incapable of
30466. considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others,
30467. he honestly considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues
30468. and bad people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high.
30469. 
30470. Rakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence
30471. similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of
30472. forgiveness. "All will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all will
30473. be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much."
30474. 
30475. Dolokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and
30476. his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and
30477. dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kuragin and made
30478. use of him for his own ends.
30479. 
30480. Anatole was sincerely fond of Dolokhov for his cleverness and audacity.
30481. Dolokhov, who needed Anatole Kuragin's name, position, and connections
30482. as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made use of him
30483. and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it.
30484. Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole, the very process
30485. of dominating another's will was in itself a pleasure, a habit, and a
30486. necessity to Dolokhov.
30487. 
30488. Natasha had made a strong impression on Kuragin. At supper after
30489. the opera he described to Dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the
30490. attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his
30491. intention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and was incapable
30492. of considering what might come of such love-making, as he never had any
30493. notion of the outcome of any of his actions.
30494. 
30495. "She's first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us," replied Dolokhov.
30496. 
30497. "I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner," said Anatole. "Eh?"
30498. 
30499. "You'd better wait till she's married...."
30500. 
30501. "You know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once," pursued
30502. Anatole.
30503. 
30504. "You have been caught once already by a 'little girl,'" said Dolokhov
30505. who knew of Kuragin's marriage. "Take care!"
30506. 
30507. "Well, that can't happen twice! Eh?" said Anatole, with a good-humored
30508. laugh.
30509. 
30510. 
30511. 
30512. 
30513. 
30514. CHAPTER XII
30515. 
30516. 
30517. The day after the opera the Rostovs went nowhere and nobody came to see
30518. them. Marya Dmitrievna talked to the count about something which they
30519. concealed from Natasha. Natasha guessed they were talking about the old
30520. prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her.
30521. She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a
30522. manservant to the Vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had
30523. not arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow.
30524. To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant
30525. recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince,
30526. and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She
30527. continually fancied that either he would never come or that something
30528. would happen to her before he came. She could no longer think of him by
30529. herself calmly and continuously as she had done before. As soon as she
30530. began to think of him, the recollection of the old prince, of Princess
30531. Mary, of the theater, and of Kuragin mingled with her thoughts. The
30532. question again presented itself whether she was not guilty, whether she
30533. had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found
30534. herself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and
30535. every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had
30536. been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying
30537. feeling. To the family Natasha seemed livelier than usual, but she was
30538. far less tranquil and happy than before.
30539. 
30540. On Sunday morning Marya Dmitrievna invited her visitors to Mass at her
30541. parish church--the Church of the Assumption built over the graves of
30542. victims of the plague.
30543. 
30544. "I don't like those fashionable churches," she said, evidently priding
30545. herself on her independence of thought. "God is the same every where.
30546. We have an excellent priest, he conducts the service decently and with
30547. dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is there in giving
30548. concerts in the choir? I don't like it, it's just self-indulgence!"
30549. 
30550. Marya Dmitrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her whole
30551. house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the
30552. servants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church. At
30553. her table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had vodka
30554. and roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was the
30555. holiday so noticeable as in Marya Dmitrievna's broad, stern face, which
30556. on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.
30557. 
30558. After Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room
30559. where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a servant
30560. announced that the carriage was ready, and Marya Dmitrievna rose with
30561. a stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and
30562. announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas Bolkonski to have an
30563. explanation with him about Natasha.
30564. 
30565. After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited
30566. on the Rostovs, and Natasha, very glad of this diversion, having shut
30567. herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying
30568. on the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and
30569. only tacked together, and was turning her head to see in the glass how
30570. the back fitted, she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of
30571. her father's voice and another's--a woman's--that made her flush. It
30572. was Helene. Natasha had not time to take off the bodice before the door
30573. opened and Countess Bezukhova, dressed in a purple velvet gown with
30574. a high collar, came into the room beaming with good-humored amiable
30575. smiles.
30576. 
30577. "Oh, my enchantress!" she cried to the blushing Natasha. "Charming! No,
30578. this is really beyond anything, my dear count," said she to Count Rostov
30579. who had followed her in. "How can you live in Moscow and go nowhere? No,
30580. I won't let you off! Mademoiselle George will recite at my house
30581. tonight and there'll be some people, and if you don't bring your lovely
30582. girls--who are prettier than Mademoiselle George--I won't know you! My
30583. husband is away in Tver or I would send him to fetch you. You must come.
30584. You positively must! Between eight and nine."
30585. 
30586. She nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied
30587. respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the
30588. looking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely. She
30589. did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually praising
30590. Natasha's beauty. She looked at Natasha's dresses and praised them, as
30591. well as a new dress of her own made of "metallic gauze," which she had
30592. received from Paris, and advised Natasha to have one like it.
30593. 
30594. "But anything suits you, my charmer!" she remarked.
30595. 
30596. A smile of pleasure never left Natasha's face. She felt happy and as if
30597. she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess Bezukhova who
30598. had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now
30599. so kind to her. Natasha brightened up and felt almost in love with
30600. this woman, who was so beautiful and so kind. Helene for her part was
30601. sincerely delighted with Natasha and wished to give her a good time.
30602. Anatole had asked her to bring him and Natasha together, and she was
30603. calling on the Rostovs for that purpose. The idea of throwing her
30604. brother and Natasha together amused her.
30605. 
30606. Though at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with Natasha for
30607. drawing Boris away, she did not think of that now, and in her own way
30608. heartily wished Natasha well. As she was leaving the Rostovs she called
30609. her protegee aside.
30610. 
30611. "My brother dined with me yesterday--we nearly died of laughter--he ate
30612. nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite madly,
30613. in love with you, my dear."
30614. 
30615. Natasha blushed scarlet when she heard this.
30616. 
30617. "How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!" said Helene. "You must
30618. certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a reason
30619. to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your fiance
30620. would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death."
30621. 
30622. "So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre--that good
30623. Pierre--have talked and laughed about this. So it's all right." And
30624. again, under Helene's influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed
30625. simple and natural. "And she is such a grande dame, so kind, and
30626. evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?" thought Natasha,
30627. gazing at Helene with wide-open, wondering eyes.
30628. 
30629. Marya Dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having
30630. evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince's. She was still too
30631. agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly. In
30632. answer to the count's inquiries she replied that things were all right
30633. and that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of Countess
30634. Bezukhova's visit and the invitation for that evening, Marya Dmitrievna
30635. remarked:
30636. 
30637. "I don't care to have anything to do with Bezukhova and don't advise you
30638. to; however, if you've promised--go. It will divert your thoughts," she
30639. added, addressing Natasha.
30640. 
30641. 
30642. 
30643. 
30644. 
30645. CHAPTER XIII
30646. 
30647. 
30648. Count Rostov took the girls to Countess Bezukhova's. There were a good
30649. many people there, but nearly all strangers to Natasha. Count Rostov was
30650. displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and
30651. women known for the freedom of their conduct. Mademoiselle George was
30652. standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men. There
30653. were several Frenchmen present, among them Metivier who from the time
30654. Helene reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house. The count
30655. decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and
30656. to get away as soon as Mademoiselle George's performance was over.
30657. 
30658. Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the Rostovs.
30659. Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natasha and followed
30660. her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had
30661. had at the opera--gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at
30662. the absence of a moral barrier between them.
30663. 
30664. Helene welcomed Natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her
30665. beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went
30666. out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people began
30667. arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a chair for
30668. Natasha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count, who never
30669. lost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down behind her.
30670. 
30671. Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red shawl
30672. draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for her, and
30673. assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was audible.
30674. 
30675. Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and
30676. began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her
30677. son. In some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered,
30678. lifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse
30679. sounds, rolling her eyes.
30680. 
30681. "Adorable! divine! delicious!" was heard from every side.
30682. 
30683. Natasha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor
30684. understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself
30685. again completely borne away into this strange senseless world--so remote
30686. from her old world--a world in which it was impossible to know what
30687. was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole,
30688. and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of
30689. expectancy.
30690. 
30691. After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
30692. Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.
30693. 
30694. "How beautiful she is!" Natasha remarked to her father who had also
30695. risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.
30696. 
30697. "I don't think so when I look at you!" said Anatole, following Natasha.
30698. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him. "You are
30699. enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never ceased..."
30700. 
30701. "Come, come, Natasha!" said the count, as he turned back for his
30702. daughter. "How beautiful she is!" Natasha without saying anything
30703. stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring
30704. eyes.
30705. 
30706. After giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and Countess
30707. Bezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.
30708. 
30709. The count wished to go home, but Helene entreated him not to spoil her
30710. improvised ball, and the Rostovs stayed on. Anatole asked Natasha for a
30711. valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she
30712. was bewitching and that he loved her. During the ecossaise, which she
30713. also danced with him, Anatole said nothing when they happened to be by
30714. themselves, but merely gazed at her. Natasha lifted her frightened eyes
30715. to him, but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look
30716. and smile that she could not, whilst looking at him, say what she had to
30717. say. She lowered her eyes.
30718. 
30719. "Don't say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another," she said
30720. rapidly.... She glanced at him.
30721. 
30722. Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.
30723. 
30724. "Don't speak to me of that! What can I do?" said he. "I tell you I
30725. am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are
30726. enchanting?... It's our turn to begin."
30727. 
30728. Natasha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open
30729. frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly
30730. anything that went on that evening. They danced the ecossaise and the
30731. Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to remain.
30732. Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt his eyes
30733. upon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her
30734. go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that Helene had followed
30735. her and spoken laughingly of her brother's love, and that she again met
30736. Anatole in the little sitting room. Helene had disappeared leaving them
30737. alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice:
30738. 
30739. "I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see
30740. you? I love you madly. Can I never...?" and, blocking her path, he
30741. brought his face close to hers.
30742. 
30743. His large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw
30744. nothing but them.
30745. 
30746. "Natalie?" he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
30747. painfully pressed. "Natalie?"
30748. 
30749. "I don't understand. I have nothing to say," her eyes replied.
30750. 
30751. Burning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she felt
30752. herself released, and Helene's footsteps and the rustle of her dress
30753. were heard in the room. Natasha looked round at her, and then, red
30754. and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved
30755. toward the door.
30756. 
30757. "One word, just one, for God's sake!" cried Anatole.
30758. 
30759. She paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what
30760. had happened and to which she could find no answer.
30761. 
30762. "Natalie, just a word, only one!" he kept repeating, evidently not
30763. knowing what to say and he repeated it till Helene came up to them.
30764. 
30765. Helene returned with Natasha to the drawing room. The Rostovs went away
30766. without staying for supper.
30767. 
30768. After reaching home Natasha did not sleep all night. She was tormented
30769. by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew.
30770. She loved Prince Andrew--she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved
30771. him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. "Else how
30772. could all this have happened?" thought she. "If, after that, I could
30773. return his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to
30774. that, it means that I loved him from the first. It means that he is
30775. kind, noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I
30776. to do if I love him and the other one too?" she asked herself, unable to
30777. find an answer to these terrible questions.
30778. 
30779. 
30780. 
30781. 
30782. 
30783. CHAPTER XIV
30784. 
30785. 
30786. Morning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began to
30787. move about and talk, dressmakers came again. Marya Dmitrievna appeared,
30788. and they were called to breakfast. Natasha kept looking uneasily at
30789. everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept every glance
30790. directed toward her, and tried to appear the same as usual.
30791. 
30792. After breakfast, which was her best time, Marya Dmitrievna sat down in
30793. her armchair and called Natasha and the count to her.
30794. 
30795. "Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is
30796. my advice," she began. "Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince
30797. Bolkonski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to
30798. begin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had
30799. to say!"
30800. 
30801. "Well, and he?" asked the count.
30802. 
30803. "He? He's crazy... he did not want to listen. But what's the use
30804. of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out," said Marya
30805. Dmitrievna. "My advice to you is finish your business and go back home
30806. to Otradnoe... and wait there."
30807. 
30808. "Oh, no!" exclaimed Natasha.
30809. 
30810. "Yes, go back," said Marya Dmitrievna, "and wait there. If your
30811. betrothed comes here now--there will be no avoiding a quarrel; but alone
30812. with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you."
30813. 
30814. Count Rostov approved of this suggestion, appreciating its
30815. reasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better to
30816. visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding,
30817. against his wishes, could only be arranged at Otradnoe.
30818. 
30819. "That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took her,"
30820. said the old count.
30821. 
30822. "No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But if he
30823. won't--that's his affair," said Marya Dmitrievna, looking for something
30824. in her reticule. "Besides, the trousseau is ready, so there is nothing
30825. to wait for; and what is not ready I'll send after you. Though I don't
30826. like letting you go, it is the best way. So go, with God's blessing!"
30827. 
30828. Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to
30829. Natasha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.
30830. 
30831. "She has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! She's
30832. afraid you might think that she does not like you."
30833. 
30834. "But she doesn't like me," said Natasha.
30835. 
30836. "Don't talk nonsense!" cried Marya Dmitrievna.
30837. 
30838. "I shan't believe anyone, I know she doesn't like me," replied Natasha
30839. boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold and angry
30840. resolution that caused Marya Dmitrievna to look at her more intently and
30841. to frown.
30842. 
30843. "Don't answer like that, my good girl!" she said. "What I say is true!
30844. Write an answer!" Natasha did not reply and went to her own room to read
30845. Princess Mary's letter.
30846. 
30847. Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that
30848. had occurred between them. Whatever her father's feelings might be, she
30849. begged Natasha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one
30850. chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice
30851. everything.
30852. 
30853. "Do not think, however," she wrote, "that my father is ill-disposed
30854. toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven; but
30855. he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy."
30856. Princess Mary went on to ask Natasha to fix a time when she could see
30857. her again.
30858. 
30859. After reading the letter Natasha sat down at the writing table to answer
30860. it. "Dear Princess," she wrote in French quickly and mechanically, and
30861. then paused. What more could she write after all that had happened
30862. the evening before? "Yes, yes! All that has happened, and now all is
30863. changed," she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before
30864. her. "Must I break off with him? Must I really? That's awful..." and to
30865. escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to Sonya and began sorting
30866. patterns with her.
30867. 
30868. After dinner Natasha went to her room and again took up Princess Mary's
30869. letter. "Can it be that it is all over?" she thought. "Can it be
30870. that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went
30871. before?" She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former
30872. strength, and at the same time felt that she loved Kuragin. She vividly
30873. pictured herself as Prince Andrew's wife, and the scenes of happiness
30874. with him she had so often repeated in her imagination, and at the
30875. same time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of yesterday's
30876. interview with Anatole.
30877. 
30878. "Why could that not be as well?" she sometimes asked herself in complete
30879. bewilderment. "Only so could I be completely happy; but now I have to
30880. choose, and I can't be happy without either of them. Only," she thought,
30881. "to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are
30882. both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is spoiled. But am
30883. I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew's love, in which I
30884. have lived so long?"
30885. 
30886. "Please, Miss!" whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious
30887. air. "A man told me to give you this-" and she handed Natasha a letter.
30888. 
30889. "Only, for Christ's sake..." the girl went on, as Natasha, without
30890. thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from
30891. Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only that
30892. it was a letter from him--from the man she loved. Yes, she loved him, or
30893. else how could that have happened which had happened? And how could she
30894. have a love letter from him in her hand?
30895. 
30896. With trembling hands Natasha held that passionate love letter which
30897. Dolokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she found in it an
30898. echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.
30899. 
30900. "Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you or
30901. to die. There is no other way for me," the letter began. Then he went
30902. on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him--for this
30903. there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her--but that if
30904. she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power could
30905. hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her away and
30906. carry her off to the ends of the earth.
30907. 
30908. "Yes, yes! I love him!" thought Natasha, reading the letter for the
30909. twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of
30910. it.
30911. 
30912. That evening Marya Dmitrievna was going to the Akharovs' and proposed to
30913. take the girls with her. Natasha, pleading a headache, remained at home.
30914. 
30915. 
30916. 
30917. 
30918. 
30919. CHAPTER XV
30920. 
30921. 
30922. On returning late in the evening Sonya went to Natasha's room, and to
30923. her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open on the
30924. table, beside her lay Anatole's letter. Sonya picked it up and read it.
30925. 
30926. As she read she glanced at the sleeping Natasha, trying to find in her
30927. face an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find it. Her
30928. face was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep herself
30929. from choking, Sonya, pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat
30930. down in an armchair and burst into tears.
30931. 
30932. "How was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she have
30933. left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let Kuragin go to
30934. such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that's plain! What will
30935. Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is
30936. the meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before
30937. yesterday, yesterday, and today," thought Sonya. "But it can't be that
30938. she loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who it was
30939. from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not do such a thing!"
30940. 
30941. Sonya wiped away her tears and went up to Natasha, again scanning her
30942. face.
30943. 
30944. "Natasha!" she said, just audibly.
30945. 
30946. Natasha awoke and saw Sonya.
30947. 
30948. "Ah, you're back?"
30949. 
30950. And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment
30951. of awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing Sonya's look of
30952. embarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.
30953. 
30954. "Sonya, you've read that letter?" she demanded.
30955. 
30956. "Yes," answered Sonya softly.
30957. 
30958. Natasha smiled rapturously.
30959. 
30960. "No, Sonya, I can't any longer!" she said. "I can't hide it from you
30961. any longer. You know, we love one another! Sonya, darling, he writes...
30962. Sonya..."
30963. 
30964. Sonya stared open-eyed at Natasha, unable to believe her ears.
30965. 
30966. "And Bolkonski?" she asked.
30967. 
30968. "Ah, Sonya, if you only knew how happy I am!" cried Natasha. "You don't
30969. know what love is...."
30970. 
30971. "But, Natasha, can that be all over?"
30972. 
30973. Natasha looked at Sonya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp
30974. the question.
30975. 
30976. "Well, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?" said Sonya.
30977. 
30978. "Oh, you don't understand anything! Don't talk nonsense, just listen!"
30979. said Natasha, with momentary vexation.
30980. 
30981. "But I can't believe it," insisted Sonya. "I don't understand. How is it
30982. you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly... Why, you have only
30983. seen him three times! Natasha, I don't believe you, you're joking! In
30984. three days to forget everything and so..."
30985. 
30986. "Three days?" said Natasha. "It seems to me I've loved him a hundred
30987. years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You can't
30988. understand it.... Sonya, wait a bit, sit here," and Natasha embraced and
30989. kissed her.
30990. 
30991. "I had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it too,
30992. but it's only now that I feel such love. It's not the same as before.
30993. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave, and that
30994. I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders I shall
30995. do. You don't understand that. What can I do? What can I do, Sonya?"
30996. cried Natasha with a happy yet frightened expression.
30997. 
30998. "But think what you are doing," cried Sonya. "I can't leave it like
30999. this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so far?"
31000. she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.
31001. 
31002. "I told you that I have no will," Natasha replied. "Why can't you
31003. understand? I love him!"
31004. 
31005. "Then I won't let it come to that... I shall tell!" cried Sonya,
31006. bursting into tears.
31007. 
31008. "What do you mean? For God's sake... If you tell, you are my enemy!"
31009. declared Natasha. "You want me to be miserable, you want us to be
31010. separated...."
31011. 
31012. When she saw Natasha's fright, Sonya shed tears of shame and pity for
31013. her friend.
31014. 
31015. "But what has happened between you?" she asked. "What has he said to
31016. you? Why doesn't he come to the house?"
31017. 
31018. Natasha did not answer her questions.
31019. 
31020. "For God's sake, Sonya, don't tell anyone, don't torture me," Natasha
31021. entreated. "Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters! I have
31022. confided in you...."
31023. 
31024. "But why this secrecy? Why doesn't he come to the house?" asked Sonya.
31025. "Why doesn't he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince Andrew gave
31026. you complete freedom--if it is really so; but I don't believe it!
31027. Natasha, have you considered what these secret reasons can be?"
31028. 
31029. Natasha looked at Sonya with astonishment. Evidently this question
31030. presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how
31031. to answer it.
31032. 
31033. "I don't know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!"
31034. 
31035. Sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously.
31036. 
31037. "If there were reasons..." she began.
31038. 
31039. But Natasha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.
31040. 
31041. "Sonya, one can't doubt him! One can't, one can't! Don't you
31042. understand?" she cried.
31043. 
31044. "Does he love you?"
31045. 
31046. "Does he love me?" Natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her friend's
31047. lack of comprehension. "Why, you have read his letter and you have seen
31048. him."
31049. 
31050. "But if he is dishonorable?"
31051. 
31052. "He! dishonorable? If you only knew!" exclaimed Natasha.
31053. 
31054. "If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or
31055. cease seeing you; and if you won't do this, I will. I will write to him,
31056. and I will tell Papa!" said Sonya resolutely.
31057. 
31058. "But I can't live without him!" cried Natasha.
31059. 
31060. "Natasha, I don't understand you. And what are you saying! Think of your
31061. father and of Nicholas."
31062. 
31063. "I don't want anyone, I don't love anyone but him. How dare you say he
31064. is dishonorable? Don't you know that I love him?" screamed Natasha. "Go
31065. away, Sonya! I don't want to quarrel with you, but go, for God's sake
31066. go! You see how I am suffering!" Natasha cried angrily, in a voice of
31067. despair and repressed irritation. Sonya burst into sobs and ran from the
31068. room.
31069. 
31070. Natasha went to the table and without a moment's reflection wrote that
31071. answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all
31072. the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their
31073. misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the
31074. magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her
31075. freedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her
31076. if she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his wife.
31077. At that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to Natasha.
31078. 
31079. 
31080. On Friday the Rostovs were to return to the country, but on Wednesday
31081. the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow.
31082. 
31083. On the day the count left, Sonya and Natasha were invited to a big
31084. dinner party at the Karagins', and Marya Dmitrievna took them there. At
31085. that party Natasha again met Anatole, and Sonya noticed that she spoke
31086. to him, trying not to be overheard, and that all through dinner she was
31087. more agitated than ever. When they got home Natasha was the first to
31088. begin the explanation Sonya expected.
31089. 
31090. "There, Sonya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,"
31091. Natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be
31092. praised. "We have had an explanation today."
31093. 
31094. "Well, what happened? What did he say? Natasha, how glad I am you're not
31095. angry with me! Tell me everything--the whole truth. What did he say?"
31096. 
31097. Natasha became thoughtful.
31098. 
31099. "Oh, Sonya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I had
31100. promised Bolkonski. He was glad I was free to refuse him."
31101. 
31102. Sonya sighed sorrowfully.
31103. 
31104. "But you haven't refused Bolkonski?" said she.
31105. 
31106. "Perhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonski. Why do
31107. you think so badly of me?"
31108. 
31109. "I don't think anything, only I don't understand this..."
31110. 
31111. "Wait a bit, Sonya, you'll understand everything. You'll see what a man
31112. he is! Now don't think badly of me or of him. I don't think badly of
31113. anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?"
31114. 
31115. Sonya did not succumb to the tender tone Natasha used toward her. The
31116. more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natasha's face became,
31117. the more serious and stern grew Sonya's.
31118. 
31119. "Natasha," said she, "you asked me not to speak to you, and I haven't
31120. spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I don't trust him, Natasha. Why
31121. this secrecy?"
31122. 
31123. "Again, again!" interrupted Natasha.
31124. 
31125. "Natasha, I am afraid for you!"
31126. 
31127. "Afraid of what?"
31128. 
31129. "I am afraid you're going to your ruin," said Sonya resolutely, and was
31130. herself horrified at what she had said.
31131. 
31132. Anger again showed in Natasha's face.
31133. 
31134. "And I'll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It's not your
31135. business! It won't be you, but I, who'll suffer. Leave me alone, leave
31136. me alone! I hate you!"
31137. 
31138. "Natasha!" moaned Sonya, aghast.
31139. 
31140. "I hate you, I hate you! You're my enemy forever!" And Natasha ran out
31141. of the room.
31142. 
31143. Natasha did not speak to Sonya again and avoided her. With the same
31144. expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house,
31145. taking up now one occupation, now another, and at once abandoning them.
31146. 
31147. Hard as it was for Sonya, she watched her friend and did not let her out
31148. of her sight.
31149. 
31150. The day before the count was to return, Sonya noticed that Natasha sat
31151. by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting something and
31152. that she made a sign to an officer who drove past, whom Sonya took to be
31153. Anatole.
31154. 
31155. Sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that
31156. at dinner and all that evening Natasha was in a strange and unnatural
31157. state. She answered questions at random, began sentences she did not
31158. finish, and laughed at everything.
31159. 
31160. After tea Sonya noticed a housemaid at Natasha's door timidly waiting
31161. to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at the door
31162. learned that another letter had been delivered.
31163. 
31164. Then suddenly it became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some dreadful
31165. plan for that evening. Sonya knocked at her door. Natasha did not let
31166. her in.
31167. 
31168. "She will run away with him!" thought Sonya. "She is capable of
31169. anything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her
31170. face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle," Sonya remembered.
31171. "Yes, that's it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?"
31172. thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that Natasha
31173. had some terrible intention. "The count is away. What am I to do? Write
31174. to Kuragin demanding an explanation? But what is there to oblige him
31175. to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew asked me to in case of some
31176. misfortune?... But perhaps she really has already refused Bolkonski--she
31177. sent a letter to Princess Mary yesterday. And Uncle is away...." To tell
31178. Marya Dmitrievna who had such faith in Natasha seemed to Sonya terrible.
31179. "Well, anyway," thought Sonya as she stood in the dark passage, "now or
31180. never I must prove that I remember the family's goodness to me and that
31181. I love Nicholas. Yes! If I don't sleep for three nights I'll not leave
31182. this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the
31183. family be disgraced," thought she.
31184. 
31185. 
31186. 
31187. 
31188. 
31189. CHAPTER XVI
31190. 
31191. 
31192. Anatole had lately moved to Dolokhov's. The plan for Natalie Rostova's
31193. abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by Dolokhov a few
31194. days before, and on the day that Sonya, after listening at Natasha's
31195. door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been put into execution.
31196. Natasha had promised to come out to Kuragin at the back porch at ten
31197. that evening. Kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have
31198. ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of Kamenka, where an
31199. unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over
31200. them. At Kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to
31201. the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would hasten abroad with post
31202. horses.
31203. 
31204. Anatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand rubles
31205. he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with
31206. Dolokhov's help.
31207. 
31208. Two witnesses for the mock marriage--Khvostikov, a retired petty
31209. official whom Dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and
31210. Makarin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded
31211. affection for Kuragin--were sitting at tea in Dolokhov's front room.
31212. 
31213. In his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with
31214. Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat Dolokhov in a traveling cloak
31215. and high boots, at an open desk on which lay abacus and some bundles of
31216. paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and fro from
31217. the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the room
31218. behind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his
31219. things. Dolokhov was counting the money and noting something down.
31220. 
31221. "Well," he said, "Khvostikov must have two thousand."
31222. 
31223. "Give it to him, then," said Anatole.
31224. 
31225. "Makarka" (their name for Makarin) "will go through fire and water for
31226. you for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled," said Dolokhov,
31227. showing him the memorandum. "Is that right?"
31228. 
31229. "Yes, of course," returned Anatole, evidently not listening to Dolokhov
31230. and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his
31231. face.
31232. 
31233. Dolokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an
31234. ironic smile:
31235. 
31236. "Do you know? You'd really better drop it all. There's still time!"
31237. 
31238. "Fool," retorted Anatole. "Don't talk nonsense! If you only knew... it's
31239. the devil knows what!"
31240. 
31241. "No, really, give it up!" said Dolokhov. "I am speaking seriously. It's
31242. no joke, this plot you've hatched."
31243. 
31244. "What, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?" said Anatole, making a
31245. grimace. "Really it's no time for your stupid jokes," and he left the
31246. room.
31247. 
31248. Dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone
31249. out.
31250. 
31251. "You wait a bit," he called after him. "I'm not joking, I'm talking
31252. sense. Come here, come here!"
31253. 
31254. Anatole returned and looked at Dolokhov, trying to give him his
31255. attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.
31256. 
31257. "Now listen to me. I'm telling you this for the last time. Why should
31258. I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for you? Who
31259. found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I did it
31260. all."
31261. 
31262. "Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?" And Anatole
31263. sighed and embraced Dolokhov.
31264. 
31265. "I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a
31266. dangerous business, and if you think about it--a stupid business. Well,
31267. you'll carry her off--all right! Will they let it stop at that? It
31268. will come out that you're already married. Why, they'll have you in the
31269. criminal court...."
31270. 
31271. "Oh, nonsense, nonsense!" Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace.
31272. "Didn't I explain to you? What?" And Anatole, with the partiality
31273. dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their
31274. own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to Dolokhov
31275. a hundred times. "Didn't I explain to you that I have come to this
31276. conclusion: if this marriage is invalid," he went on, crooking one
31277. finger, "then I have nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no
31278. matter! Abroad no one will know anything about it. Isn't that so? And
31279. don't talk to me, don't, don't."
31280. 
31281. "Seriously, you'd better drop it! You'll only get yourself into a mess!"
31282. 
31283. "Go to the devil!" cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the room,
31284. but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of Dolokhov
31285. with his feet turned under him. "It's the very devil! What? Feel how it
31286. beats!" He took Dolokhov's hand and put it on his heart. "What a foot,
31287. my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!" he added in French. "What?"
31288. 
31289. Dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes
31290. looked at him--evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him.
31291. 
31292. "Well and when the money's gone, what then?"
31293. 
31294. "What then? Eh?" repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a thought
31295. of the future. "What then?... Then, I don't know.... But why talk
31296. nonsense!" He glanced at his watch. "It's time!"
31297. 
31298. Anatole went into the back room.
31299. 
31300. "Now then! Nearly ready? You're dawdling!" he shouted to the servants.
31301. 
31302. Dolokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to bring
31303. something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into
31304. the room where Khvostikov and Makarin were sitting.
31305. 
31306. Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling
31307. pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself.
31308. 
31309. "Come and eat something. Have a drink!" Dolokhov shouted to him from the
31310. other room.
31311. 
31312. "I don't want to," answered Anatole continuing to smile.
31313. 
31314. "Come! Balaga is here."
31315. 
31316. Anatole rose and went into the dining room. Balaga was a famous troyka
31317. driver who had known Dolokhov and Anatole some six years and had given
31318. them good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatole's
31319. regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the
31320. evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again
31321. the next night. More than once he had enabled Dolokhov to escape when
31322. pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies
31323. and "ladykins" as he called the cocottes. More than once in their
31324. service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets
31325. of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by "my
31326. gentlemen" as he called them. He had ruined more than one horse in their
31327. service. More than once they had beaten him, and more than once they
31328. had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, which he loved; and he knew
31329. more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an
31330. ordinary man to Siberia. They often called Balaga into their orgies and
31331. made him drink and dance at the gypsies', and more than one thousand
31332. rubles of their money had passed through his hands. In their service he
31333. risked his skin and his life twenty times a year, and in their service
31334. had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy. But
31335. he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour, liked
31336. upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at full
31337. gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild, tipsy
31338. shouts behind him: "Get on! Get on!" when it was impossible to go any
31339. faster. He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant
31340. who, more dead than alive, was already hurrying out of his way. "Real
31341. gentlemen!" he considered them.
31342. 
31343. Anatole and Dolokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and
31344. because he liked the things they liked. With others Balaga bargained,
31345. charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours' drive, and rarely drove
31346. himself, generally letting his young men do so. But with "his gentlemen"
31347. he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work. Only
31348. a couple of times a year--when he knew from their valets that they had
31349. money in hand--he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep
31350. bow would ask them to help him. The gentlemen always made him sit down.
31351. 
31352. "Do help me out, Theodore Ivanych, sir," or "your excellency," he would
31353. say. "I am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to go to the
31354. fair."
31355. 
31356. And Anatole and Dolokhov, when they had money, would give him a thousand
31357. or a couple of thousand rubles.
31358. 
31359. Balaga was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about
31360. twenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck, glittering
31361. little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine, dark-blue, silk-lined
31362. cloth coat over a sheepskin.
31363. 
31364. On entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the front
31365. corner of the room, and went up to Dolokhov, holding out a small, black
31366. hand.
31367. 
31368. "Theodore Ivanych!" he said, bowing.
31369. 
31370. "How d'you do, friend? Well, here he is!"
31371. 
31372. "Good day, your excellency!" he said, again holding out his hand to
31373. Anatole who had just come in.
31374. 
31375. "I say, Balaga," said Anatole, putting his hands on the man's shoulders,
31376. "do you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service.... What horses
31377. have you come with? Eh?"
31378. 
31379. "As your messenger ordered, your special beasts," replied Balaga.
31380. 
31381. "Well, listen, Balaga! Drive all three to death but get me there in
31382. three hours. Eh?"
31383. 
31384. "When they are dead, what shall I drive?" said Balaga with a wink.
31385. 
31386. "Mind, I'll smash your face in! Don't make jokes!" cried Anatole,
31387. suddenly rolling his eyes.
31388. 
31389. "Why joke?" said the driver, laughing. "As if I'd grudge my gentlemen
31390. anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast we'll go!"
31391. 
31392. "Ah!" said Anatole. "Well, sit down."
31393. 
31394. "Yes, sit down!" said Dolokhov.
31395. 
31396. "I'll stand, Theodore Ivanych."
31397. 
31398. "Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!" said Anatole, and filled a large
31399. glass of Madeira for him.
31400. 
31401. The driver's eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After refusing
31402. it for manners' sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk
31403. handkerchief he took out of his cap.
31404. 
31405. "And when are we to start, your excellency?"
31406. 
31407. "Well..." Anatole looked at his watch. "We'll start at once. Mind,
31408. Balaga! You'll get there in time? Eh?"
31409. 
31410. "That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn't we be there
31411. in time?" replied Balaga. "Didn't we get you to Tver in seven hours? I
31412. think you remember that, your excellency?"
31413. 
31414. "Do you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver," said Anatole, smilingly
31415. at the recollection and turning to Makarin who gazed rapturously at him
31416. with wide-open eyes. "Will you believe it, Makarka, it took one's breath
31417. away, the rate we flew. We came across a train of loaded sleighs and
31418. drove right over two of them. Eh?"
31419. 
31420. "Those were horses!" Balaga continued the tale. "That time I'd harnessed
31421. two young side horses with the bay in the shafts," he went on, turning
31422. to Dolokhov. "Will you believe it, Theodore Ivanych, those animals flew
31423. forty miles? I couldn't hold them in, my hands grew numb in the sharp
31424. frost so that I threw down the reins--'Catch hold yourself, your
31425. excellency!' says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and
31426. sprawled there. It wasn't a case of urging them on, there was no holding
31427. them in till we reached the place. The devils took us there in three
31428. hours! Only the near one died of it."
31429. 
31430. 
31431. 
31432. 
31433. 
31434. CHAPTER XVII
31435. 
31436. 
31437. Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing
31438. a fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily set on one
31439. side and very becoming to his handsome face. Having looked in a mirror,
31440. and standing before Dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it,
31441. he lifted a glass of wine.
31442. 
31443. "Well, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!" said
31444. Anatole. "Well, comrades and friends..." he considered for a moment
31445. "...of my youth, farewell!" he said, turning to Makarin and the others.
31446. 
31447. Though they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to make
31448. something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades. He
31449. spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed
31450. one leg.
31451. 
31452. "All take glasses; you too, Balaga. Well, comrades and friends of my
31453. youth, we've had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when
31454. shall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good time--now
31455. farewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!..." he cried, and emptying his
31456. glass flung it on the floor.
31457. 
31458. "To your health!" said Balaga who also emptied his glass, and wiped his
31459. mouth with his handkerchief.
31460. 
31461. Makarin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.
31462. 
31463. "Ah, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!
31464. 
31465. "Let's go. Let's go!" cried Anatole.
31466. 
31467. Balaga was about to leave the room.
31468. 
31469. "No, stop!" said Anatole. "Shut the door; we have first to sit down.
31470. That's the way."
31471. 
31472. They shut the door and all sat down.
31473. 
31474. "Now, quick march, lads!" said Anatole, rising.
31475. 
31476. Joseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all
31477. went out into the vestibule.
31478. 
31479. "And where's the fur cloak?" asked Dolokhov. "Hey, Ignatka! Go to
31480. Matrena Matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what
31481. elopements are like," continued Dolokhov with a wink. "Why, she'll rush
31482. out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay
31483. at all there'll be tears and 'Papa' and 'Mamma,' and she's frozen in
31484. a minute and must go back--but you wrap the fur cloak round her first
31485. thing and carry her to the sleigh."
31486. 
31487. The valet brought a woman's fox-lined cloak.
31488. 
31489. "Fool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matrena, the sable!" he shouted so
31490. that his voice rang far through the rooms.
31491. 
31492. A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes
31493. and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable
31494. mantle on her arm.
31495. 
31496. "Here, I don't grudge it--take it!" she said, evidently afraid of her
31497. master and yet regretful of her cloak.
31498. 
31499. Dolokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over Matrena, and
31500. wrapped her up in it.
31501. 
31502. "That's the way," said Dolokhov, "and then so!" and he turned the collar
31503. up round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered. "And
31504. then so, do you see?" and he pushed Anatole's head forward to meet the
31505. gap left by the collar, through which Matrena's brilliant smile was
31506. seen.
31507. 
31508. "Well, good-by, Matrena," said Anatole, kissing her. "Ah, my revels here
31509. are over. Remember me to Steshka. There, good-by! Good-by, Matrena, wish
31510. me luck!"
31511. 
31512. "Well, Prince, may God give you great luck!" said Matrena in her gypsy
31513. accent.
31514. 
31515. Two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were
31516. holding the horses. Balaga took his seat in the front one and holding
31517. his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and Dolokhov
31518. got in with him. Makarin, Khvostikov, and a valet seated themselves in
31519. the other sleigh.
31520. 
31521. "Well, are you ready?" asked Balaga.
31522. 
31523. "Go!" he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka tore
31524. down the Nikitski Boulevard.
31525. 
31526. "Tproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!..." The shouting of Balaga
31527. and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could
31528. be heard. On the Arbat Square the troyka caught against a carriage;
31529. something cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the
31530. Arbat Street.
31531. 
31532. After taking a turn along the Podnovinski Boulevard, Balaga began to
31533. rein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old Konyusheny
31534. Street.
31535. 
31536. The young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole
31537. and Dolokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the gate
31538. Dolokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.
31539. 
31540. "Come into the courtyard or you'll be seen; she'll come out directly,"
31541. said she.
31542. 
31543. Dolokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the
31544. courtyard, turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.
31545. 
31546. He was met by Gabriel, Marya Dmitrievna's gigantic footman.
31547. 
31548. "Come to the mistress, please," said the footman in his deep bass,
31549. intercepting any retreat.
31550. 
31551. "To what Mistress? Who are you?" asked Anatole in a breathless whisper.
31552. 
31553. "Kindly step in, my orders are to bring you in."
31554. 
31555. "Kuragin! Come back!" shouted Dolokhov. "Betrayed! Back!"
31556. 
31557. Dolokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and was
31558. struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it. With a last
31559. desperate effort Dolokhov pushed the porter aside, and when Anatole ran
31560. back seized him by the arm, pulled him through the wicket, and ran back
31561. with him to the troyka.
31562. 
31563. 
31564. 
31565. 
31566. 
31567. CHAPTER XVIII
31568. 
31569. 
31570. Marya Dmitrievna, having found Sonya weeping in the corridor, made her
31571. confess everything, and intercepting the note to Natasha she read it and
31572. went into Natasha's room with it in her hand.
31573. 
31574. "You shameless good-for-nothing!" said she. "I won't hear a word."
31575. 
31576. Pushing back Natasha who looked at her with astonished but tearless
31577. eyes, she locked her in; and having given orders to the yard porter to
31578. admit the persons who would be coming that evening, but not to let them
31579. out again, and having told the footman to bring them up to her, she
31580. seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors.
31581. 
31582. When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run
31583. away again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced
31584. through the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward
31585. midnight she went to Natasha's room fingering the key in her pocket.
31586. Sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. "Marya Dmitrievna, for God's
31587. sake let me in to her!" she pleaded, but Marya Dmitrievna unlocked
31588. the door and went in without giving her an answer.... "Disgusting,
31589. abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I'm only sorry for her
31590. father!" thought she, trying to restrain her wrath. "Hard as it may
31591. be, I'll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the
31592. count." She entered the room with resolute steps. Natasha lying on the
31593. sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and she did not stir. She was in
31594. just the same position in which Marya Dmitrievna had left her.
31595. 
31596. "A nice girl! Very nice!" said Marya Dmitrievna. "Arranging meetings
31597. with lovers in my house! It's no use pretending: you listen when I speak
31598. to you!" And Marya Dmitrievna touched her arm. "Listen when I speak!
31599. You've disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. I'd treat you
31600. differently, but I'm sorry for your father, so I will conceal it."
31601. 
31602. Natasha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved with
31603. noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. Marya Dmitrievna glanced
31604. round at Sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natasha.
31605. 
31606. "It's lucky for him that he escaped me; but I'll find him!" she said in
31607. her rough voice. "Do you hear what I am saying or not?" she added.
31608. 
31609. She put her large hand under Natasha's face and turned it toward her.
31610. Both Marya Dmitrievna and Sonya were amazed when they saw how Natasha
31611. looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her
31612. cheeks sunken.
31613. 
31614. "Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!" she muttered,
31615. wrenching herself from Marya Dmitrievna's hands with a vicious effort
31616. and sinking down again into her former position.
31617. 
31618. "Natalie!" said Marya Dmitrievna. "I wish for your good. Lie still,
31619. stay like that then, I won't touch you. But listen. I won't tell you how
31620. guilty you are. You know that yourself. But when your father comes back
31621. tomorrow what am I to tell him? Eh?"
31622. 
31623. Again Natasha's body shook with sobs.
31624. 
31625. "Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?"
31626. 
31627. "I have no betrothed: I have refused him!" cried Natasha.
31628. 
31629. "That's all the same," continued Marya Dmitrievna. "If they hear of
31630. this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he
31631. challenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?"
31632. 
31633. "Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked
31634. you to?" shouted Natasha, raising herself on the sofa and looking
31635. malignantly at Marya Dmitrievna.
31636. 
31637. "But what did you want?" cried Marya Dmitrievna, growing angry again.
31638. "Were you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to the house?
31639. Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl?... Well, if he
31640. had carried you off... do you think they wouldn't have found him?
31641. Your father, or brother, or your betrothed? And he's a scoundrel, a
31642. wretch--that's a fact!"
31643. 
31644. "He is better than any of you!" exclaimed Natasha getting up. "If you
31645. hadn't interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? Sonya,
31646. why?... Go away!"
31647. 
31648. And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people
31649. bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned. Marya
31650. Dmitrievna was to speak again but Natasha cried out:
31651. 
31652. "Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!" and she threw herself
31653. back on the sofa.
31654. 
31655. Marya Dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on her
31656. that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody
31657. would know anything about it if only Natasha herself would undertake
31658. to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened.
31659. Natasha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she grew cold
31660. and had a shivering fit. Marya Dmitrievna put a pillow under her head,
31661. covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower
31662. water, but Natasha did not respond to her.
31663. 
31664. "Well, let her sleep," said Marya Dmitrievna as she went out of the room
31665. supposing Natasha to be asleep.
31666. 
31667. But Natasha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open eyes she
31668. looked straight before her. All that night she did not sleep or weep and
31669. did not speak to Sonya who got up and went to her several times.
31670. 
31671. Next day Count Rostov returned from his estate near Moscow in time for
31672. lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the affair with
31673. the purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was nothing to keep
31674. him any longer in Moscow, away from the countess whom he missed. Marya
31675. Dmitrievna met him and told him that Natasha had been very unwell the
31676. day before and that they had sent for the doctor, but that she was
31677. better now. Natasha had not left her room that morning. With compressed
31678. and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the window, uneasily
31679. watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at
31680. anyone who entered the room. She was evidently expecting news of him and
31681. that he would come or would write to her.
31682. 
31683. When the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound
31684. of a man's footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent
31685. expression. She did not even get up to greet him. "What is the matter
31686. with you, my angel? Are you ill?" asked the count.
31687. 
31688. After a moment's silence Natasha answered: "Yes, ill."
31689. 
31690. In reply to the count's anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected
31691. and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him
31692. that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry. Marya Dmitrievna
31693. confirmed Natasha's assurances that nothing had happened. From
31694. the pretense of illness, from his daughter's distress, and by the
31695. embarrassed faces of Sonya and Marya Dmitrievna, the count saw clearly
31696. that something had gone wrong during his absence, but it was so terrible
31697. for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved
31698. daughter, and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he
31699. avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly
31700. had happened; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition
31701. delayed their return to the country.
31702. 
31703. 
31704. 
31705. 
31706. 
31707. CHAPTER XIX
31708. 
31709. 
31710. From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go
31711. away somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the Rostovs came
31712. to Moscow the effect Natasha had on him made him hasten to carry out
31713. his intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph Alexeevich's widow, who
31714. had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased
31715. husband's.
31716. 
31717. When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Marya
31718. Dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
31719. importance relating to Andrew Bolkonski and his betrothed. Pierre had
31720. been avoiding Natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her
31721. was stronger than a married man's should be for his friend's fiancee.
31722. Yet some fate constantly threw them together.
31723. 
31724. "What can have happened? And what can they want with me?" thought he
31725. as he dressed to go to Marya Dmitrievna's. "If only Prince Andrew would
31726. hurry up and come and marry her!" thought he on his way to the house.
31727. 
31728. On the Tverskoy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.
31729. 
31730. "Pierre! Been back long?" someone shouted. Pierre raised his head. In
31731. a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the
31732. dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Makarin dashed
31733. past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military
31734. dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his
31735. head slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat,
31736. tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled
31737. with powdery snow.
31738. 
31739. "Yes, indeed, that's a true sage," thought Pierre. "He sees nothing
31740. beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so he is
31741. always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldn't I give to be like
31742. him!" he thought enviously.
31743. 
31744. In Marya Dmitrievna's anteroom the footman who helped him off with his
31745. fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.
31746. 
31747. When he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Natasha sitting at the
31748. window, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at him,
31749. frowned, and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.
31750. 
31751. "What has happened?" asked Pierre, entering Marya Dmitrievna's room.
31752. 
31753. "Fine doings!" answered Dmitrievna. "For fifty-eight years have I lived
31754. in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!"
31755. 
31756. And having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him,
31757. Marya Dmitrievna informed him that Natasha had refused Prince Andrew
31758. without her parents' knowledge and that the cause of this was Anatole
31759. Kuragin into whose society Pierre's wife had thrown her and with whom
31760. Natasha had tried to elope during her father's absence, in order to be
31761. married secretly.
31762. 
31763. Pierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was told
31764. him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince Andrew's
31765. deeply loved affianced wife--the same Natasha Rostova who used to be so
31766. charming--should give up Bolkonski for that fool Anatole who was already
31767. secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as
31768. to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive
31769. and could not imagine.
31770. 
31771. He could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Natasha, whom
31772. he had known from a child, with this new conception of her baseness,
31773. folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. "They are all alike!" he
31774. said to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate
31775. enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied Prince Andrew to
31776. the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride, and the more
31777. he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with
31778. disgust of that Natasha who had just passed him in the ballroom with
31779. such a look of cold dignity. He did not know that Natasha's soul was
31780. overflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation, and that it was not
31781. her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity
31782. and severity.
31783. 
31784. "But how get married?" said Pierre, in answer to Marya Dmitrievna. "He
31785. could not marry--he is married!"
31786. 
31787. "Things get worse from hour to hour!" ejaculated Marya Dmitrievna. "A
31788. nice youth! What a scoundrel! And she's expecting him--expecting
31789. him since yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she won't go on
31790. expecting him."
31791. 
31792. After hearing the details of Anatole's marriage from Pierre, and giving
31793. vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, Marya Dmitrievna
31794. told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that the count or
31795. Bolkonski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair
31796. (which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel,
31797. and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to
31798. leave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierre--only
31799. now realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince
31800. Andrew--promised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly
31801. explained her wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.
31802. 
31803. "Mind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,"
31804. she said. "And I will go and tell her it is no use expecting him! And
31805. stay to dinner if you care to!" she called after Pierre.
31806. 
31807. Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning
31808. Natasha had told him that she had rejected Bolkonski.
31809. 
31810. "Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow!" he said to Pierre. "What troubles
31811. one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret having
31812. come here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she has broken
31813. off her engagement without consulting anybody? It's true this engagement
31814. never was much to my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but
31815. still, with his father's disapproval they wouldn't have been happy, and
31816. Natasha won't lack suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and
31817. to take such a step without father's or mother's consent! And now she's
31818. ill, and God knows what! It's hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in
31819. their mother's absence...."
31820. 
31821. Pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the
31822. subject, but the count returned to his troubles.
31823. 
31824. Sonya entered the room with an agitated face.
31825. 
31826. "Natasha is not quite well; she's in her room and would like to see you.
31827. Marya Dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come."
31828. 
31829. "Yes, you are a great friend of Bolkonski's, no doubt she wants to send
31830. him a message," said the count. "Oh dear! Oh dear! How happy it all
31831. was!"
31832. 
31833. And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the
31834. room.
31835. 
31836. When Marya Dmitrievna told Natasha that Anatole was married, Natasha
31837. did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by Pierre
31838. himself. Sonya told Pierre this as she led him along the corridor to
31839. Natasha's room.
31840. 
31841. Natasha, pale and stern, was sitting beside Marya Dmitrievna, and her
31842. eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look the
31843. moment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed fixedly at
31844. him, and her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or like the
31845. others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he evidently did
31846. not exist for her.
31847. 
31848. "He knows all about it," said Marya Dmitrievna pointing to Pierre and
31849. addressing Natasha. "Let him tell you whether I have told the truth."
31850. 
31851. Natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal
31852. looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.
31853. 
31854. "Natalya Ilynichna," Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a feeling of
31855. pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do, "whether it is
31856. true or not should make no difference to you, because..."
31857. 
31858. "Then it is not true that he's married!"
31859. 
31860. "Yes, it is true."
31861. 
31862. "Has he been married long?" she asked. "On your honor?..."
31863. 
31864. Pierre gave his word of honor.
31865. 
31866. "Is he still here?" she asked, quickly.
31867. 
31868. "Yes, I have just seen him."
31869. 
31870. She was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that
31871. they should leave her alone.
31872. 
31873. 
31874. 
31875. 
31876. 
31877. CHAPTER XX
31878. 
31879. 
31880. Pierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at once.
31881. He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kuragin, at the thought of
31882. whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in
31883. breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsies', nor at
31884. Komoneno's. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was going on as
31885. usual. The members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about
31886. in groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town news. The footman
31887. having greeted him, knowing his habits and his acquaintances, told him
31888. there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that Prince
31889. Michael Zakharych was in the library, but Paul Timofeevich had not yet
31890. arrived. One of Pierre's acquaintances, while they were talking about
31891. the weather, asked if he had heard of Kuragin's abduction of Rostova
31892. which was talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and
31893. said it was nonsense for he had just come from the Rostovs'. He asked
31894. everyone about Anatole. One man told him he had not come yet, and
31895. another that he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this
31896. calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his
31897. soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and
31898. as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home.
31899. 
31900. Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with Dolokhov,
31901. consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to
31902. him essential to see Natasha. In the evening he drove to his sister's
31903. to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home
31904. after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince
31905. Anatole was with the countess. The countess' drawing room was full of
31906. guests.
31907. 
31908. Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his
31909. return--at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever--entered
31910. the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.
31911. 
31912. "Ah, Pierre," said the countess going up to her husband. "You don't know
31913. what a plight our Anatole..."
31914. 
31915. She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband's head, in his
31916. glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that
31917. rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his
31918. duel with Dolokhov.
31919. 
31920. "Where you are, there is vice and evil!" said Pierre to his wife.
31921. "Anatole, come with me! I must speak to you," he added in French.
31922. 
31923. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to
31924. follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself
31925. and was leading him from the room.
31926. 
31927. "If you allow yourself in my drawing room..." whispered Helene, but
31928. Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.
31929. 
31930. Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed
31931. anxiety.
31932. 
31933. Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole
31934. without looking at him.
31935. 
31936. "You promised Countess Rostova to marry her and were about to elope with
31937. her, is that so?"
31938. 
31939. "Mon cher," answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French),
31940. "I don't consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that
31941. tone."
31942. 
31943. Pierre's face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole
31944. by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side
31945. to side till Anatole's face showed a sufficient degree of terror.
31946. 
31947. "When I tell you that I must talk to you!..." repeated Pierre.
31948. 
31949. "Come now, this is stupid. What?" said Anatole, fingering a button of
31950. his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.
31951. 
31952. "You're a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don't know what deprives
31953. me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!" said Pierre,
31954. expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.
31955. 
31956. He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put
31957. it back in its place.
31958. 
31959. "Did you promise to marry her?"
31960. 
31961. "I... I didn't think of it. I never promised, because..."
31962. 
31963. Pierre interrupted him.
31964. 
31965. "Have you any letters of hers? Any letters?" he said, moving toward
31966. Anatole.
31967. 
31968. Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket
31969. and drew out his pocketbook.
31970. 
31971. Pierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table
31972. that stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.
31973. 
31974. "I shan't be violent, don't be afraid!" said Pierre in answer to a
31975. frightened gesture of Anatole's. "First, the letters," said he, as if
31976. repeating a lesson to himself. "Secondly," he continued after a short
31977. pause, again rising and again pacing the room, "tomorrow you must get
31978. out of Moscow."
31979. 
31980. "But how can I?..."
31981. 
31982. "Thirdly," Pierre continued without listening to him, "you must never
31983. breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess Rostova.
31984. I know I can't prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark of
31985. conscience..." Pierre paced the room several times in silence.
31986. 
31987. Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.
31988. 
31989. "After all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such
31990. a thing as other people's happiness and peace, and that you are ruining
31991. a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse yourself with women
31992. like my wife--with them you are within your rights, for they know what
31993. you want of them. They are armed against you by the same experience
31994. of debauchery; but to promise a maid to marry her... to deceive, to
31995. kidnap.... Don't you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man
31996. or a child?..."
31997. 
31998. Pierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a
31999. questioning look.
32000. 
32001. "I don't know about that, eh?" said Anatole, growing more confident as
32002. Pierre mastered his wrath. "I don't know that and don't want to," he
32003. said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw,
32004. "but you have used such words to me--'mean' and so on--which as a man of
32005. honor I can't allow anyone to use."
32006. 
32007. Pierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he
32008. wanted.
32009. 
32010. "Though it was tete-a-tete," Anatole continued, "still I can't..."
32011. 
32012. "Is it satisfaction you want?" said Pierre ironically.
32013. 
32014. "You could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do as
32015. you wish, eh?"
32016. 
32017. "I take them back, I take them back!" said Pierre, "and I ask you to
32018. forgive me." Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. "And if
32019. you require money for your journey..."
32020. 
32021. Anatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile, which
32022. Pierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.
32023. 
32024. "Oh, vile and heartless brood!" he exclaimed, and left the room.
32025. 
32026. Next day Anatole left for Petersburg.
32027. 
32028. 
32029. 
32030. 
32031. 
32032. CHAPTER XXI
32033. 
32034. 
32035. Pierre drove to Marya Dmitrievna's to tell her of the fulfillment of her
32036. wish that Kuragin should be banished from Moscow. The whole house was in
32037. a state of alarm and commotion. Natasha was very ill, having, as Marya
32038. Dmitrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the night after she had
32039. been told that Anatole was married, with some arsenic she had stealthily
32040. procured. After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she
32041. woke Sonya and told her what she had done. The necessary antidotes had
32042. been administered in time and she was now out of danger, though still so
32043. weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and
32044. so the countess had been sent for. Pierre saw the distracted count, and
32045. Sonya, who had a tear-stained face, but he could not see Natasha.
32046. 
32047. Pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about
32048. the attempted abduction of Rostova. He resolutely denied these
32049. rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his
32050. brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to
32051. Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish
32052. Natasha's reputation.
32053. 
32054. He was awaiting Prince Andrew's return with dread and went every day to
32055. the old prince's for news of him.
32056. 
32057. Old Prince Bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from
32058. Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which
32059. Natasha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits than
32060. usual and awaited his son with great impatience.
32061. 
32062. Some days after Anatole's departure Pierre received a note from Prince
32063. Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.
32064. 
32065. As soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his
32066. father Natasha's note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement
32067. (Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given
32068. it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of Natasha's
32069. elopement, with additions.
32070. 
32071. Prince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see him next
32072. morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same state
32073. as Natasha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room
32074. to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some
32075. intrigue going on in Petersburg. The old prince's voice and another now
32076. and then interrupted him. Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre. She
32077. sighed, looking toward the door of the room where Prince Andrew was,
32078. evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre
32079. saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the
32080. way her brother had taken the news of Natasha's faithlessness.
32081. 
32082. "He says he expected it," she remarked. "I know his pride will not let
32083. him express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far better,
32084. than I expected. Evidently it had to be...."
32085. 
32086. "But is it possible that all is really ended?" asked Pierre.
32087. 
32088. Princess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand
32089. how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince
32090. Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health, but with a fresh
32091. horizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian dress facing
32092. his father and Prince Meshcherski, warmly disputing and vigorously
32093. gesticulating. The conversation was about Speranski--the news of whose
32094. sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.
32095. 
32096. "Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him
32097. a month ago," Prince Andrew was saying, "and by those who were unable to
32098. understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on
32099. him all the blame of other men's mistakes is very easy, but I maintain
32100. that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by
32101. him, by him alone."
32102. 
32103. He paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately
32104. assumed a vindictive expression.
32105. 
32106. "Posterity will do him justice," he concluded, and at once turned to
32107. Pierre.
32108. 
32109. "Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?" he said with animation, but
32110. the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. "Yes, I am well," he said in
32111. answer to Pierre's question, and smiled.
32112. 
32113. To Pierre that smile said plainly: "I am well, but my health is now of
32114. no use to anyone."
32115. 
32116. After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish
32117. frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and
32118. about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his son's
32119. tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about
32120. Speranski which was still going on between the two old men.
32121. 
32122. "If there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon,
32123. they would have been made public," he said with warmth and haste. "I do
32124. not, and never did, like Speranski personally, but I like justice!"
32125. 
32126. Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too
32127. familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters
32128. in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate.
32129. When Prince Meshcherski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierre's arm and
32130. asked him into the room that had been assigned him. A bed had been made
32131. up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince
32132. Andrew went to one and took out a small casket, from which he drew a
32133. packet wrapped in paper. He did it all silently and very quickly. He
32134. stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.
32135. 
32136. "Forgive me for troubling you..."
32137. 
32138. Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Natasha, and his
32139. broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince
32140. Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued:
32141. 
32142. "I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova and have heard reports
32143. of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that
32144. kind. Is that true?"
32145. 
32146. "Both true and untrue," Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him.
32147. 
32148. "Here are her letters and her portrait," said he.
32149. 
32150. He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.
32151. 
32152. "Give this to the countess... if you see her."
32153. 
32154. "She is very ill," said Pierre.
32155. 
32156. "Then she is here still?" said Prince Andrew. "And Prince Kuragin?" he
32157. added quickly.
32158. 
32159. "He left long ago. She has been at death's door."
32160. 
32161. "I much regret her illness," said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his
32162. father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.
32163. 
32164. "So Monsieur Kuragin has not honored Countess Rostova with his hand?"
32165. said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.
32166. 
32167. "He could not marry, for he was married already," said Pierre.
32168. 
32169. Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father.
32170. 
32171. "And where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?" he said.
32172. 
32173. "He has gone to Peters... But I don't know," said Pierre.
32174. 
32175. "Well, it doesn't matter," said Prince Andrew. "Tell Countess Rostova
32176. that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is
32177. good."
32178. 
32179. Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether
32180. he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say
32181. anything, looked fixedly at him.
32182. 
32183. "I say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?" asked Pierre,
32184. "about..."
32185. 
32186. "Yes," returned Prince Andrew hastily. "I said that a fallen woman
32187. should be forgiven, but I didn't say I could forgive her. I can't."
32188. 
32189. "But can this be compared...?" said Pierre.
32190. 
32191. Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: "Yes, ask her hand
32192. again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but
32193. I am unable to follow in that gentleman's footsteps. If you wish to be
32194. my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So
32195. you'll give her the packet?"
32196. 
32197. Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.
32198. 
32199. The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as
32200. always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her
32201. satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them
32202. Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the
32203. Rostovs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention
32204. the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else.
32205. 
32206. At dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was becoming
32207. evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with his father,
32208. now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an unnatural animation,
32209. the cause of which Pierre so well understood.
32210. 
32211. 
32212. 
32213. 
32214. 
32215. CHAPTER XXII
32216. 
32217. 
32218. That same evening Pierre went to the Rostovs' to fulfill the commission
32219. entrusted to him. Natasha was in bed, the count at the Club, and Pierre,
32220. after giving the letters to Sonya, went to Marya Dmitrievna who was
32221. interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken the news. Ten minutes
32222. later Sonya came to Marya Dmitrievna.
32223. 
32224. "Natasha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirilovich," said she.
32225. 
32226. "But how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not been
32227. tidied up."
32228. 
32229. "No, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room," said Sonya.
32230. 
32231. Marya Dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders.
32232. 
32233. "When will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind, don't
32234. tell her everything!" said she to Pierre. "One hasn't the heart to scold
32235. her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied."
32236. 
32237. Natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, with
32238. a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find
32239. her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently undecided
32240. whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.
32241. 
32242. Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as
32243. usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her arms
32244. hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she
32245. went to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different
32246. expression of face.
32247. 
32248. "Peter Kirilovich," she began rapidly, "Prince Bolkonski was your
32249. friend--is your friend," she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that
32250. everything that had once been must now be different.) "He told me once
32251. to apply to you..."
32252. 
32253. Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then he had
32254. reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he now felt so
32255. sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach.
32256. 
32257. "He is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!" She stopped and
32258. breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.
32259. 
32260. "Yes... I will tell him," answered Pierre; "but..."
32261. 
32262. He did not know what to say.
32263. 
32264. Natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she
32265. had meant.
32266. 
32267. "No, I know all is over," she said hurriedly. "No, that can never be.
32268. I'm only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only that I
32269. beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything...."
32270. 
32271. She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.
32272. 
32273. A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre's heart.
32274. 
32275. "I will tell him, I will tell him everything once more," said Pierre.
32276. "But... I should like to know one thing...."
32277. 
32278. "Know what?" Natasha's eyes asked.
32279. 
32280. "I should like to know, did you love..." Pierre did not know how to
32281. refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him--"did you love that
32282. bad man?"
32283. 
32284. "Don't call him bad!" said Natasha. "But I don't know, don't know at
32285. all...."
32286. 
32287. She began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love
32288. welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and
32289. hoped they would not be noticed.
32290. 
32291. "We won't speak of it any more, my dear," said Pierre, and his gentle,
32292. cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Natasha.
32293. 
32294. "We won't speak of it, my dear--I'll tell him everything; but one thing
32295. I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help, advice, or
32296. simply to open your heart to someone--not now, but when your mind is
32297. clearer think of me!" He took her hand and kissed it. "I shall be happy
32298. if it's in my power..."
32299. 
32300. Pierre grew confused.
32301. 
32302. "Don't speak to me like that. I am not worth it!" exclaimed Natasha and
32303. turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.
32304. 
32305. He knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it he was
32306. amazed at his own words.
32307. 
32308. "Stop, stop! You have your whole life before you," said he to her.
32309. 
32310. "Before me? No! All is over for me," she replied with shame and
32311. self-abasement.
32312. 
32313.  "All over?" he repeated. "If I were not myself, but the handsomest,
32314. cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this moment
32315. ask on my knees for your hand and your love!"
32316. 
32317. For the first time for many days Natasha wept tears of gratitude and
32318. tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.
32319. 
32320. Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom, restraining
32321. tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without finding the
32322. sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh.
32323. 
32324. "Where to now, your excellency?" asked the coachman.
32325. 
32326. "Where to?" Pierre asked himself. "Where can I go now? Surely not to the
32327. Club or to pay calls?" All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in comparison
32328. with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in comparison
32329. with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him through her
32330. tears.
32331. 
32332. "Home!" said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost Fahrenheit
32333. he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the
32334. air with joy.
32335. 
32336. It was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the
32337. black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky
32338. did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane
32339. things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised.
32340. At the entrance to the Arbat Square an immense expanse of dark starry
32341. sky presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it, above the
32342. Prechistenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars
32343. but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white
32344. light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant
32345. comet of 1812--the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes
32346. and the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long
32347. luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed
32348. joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having
32349. traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable
32350. space, seemed suddenly--like an arrow piercing the earth--to remain
32351. fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and
32352. displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars. It
32353. seemed to Pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in
32354. his own softened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into a new life.

32366. CHAPTER I
32367. 
32368. 
32369. From the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating of
32370. the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forces--millions
32371. of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the army--moved from
32372. the west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward which since 1811
32373. Russian forces had been similarly drawn. On the twelfth of June, 1812,
32374. the forces of Western Europe crossed the Russian frontier and war
32375. began, that is, an event took place opposed to human reason and to human
32376. nature. Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable
32377. crimes, frauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money,
32378. burglaries, incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not
32379. recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world, but which
32380. those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes.
32381. 
32382. What produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes? The
32383. historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongs
32384. inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental
32385. System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the
32386. mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.
32387. 
32388. Consequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,
32389. Rumyantsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have
32390. taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to
32391. have written to Alexander: "My respected Brother, I consent to restore
32392. the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg"--and there would have been no war.
32393. 
32394. We can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries.
32395. It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England's
32396. intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It naturally
32397. seemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war
32398. was Napoleon's ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the
32399. war was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the
32400. war was the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals
32401. and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of
32402. giving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the
32403. need of re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of
32404. that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between
32405. Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed
32406. from Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It
32407. is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other
32408. reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points
32409. of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to
32410. posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and
32411. perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem insufficient.
32412. To us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men killed and
32413. tortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander
32414. was firm, or because England's policy was astute or the Duke of
32415. Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances
32416. have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the
32417. Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed
32418. and ruined the people of Smolensk and Moscow and were killed by them.
32419. 
32420. To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried
32421. away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event
32422. with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present
32423. themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of
32424. them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears
32425. to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance
32426. compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence--apart
32427. from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes--to occasion the
32428. event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to
32429. serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon's refusal to
32430. withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of
32431. Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third,
32432. and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have
32433. been so many less men in Napoleon's army and the war could not have
32434. occurred.
32435. 
32436. Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw
32437. beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would
32438. have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second
32439. term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there have been
32440. a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and
32441. had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic
32442. government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent
32443. dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French
32444. Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have
32445. happened. So all these causes--myriads of causes--coincided to bring it
32446. about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had
32447. to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human
32448. feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows,
32449. just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east
32450. to the west, slaying their fellows.
32451. 
32452. The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed
32453. to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was
32454. drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be
32455. otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom
32456. the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of
32457. innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event
32458. could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in
32459. whose hands lay the real power--the soldiers who fired, or transported
32460. provisions and guns--should consent to carry out the will of these weak
32461. individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number
32462. of diverse and complex causes.
32463. 
32464. We are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational
32465. events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of which we do
32466. not understand). The more we try to explain such events in history
32467. reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to
32468. us.
32469. 
32470. Each man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal
32471. aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from
32472. doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that action
32473. performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to
32474. history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.
32475. 
32476. There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life, which
32477. is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental hive
32478. life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him.
32479. 
32480. Man lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument in
32481. the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. A deed done
32482. is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of
32483. millions of other men assumes an historic significance. The higher a man
32484. stands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with
32485. and the more power he has over others, the more evident is the
32486. predestination and inevitability of his every action.
32487. 
32488. "The king's heart is in the hands of the Lord."
32489. 
32490. A king is history's slave.
32491. 
32492. History, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind, uses
32493. every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.
32494. 
32495. Though Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever that
32496. it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses peuples
32497. *--as Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him--he had
32498. never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which compelled him,
32499. while thinking that he was acting on his own volition, to perform
32500. for the hive life--that is to say, for history--whatever had to be
32501. performed.
32502. 
32503. 
32504.     * "To shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples."
32505. 
32506. 
32507. The people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and
32508. by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and
32509. co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the
32510. nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg's
32511. wrongs, the movement of troops into Prussia--undertaken (as it seemed
32512. to Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace, the
32513. French Emperor's love and habit of war coinciding with his people's
32514. inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, and the
32515. expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages
32516. to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors he received
32517. in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the opinion of
32518. contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace,
32519. but which only wounded the self-love of both sides, and millions of
32520. other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or
32521. coincided with it.
32522. 
32523. When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its
32524. attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried
32525. by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or
32526. because the boy standing below wants to eat it?
32527. 
32528. Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in
32529. which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist
32530. who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so
32531. forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says
32532. the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it. Equally
32533. right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he
32534. wanted to, and perished because Alexander desired his destruction, and
32535. he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because
32536. the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock. In historic
32537. events the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and
32538. like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself.
32539. 
32540. Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is
32541. in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of
32542. history and predestined from eternity.
32543. 
32544. 
32545. 
32546. 
32547. 
32548. CHAPTER II
32549. 
32550. 
32551. On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent
32552. three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings,
32553. and even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the
32554. emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings
32555. and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds
32556. of his own--that is, which he had taken from other kings--to the Empress
32557. of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced
32558. the Empress Marie Louise--who regarded him as her husband, though he had
32559. left another wife in Paris--left her grieved by the parting which
32560. she seemed hardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly
32561. believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end,
32562. and though the Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander,
32563. calling him Monsieur mon frere, and sincerely assured him that he did
32564. not want war and would always love and honor him--yet he set off to
32565. join his army, and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the
32566. movement of his troops from west to east. He went in a traveling coach
32567. with six horses, surrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort,
32568. along the road to Posen, Thorn, Danzig, and Konigsberg. At each of these
32569. towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm.
32570. 
32571. The army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses carried
32572. him in the same direction. On the tenth of June, * coming up with the
32573. army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of
32574. a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.
32575. 
32576. 
32577.     * Old style.
32578. 
32579. 
32580. Next day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the Niemen, and,
32581. changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in order to
32582. select a place for the crossing.
32583. 
32584. Seeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the
32585. wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow
32586. (Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the Scythia
32587. into which Alexander the Great had marched--Napoleon unexpectedly, and
32588. contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an
32589. advance, and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen.
32590. 
32591. Early in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent,
32592. which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and
32593. looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of
32594. the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across
32595. the river. The troops, knowing of the Emperor's presence, were on the
32596. lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat
32597. and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on
32598. the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: "Vive l'Empereur!" and
32599. one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest
32600. that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three
32601. bridges to the other side.
32602. 
32603. "Now we'll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself, things
32604. get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive l'Empereur! So these
32605. are the steppes of Asia! It's a nasty country all the same. Au revoir,
32606. Beauche; I'll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au revoir. Good
32607. luck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive l'Empereur!... preur!--If
32608. they make me Governor of India, Gerard, I'll make you Minister of
32609. Kashmir--that's settled. Vive l'Empereur! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! The
32610. Cossacks--those rascals--see how they run! Vive l'Empereur! There he
32611. is, do you see him? I've seen him twice, as I see you now. The little
32612. corporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the veterans.... Vive
32613. l'Empereur!" came the voices of men, old and young, of most diverse
32614. characters and social positions. On the faces of all was one common
32615. expression of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and
32616. of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on
32617. the hill.
32618. 
32619. On the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse was
32620. brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the
32621. bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous
32622. acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible
32623. to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting,
32624. but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and
32625. distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the
32626. time he joined the army. He rode across one of the swaying pontoon
32627. bridges to the farther side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in
32628. the direction of Kovno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the
32629. Guard who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for
32630. him through the troops. On reaching the broad river Viliya, he stopped
32631. near a regiment of Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.
32632. 
32633. "Vivat!" shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and
32634. pressing against one another to see him.
32635. 
32636. Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log
32637. that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed
32638. him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him,
32639. and he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became absorbed in a map laid
32640. out on the logs. Without lifting his head he said something, and two of
32641. his aides-de-camp galloped off to the Polish Uhlans.
32642. 
32643. "What? What did he say?" was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans
32644. when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.
32645. 
32646. The order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel of the
32647. Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his speech
32648. from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be permitted
32649. to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford. In evident
32650. fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, he
32651. begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperor's
32652. eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor would not be
32653. displeased at this excess of zeal.
32654. 
32655. As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer,
32656. with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted "Vivat!"
32657. and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped
32658. into the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown
32659. restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest
32660. part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after
32661. him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the
32662. stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their
32663. horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others
32664. tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses'
32665. manes. They tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and,
32666. though there was a ford one third of a mile away, were proud that they
32667. were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who
32668. sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing. When
32669. the aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment,
32670. ventured to draw the Emperor's attention to the devotion of the Poles
32671. to his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having
32672. summoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving
32673. him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the
32674. drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.
32675. 
32676. For him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of
32677. the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to
32678. dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called for
32679. his horse and rode to his quarters.
32680. 
32681. Some forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to
32682. their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from which
32683. they had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and with
32684. difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they had
32685. got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted "Vivat!"
32686. and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he
32687. no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.
32688. 
32689. That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper
32690. money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as
32691. possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter
32692. containing information about the orders to the French army had been
32693. found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish colonel who
32694. had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the Legion
32695. d'honneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.

32706. CHAPTER III
32707. 
32708. 
32709. The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in Vilna for more than a
32710. month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for the
32711. war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come
32712. from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The vacillation
32713. between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after
32714. the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each of the three
32715. armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no supreme
32716. commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume that
32717. responsibility himself.
32718. 
32719. The longer the Emperor remained in Vilna the less did everybody--tired
32720. of waiting--prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who surrounded
32721. the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time
32722. pleasantly and forget that war was impending.
32723. 
32724. In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by the
32725. courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the Polish
32726. aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for
32727. the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly received.
32728. The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected money by
32729. subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the
32730. Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a
32731. landowner in the Vilna province, offered his country house for the fete,
32732. and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and
32733. fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsen's country seat.
32734. 
32735. The very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and
32736. his vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian frontier,
32737. Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his
32738. aides-de-camp at Bennigsen's country house.
32739. 
32740. It was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters declared
32741. that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place.
32742. Countess Bezukhova was present among other Russian ladies who had
32743. followed the sovereign from Petersburg to Vilna and eclipsed the refined
32744. Polish ladies by her massive, so called Russian type of beauty. The
32745. Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.
32746. 
32747. Boris Drubetskoy, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the
32748. present en garcon (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not an
32749. aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. Boris
32750. was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought
32751. patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his
32752. own age. He was meeting Helene in Vilna after not having seen her for
32753. a long time and did not recall the past, but as Helene was enjoying
32754. the favors of a very important personage and Boris had only recently
32755. married, they met as good friends of long standing.
32756. 
32757. At midnight dancing was still going on. Helene, not having a suitable
32758. partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with Boris. They were the
32759. third couple. Boris, coolly looking at Helene's dazzling bare shoulders
32760. which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her
32761. of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and
32762. unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor
32763. who was in the same room. The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the
32764. doorway, stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which
32765. he alone knew how to utter.
32766. 
32767. As the mazurka began, Boris saw that Adjutant General Balashev, one of
32768. those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him and contrary
32769. to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a Polish
32770. lady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked inquiringly
32771. at Balashev and, evidently understanding that he only acted thus because
32772. there were important reasons for so doing, nodded slightly to the lady
32773. and turned to him. Hardly had Balashev begun to speak before a look of
32774. amazement appeared on the Emperor's face. He took Balashev by the arm
32775. and crossed the room with him, unconsciously clearing a path seven
32776. yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him. Boris noticed
32777. Arakcheev's excited face when the sovereign went out with Balashev.
32778. Arakcheev looked at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with
32779. his red nose, stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor
32780. to address him. (Boris understood that Arakcheev envied Balashev and
32781. was displeased that evidently important news had reached the Emperor
32782. otherwise than through himself.)
32783. 
32784. But the Emperor and Balashev passed out into the illuminated garden
32785. without noticing Arakcheev who, holding his sword and glancing
32786. wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.
32787. 
32788. All the time Boris was going through the figures of the mazurka, he was
32789. worried by the question of what news Balashev had brought and how he
32790. could find it out before others. In the figure in which he had to choose
32791. two ladies, he whispered to Helene that he meant to choose Countess
32792. Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the veranda, and glided over
32793. the parquet to the door opening into the garden, where, seeing Balashev
32794. and the Emperor returning to the veranda, he stood still. They were
32795. moving toward the door. Boris, fluttering as if he had not had time to
32796. withdraw, respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head.
32797. 
32798. The Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally
32799. affronted, was finishing with these words:
32800. 
32801. "To enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as long as
32802. a single armed enemy remains in my country!" It seemed to Boris that it
32803. gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was satisfied with
32804. the form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but displeased that
32805. Boris had overheard it.
32806. 
32807. "Let no one know of it!" the Emperor added with a frown.
32808. 
32809. Boris understood that this was meant for him and, closing his eyes,
32810. slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and
32811. remained there about another half-hour.
32812. 
32813. Boris was thus the first to learn the news that the French army had
32814. crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain
32815. important personages that much that was concealed from others was
32816. usually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their
32817. estimation.
32818. 
32819. 
32820. The unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was
32821. particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations, and at
32822. a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of indignation
32823. and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully
32824. expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On returning home
32825. at two o'clock that night he sent for his secretary, Shishkov, and told
32826. him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal
32827. Prince Saltykov, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that
32828. he would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on
32829. Russian soil.
32830. 
32831. Next day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:
32832. 
32833. 
32834. Monsieur mon frere,
32835. 
32836. Yesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept
32837. my engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian
32838. frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in
32839. which Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression, that
32840. Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me
32841. from the time Prince Kuragin asked for his passports. The reasons on
32842. which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would
32843. never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for
32844. aggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has declared, was
32845. never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I was informed of
32846. it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain
32847. at his post. If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our
32848. peoples for such a misunderstanding, and consents to withdraw your
32849. troops from Russian territory, I will regard what has passed as not
32850. having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible. In
32851. the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see myself forced to repel an
32852. attack that nothing on my part has provoked. It still depends on Your
32853. Majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war. I am,
32854. etc.,
32855. 
32856. (signed) Alexander.
32857. 
32858. 
32859. 
32860. 
32861. 
32862. CHAPTER IV
32863. 
32864. 
32865. At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having
32866. sent for Balashev and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him to
32867. take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When dispatching
32868. Balashev, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make
32869. peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told
32870. him to transmit those words to Napoleon. Alexander did not insert them
32871. in his letter to Napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt
32872. it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at
32873. reconciliation was being made, but he definitely instructed Balashev to
32874. repeat them personally to Napoleon.
32875. 
32876. Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a
32877. bugler and two Cossacks, Balashev reached the French outposts at the
32878. village of Rykonty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn. There he
32879. was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.
32880. 
32881. A French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a
32882. shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balashev to halt. Balashev did
32883. not do so at once, but continued to advance along the road at a walking
32884. pace.
32885. 
32886. The noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,
32887. advanced his horse's chest against Balashev, put his hand to his saber,
32888. and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he deaf that
32889. he did not do as he was told? Balashev mentioned who he was. The
32890. noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental
32891. matters without looking at the Russian general.
32892. 
32893. After living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after
32894. conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in general
32895. being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service, Balashev
32896. found it very strange here on Russian soil to encounter this hostile,
32897. and still more this disrespectful, application of brute force to
32898. himself.
32899. 
32900. The sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air was
32901. fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from
32902. the village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one after
32903. another, like bubbles rising in water.
32904. 
32905. Balashev looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the
32906. village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked
32907. silently at one another from time to time.
32908. 
32909. A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came
32910. riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied
32911. by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their horses all looked
32912. smart and well kept.
32913. 
32914. It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
32915. trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of
32916. martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit
32917. of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.
32918. 
32919. The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was polite and
32920. evidently understood Balashev's importance. He led him past his soldiers
32921. and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to
32922. the Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately, as the Emperor's
32923. quarters were, he believed, not far off.
32924. 
32925. They rode through the village of Rykonty, past tethered French hussar
32926. horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with
32927. curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the other end of the
32928. village. The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile
32929. and a quarter away and would receive Balashev and conduct him to his
32930. destination.
32931. 
32932. The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.
32933. 
32934. They had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a group
32935. of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a black horse
32936. with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes
32937. in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders. He wore a red
32938. mantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion. This man
32939. rode toward Balashev at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and
32940. gold lace glittering in the bright June sunshine.
32941. 
32942. Balashev was only two horses' length from the equestrian with the
32943. bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping
32944. toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the
32945. French colonel, whispered respectfully: "The King of Naples!" It was,
32946. in fact, Murat, now called "King of Naples." Though it was quite
32947. incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he was called so,
32948. and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore assumed a more
32949. solemn and important air than formerly. He was so sure that he really
32950. was the King of Naples that when, on the eve of his departure from that
32951. city, while walking through the streets with his wife, some Italians
32952. called out to him: "Viva il re!" * he turned to his wife with a pensive
32953. smile and said: "Poor fellows, they don't know that I am leaving them
32954. tomorrow!"
32955. 
32956. 
32957.     * "Long live the king."
32958. 
32959. 
32960. But though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and pitied
32961. the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he
32962. had been ordered to return to military service--and especially since his
32963. last interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when his august brother-in-law
32964. had told him: "I made you King that you should reign in my way, but not
32965. in yours!"--he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business, and--like
32966. a well-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows
32967. skittish between the shafts--he dressed up in clothes as variegated
32968. and expensive as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the
32969. roads of Poland, without himself knowing why or whither.
32970. 
32971. On seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its long hair
32972. curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked
32973. inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully informed His
32974. Majesty of Balashev's mission, whose name he could not pronounce.
32975. 
32976. "De Bal-macheve!" said the King (overcoming by his assurance the
32977. difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). "Charmed to
32978. make your acquaintance, General!" he added, with a gesture of kingly
32979. condescension.
32980. 
32981. As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity
32982. instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his
32983. natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the
32984. withers of Balashev's horse and said:
32985. 
32986. "Well, General, it all looks like war," as if regretting a circumstance
32987. of which he was unable to judge.
32988. 
32989. "Your Majesty," replied Balashev, "my master, the Emperor, does not
32990. desire war and as Your Majesty sees..." said Balashev, using the words
32991. Your Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation unavoidable in
32992. frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty.
32993. 
32994. Murat's face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to "Monsieur
32995. de Bal-macheve." But royaute oblige! * and he felt it incumbent on
32996. him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with Alexander's
32997. envoy. He dismounted, took Balashev's arm, and moving a few steps away
32998. from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to pace up and down
32999. with him, trying to speak significantly. He referred to the fact that
33000. the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his
33001. troops from Prussia, especially when that demand became generally known
33002. and the dignity of France was thereby offended.
33003. 
33004. 
33005.     * "Royalty has its obligations."
33006. 
33007. 
33008. Balashev replied that there was "nothing offensive in the demand,
33009. because..." but Murat interrupted him.
33010. 
33011. "Then you don't consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?" he asked
33012. unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.
33013. 
33014. Balashev told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of the
33015. war.
33016. 
33017. "Oh, my dear general!" Murat again interrupted him, "with all my heart I
33018. wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and that the war
33019. begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!" said he,
33020. in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another
33021. despite a quarrel between their masters.
33022. 
33023. And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his
33024. health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent
33025. with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal dignity,
33026. Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which he had stood
33027. at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:
33028. 
33029. "I won't detain you longer, General. I wish success to your mission,"
33030. and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his
33031. glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully
33032. awaiting him.
33033. 
33034. Balashev rode on, supposing from Murat's words that he would very soon
33035. be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the next
33036. village the sentinels of Davout's infantry corps detained him as
33037. the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the corps
33038. commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to Marshal
33039. Davout.
33040. 
33041. 
33042. 
33043. 
33044. 
33045. CHAPTER V
33046. 
33047. 
33048. Davout was to Napoleon what Arakcheev was to Alexander--though not a
33049. coward like Arakcheev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to
33050. express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.
33051. 
33052. In the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are
33053. necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always
33054. appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and their
33055. proximity to the head of the government may be. This inevitability alone
33056. can explain how the cruel Arakcheev, who tore out a grenadier's mustache
33057. with his own hands, whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face
33058. danger, and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier, was able to
33059. maintain his powerful position with Alexander, whose own character was
33060. chivalrous, noble, and gentle.
33061. 
33062. Balashev found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasant's hut,
33063. writing--he was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been
33064. found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put
33065. themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for
33066. being gloomy. For the same reason they are always hard at work and in a
33067. hurry. "How can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I
33068. am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?" the expression of
33069. his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men,
33070. when they encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their own
33071. dreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure when
33072. Balashev was brought in. He became still more absorbed in his task when
33073. the Russian general entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at
33074. Balashev's face, which was animated by the beauty of the morning and
33075. by his talk with Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still
33076. more and sneered malevolently.
33077. 
33078. When he noticed in Balashev's face the disagreeable impression this
33079. reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he
33080. wanted.
33081. 
33082. Thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because
33083. Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor
33084. Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, Balashev hastened to inform
33085. him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, after
33086. hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.
33087. 
33088. "Where is your dispatch?" he inquired. "Give it to me. I will send it to
33089. the Emperor."
33090. 
33091. Balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the
33092. Emperor.
33093. 
33094. "Your Emperor's orders are obeyed in your army, but here," said Davout,
33095. "you must do as you're told."
33096. 
33097. And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his
33098. dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer
33099. on duty.
33100. 
33101. Balashev took out the packet containing the Emperor's letter and laid it
33102. on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid
33103. across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the inscription.
33104. 
33105. "You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,"
33106. protested Balashev, "but permit me to observe that I have the honor to
33107. be adjutant general to His Majesty...."
33108. 
33109. Davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the
33110. signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balashev's face.
33111. 
33112. "You will be treated as is fitting," said he and, putting the packet in
33113. his pocket, left the shed.
33114. 
33115. A minute later the marshal's adjutant, de Castres, came in and conducted
33116. Balashev to the quarters assigned him.
33117. 
33118. That day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the barrels.
33119. 
33120. Next day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balashev to come to
33121. him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the
33122. baggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one
33123. except Monsieur de Castres.
33124. 
33125. After four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his impotence
33126. and insignificance--particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of
33127. power in which he had so lately moved--and after several marches with
33128. the marshal's baggage and the French army, which occupied the
33129. whole district, Balashev was brought to Vilna--now occupied by the
33130. French--through the very gate by which he had left it four days
33131. previously.
33132. 
33133. Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, came
33134. to Balashev and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon's wish to honor him
33135. with an audience.
33136. 
33137. Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhensk regiment had stood in
33138. front of the house to which Balashev was conducted, and now two French
33139. grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with
33140. shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a
33141. brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting
33142. for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle
33143. horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Balashev in the very
33144. house in Vilna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission.
33145. 
33146. 
33147. 
33148. 
33149. 
33150. CHAPTER VI
33151. 
33152. 
33153. Though Balashev was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury
33154. and magnificence of Napoleon's court.
33155. 
33156. The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many
33157. generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates--several of whom
33158. Balashev had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia--were waiting.
33159. Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going
33160. for his ride.
33161. 
33162. After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into
33163. the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balashev to follow
33164. him.
33165. 
33166. Balashev went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a
33167. study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him
33168. on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried
33169. footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all
33170. was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps,
33171. firm and resolute--they were those of Napoleon. He had just finished
33172. dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over
33173. a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white
33174. leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and
33175. Hessian boots. His short hair had evidently just been brushed, but one
33176. lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead. His plump white neck
33177. stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled
33178. of Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-looking, with its
33179. prominent chin, wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial
33180. welcome.
33181. 
33182. He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head slightly
33183. thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick
33184. shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had that
33185. imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in
33186. comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits that
33187. day.
33188. 
33189. He nodded in answer to Balashav's low and respectful bow, and coming up
33190. to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his
33191. time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure
33192. he will always say the right thing and say it well.
33193. 
33194. "Good day, General!" said he. "I have received the letter you brought
33195. from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you." He glanced with
33196. his large eyes into Balashav's face and immediately looked past him.
33197. 
33198. It was plain that Balashev's personality did not interest him at all.
33199. Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him.
33200. Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because everything
33201. in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his will.
33202. 
33203. "I do not, and did not, desire war," he continued, "but it has been
33204. forced on me. Even now" (he emphasized the word) "I am ready to receive
33205. any explanations you can give me."
33206. 
33207. And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
33208. dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly
33209. moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balashev
33210. was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into
33211. negotiations.
33212. 
33213. When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the
33214. Russian envoy, Balashev began a speech he had prepared long before:
33215. "Sire! The Emperor, my master..." but the sight of the Emperor's eyes
33216. bent on him confused him. "You are flurried--compose yourself!" Napoleon
33217. seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at
33218. Balashev's uniform and sword.
33219. 
33220. Balashev recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the
33221. Emperor Alexander did not consider Kurakin's demand for his passports a
33222. sufficient cause for war; that Kurakin had acted on his own initiative
33223. and without his sovereign's assent, that the Emperor Alexander did not
33224. desire war, and had no relations with England.
33225. 
33226. "Not yet!" interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his
33227. feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balashev might
33228. proceed.
33229. 
33230. After saying all he had been instructed to say, Balashev added that
33231. the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter into
33232. negotiations except on condition that... Here Balashev hesitated:
33233. he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his
33234. letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykov and had
33235. told Balashev to repeat to Napoleon. Balashev remembered these words,
33236. "So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil," but some
33237. complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though he
33238. wished to do so. He grew confused and said: "On condition that the
33239. French army retires beyond the Niemen."
33240. 
33241. Napoleon noticed Balashev's embarrassment when uttering these last
33242. words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver
33243. rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in
33244. a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that
33245. followed, Balashev, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily
33246. noticed the quivering of Napoleon's left leg which increased the more
33247. Napoleon raised his voice.
33248. 
33249. "I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander," he began. "Have
33250. I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I
33251. have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin
33252. negotiations, what is demanded of me?" he said, frowning and making an
33253. energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.
33254. 
33255. "The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire," replied Balashev.
33256. 
33257. "The Niemen?" repeated Napoleon. "So now you want me to retire beyond
33258. the Niemen--only the Niemen?" repeated Napoleon, looking straight at
33259. Balashev.
33260. 
33261. The latter bowed his head respectfully.
33262. 
33263. Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania,
33264. only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned
33265. quickly and began to pace the room.
33266. 
33267. "You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen
33268. before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago
33269. the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder,
33270. and yet you are willing to negotiate."
33271. 
33272. He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again
33273. stopped in front of Balashev. Balashev noticed that his left leg was
33274. quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern
33275. expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was
33276. conscious of. "The vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,"
33277. he remarked at a later date.
33278. 
33279. "Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to a
33280. Prince of Baden, but not to me!" Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his
33281. own surprise. "If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept
33282. such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his
33283. army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I
33284. have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when
33285. your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the
33286. aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?" he continued
33287. hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace
33288. and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and
33289. power and Alexander's errors and duplicity.
33290. 
33291. The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the
33292. intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing
33293. that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking,
33294. and the more he talked the less could he control his words.
33295. 
33296. The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and
33297. insult Alexander--just what he had least desired at the commencement of
33298. the interview.
33299. 
33300. "I hear you have made peace with Turkey?"
33301. 
33302. Balashev bowed his head affirmatively.
33303. 
33304. "Peace has been concluded..." he began.
33305. 
33306. But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the
33307. talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and
33308. unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.
33309. 
33310. "Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining
33311. Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those
33312. provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes," he went on, "I promised and would
33313. have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he
33314. won't have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to
33315. his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia from the
33316. Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could
33317. not have done more," said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he
33318. paced up and down the room, repeating to Balashev almost the very words
33319. he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. "All that, he would have
33320. owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!" he repeated several
33321. times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to
33322. his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.
33323. 
33324. "What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander's might have been!"
33325. 
33326. He looked compassionately at Balashev, and as soon as the latter tried
33327. to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.
33328. 
33329. "What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained
33330. through my friendship?" demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders
33331. in perplexity. "But no, he has preferred to surround himself with
33332. my enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and
33333. Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;
33334. Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French
33335. subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all
33336. the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who
33337. should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander's mind....
33338. Granted that were they competent they might be made use of," continued
33339. Napoleon--hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts
33340. that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his
33341. perception the two were one and the same)--"but they are not even that!
33342. They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be the
33343. most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first
33344. movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel proposes,
33345. Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act,
33346. does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result.
33347. Bagration alone is a military man. He's stupid, but he has experience,
33348. a quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your young monarch
33349. playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on him
33350. the responsibility for all that happens. A sovereign should not be with
33351. the army unless he is a general!" said Napoleon, evidently uttering
33352. these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander
33353. desired to be a military commander.
33354. 
33355. "The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven't even been able to
33356. defend Vilna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish
33357. provinces. Your army is grumbling."
33358. 
33359. "On the contrary, Your Majesty," said Balashev, hardly able to remember
33360. what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with
33361. difficulty, "the troops are burning with eagerness..."
33362. 
33363. "I know everything!" Napoleon interrupted him. "I know everything. I
33364. know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have
33365. not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give
33366. you my word of honor," said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor
33367. could carry no weight--"I give you my word of honor that I have five
33368. hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will
33369. be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making
33370. peace with you. As for the Swedes--it is their fate to be governed
33371. by mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for
33372. another--Bernadotte, who promptly went mad--for no Swede would ally
33373. himself with Russia unless he were mad."
33374. 
33375. Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.
33376. 
33377. Balashev knew how to reply to each of Napoleon's remarks, and would
33378. have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say
33379. something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity
33380. of the Swedes, Balashev wished to reply that when Russia is on her side
33381. Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation
33382. to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which
33383. a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is
33384. in the right. Balashev began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared
33385. to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man,
33386. he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently
33387. seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon
33388. had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them
33389. when he came to his senses. Balashev stood with downcast eyes, looking
33390. at the movements of Napoleon's stout legs and trying to avoid meeting
33391. his eyes.
33392. 
33393. "But what do I care about your allies?" said Napoleon. "I have
33394. allies--the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like
33395. lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them."
33396. 
33397. And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this
33398. obvious falsehood, and that Balashev still stood silently before him in
33399. the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned
33400. round, drew close to Balashev's face, and, gesticulating rapidly and
33401. energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:
33402. 
33403. "Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I'll wipe it off the map
33404. of Europe!" he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he
33405. struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. "Yes, I
33406. will throw you back beyond the Dvina and beyond the Dnieper, and will
33407. re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of
33408. Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you.
33409. That is what you have gained by alienating me!" And he walked silently
33410. several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching.
33411. 
33412. He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted
33413. it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balashev. He
33414. paused, looked ironically straight into Balashev's eyes, and said in a
33415. quiet voice:
33416. 
33417. "And yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!"
33418. 
33419. Balashev, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the
33420. Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was
33421. silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to
33422. him. Balashev said that in Russia the best results were expected from
33423. the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, "I know it's
33424. your duty to say that, but you don't believe it yourself. I have
33425. convinced you."
33426. 
33427. When Balashev had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed
33428. at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door
33429. opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor
33430. his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon,
33431. without giving them a glance, turned to Balashev:
33432. 
33433. "Assure the Emperor Alexander from me," said he, taking his hat, "that
33434. I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly
33435. esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you
33436. shall receive my letter to the Emperor."
33437. 
33438. And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room
33439. rushed forward and descended the staircase.
33440. 
33441. 
33442. 
33443. 
33444. 
33445. CHAPTER VII
33446. 
33447. 
33448. After all that Napoleon had said to him--those bursts of anger and the
33449. last dryly spoken words: "I will detain you no longer, General; you
33450. shall receive my letter," Balashev felt convinced that Napoleon would
33451. not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him--an
33452. insulted envoy--especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But,
33453. to his surprise, Balashev received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine
33454. with the Emperor that day.
33455. 
33456. Bessieres, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.
33457. 
33458. Napoleon met Balashev cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign
33459. of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,
33460. but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashev. It was evident that
33461. he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a
33462. mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not
33463. because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he
33464. did it.
33465. 
33466. The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vilna, where
33467. crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. From all
33468. the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his
33469. monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved
33470. their handkerchiefs to him.
33471. 
33472. At dinner, having placed Balashev beside him, Napoleon not only treated
33473. him amiably but behaved as if Balashev were one of his own courtiers,
33474. one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at
33475. his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and
33476. questioned Balashev about the Russian capital, not merely as an
33477. interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as
33478. if convinced that Balashev, as a Russian, must be flattered by his
33479. curiosity.
33480. 
33481. "How many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it true
33482. that Moscow is called 'Holy Moscow'? How many churches are there in
33483. Moscow?" he asked.
33484. 
33485. And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches,
33486. he remarked:
33487. 
33488. "Why such a quantity of churches?"
33489. 
33490. "The Russians are very devout," replied Balashev.
33491. 
33492. "But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the
33493. backwardness of a people," said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for
33494. appreciation of this remark.
33495. 
33496. Balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.
33497. 
33498. "Every country has its own character," said he.
33499. 
33500. "But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that," said Napoleon.
33501. 
33502. "I beg your Majesty's pardon," returned Balashev, "besides Russia there
33503. is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries."
33504. 
33505. This reply of Balashev's, which hinted at the recent defeats of the
33506. French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander's
33507. court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon's dinner, where it
33508. passed unnoticed.
33509. 
33510. The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they
33511. were puzzled as to what Balashev's tone suggested. "If there is a point
33512. we don't see it, or it is not at all witty," their expressions seemed
33513. to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not
33514. notice it at all and naively asked Balashev through what towns the
33515. direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balashev, who was on the alert
33516. all through the dinner, replied that just as "all roads lead to Rome,"
33517. so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and "among them the
33518. road through Poltava, which Charles XII chose." Balashev involuntarily
33519. flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had
33520. he uttered the word Poltava before Caulaincourt began speaking of the
33521. badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg
33522. reminiscences.
33523. 
33524. After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon's study, which four
33525. days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat
33526. down, toying with his Sevres coffee cup, and motioned Balashev to a
33527. chair beside him.
33528. 
33529. Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than
33530. any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to
33531. consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded
33532. by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner,
33533. Balashev too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a
33534. pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.
33535. 
33536. "They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange,
33537. isn't it, General?" he said, evidently not doubting that this remark
33538. would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleon's,
33539. superiority to Alexander.
33540. 
33541. Balashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence.
33542. 
33543. "Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were
33544. deliberating," continued Napoleon with the same derisive and
33545. self-confident smile. "What I can't understand," he went on, "is that
33546. the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies.
33547. That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do the same?"
33548. and he turned inquiringly to Balashev, and evidently this thought turned
33549. him back on to the track of his morning's anger, which was still fresh
33550. in him.
33551. 
33552. "And let him know that I will do so!" said Napoleon, rising and pushing
33553. his cup away with his hand. "I'll drive all his Wurttemberg, Baden, and
33554. Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I'll drive them out. Let him
33555. prepare an asylum for them in Russia!"
33556. 
33557. Balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to
33558. make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help
33559. hearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression;
33560. he treated Balashev not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man
33561. now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master's
33562. humiliation.
33563. 
33564. "And why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What is
33565. the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to reign
33566. and not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a
33567. responsibility?"
33568. 
33569. Again Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up and down
33570. the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to
33571. Balashev and with a slight smile, as confidently, quickly, and simply
33572. as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to
33573. Balashev, he raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian general's
33574. face and, taking him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling with his lips
33575. only.
33576. 
33577. To have one's ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest
33578. honor and mark of favor at the French court.
33579. 
33580. "Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don't you say
33581. anything?" said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the
33582. adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. "Are the horses
33583. ready for the general?" he added, with a slight inclination of his head
33584. in reply to Balashev's bow. "Let him have mine, he has a long way to
33585. go!"
33586. 
33587. The letter taken by Balashev was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander.
33588. Every detail of the interview was communicated to the Russian monarch,
33589. and the war began...
33590. 
33591. 
33592. 
33593. 
33594. 
33595. CHAPTER VIII
33596. 
33597. 
33598. After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to
33599. Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet
33600. Anatole Kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching
33601. Petersburg he inquired for Kuragin but the latter had already left the
33602. city. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on
33603. his track. Anatole Kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from
33604. the Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in
33605. Petersburg Prince Andrew met Kutuzov, his former commander who was
33606. always well disposed toward him, and Kutuzov suggested that he should
33607. accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general had
33608. been appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having received an
33609. appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.
33610. 
33611. Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge Kuragin.
33612. He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might
33613. compromise the young Countess Rostova and so he wanted to meet Kuragin
33614. personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again
33615. failed to meet Kuragin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived,
33616. the latter returned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions,
33617. Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken
33618. faith with him--which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to
33619. conceal its effects--the surroundings in which he had been happy became
33620. trying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized
33621. so highly were still more so. Not only could he no longer think the
33622. thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the
33623. field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and which
33624. had filled his solitude at Bogucharovo and then in Switzerland and Rome,
33625. but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons
33626. they had revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical
33627. matters unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more
33628. eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if
33629. that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him
33630. had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in
33631. which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.
33632. 
33633. Of the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was the
33634. simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kutuzov's staff,
33635. he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised
33636. Kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not having found
33637. Kuragin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back
33638. to Russia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might
33639. be before he met Kuragin, despite his contempt for him and despite all
33640. the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping
33641. to a conflict with him--he knew that when he did meet him he would not
33642. be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help
33643. snatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet
33644. avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and
33645. poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in
33646. Turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and
33647. ambitious activity.
33648. 
33649. In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached
33650. Bucharest--where Kutuzov had been living for two months, passing his
33651. days and nights with a Wallachian woman--Prince Andrew asked Kutuzov
33652. to transfer him to the Western Army. Kutuzov, who was already weary of
33653. Bolkonski's activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very
33654. readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.
33655. 
33656. Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at
33657. Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way,
33658. being only two miles off the Smolensk highroad. During the last three
33659. years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt,
33660. and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that
33661. on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find
33662. the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail.
33663. He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up
33664. the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted,
33665. sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the
33666. same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture,
33667. the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only
33668. somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden
33669. getting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of
33670. her life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was
33671. the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her
33672. existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become
33673. more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had
33674. brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and
33675. talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly
33676. intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince
33677. had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a
33678. noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was the same as
33679. ever, only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was
33680. happening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had changed. He had grown,
33681. become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, quite
33682. unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just
33683. as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the law of
33684. immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. But though externally
33685. all remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had
33686. changed since Prince Andrew had seen them last. The household was
33687. divided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for
33688. his sake and only met because he was there. To the one camp belonged
33689. the old prince, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other
33690. Princess Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and
33691. maids.
33692. 
33693. During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they
33694. were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose
33695. sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all
33696. feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he
33697. was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb
33698. and retired to his apartments directly after dinner. In the evening,
33699. when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to
33700. tell him of the young Count Kamensky's campaign, the old prince
33701. began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her
33702. superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said,
33703. was the only person really attached to him.
33704. 
33705. The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess
33706. Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by
33707. indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The
33708. old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her
33709. life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting
33710. her and that she deserved it. "Why does Prince Andrew, who sees this,
33711. say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an
33712. old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance
33713. and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesn't understand, so I
33714. must explain it, and he must hear me out," thought the old prince.
33715. And he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughter's
33716. unreasonable character.
33717. 
33718. "If you ask me," said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was
33719. censuring his father for the first time in his life), "I did not wish to
33720. speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If
33721. there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I can't
33722. blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and respects you. Since
33723. you ask me," continued Prince Andrew, becoming irritable--as he was
33724. always liable to do of late--"I can only say that if there are any
33725. misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman, who is not
33726. fit to be my sister's companion."
33727. 
33728. The old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural smile
33729. disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew could
33730. not get accustomed.
33731. 
33732. "What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You've already been talking it over!
33733. Eh?"
33734. 
33735. "Father, I did not want to judge," said Prince Andrew, in a hard and
33736. bitter tone, "but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall
33737. say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame--the one to blame--is
33738. that Frenchwoman."
33739. 
33740. "Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!" said the old man in a
33741. low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment,
33742. but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: "Be off, be off! Let not a
33743. trace of you remain here!..."
33744. 
33745. 
33746. Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him
33747. to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not
33748. leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and
33749. Tikhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next day,
33750. before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son's rooms. The boy,
33751. curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,
33752. and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell
33753. into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this
33754. pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He
33755. sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret
33756. at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him,
33757. and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more to him was that
33758. he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son
33759. which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on
33760. his knee.
33761. 
33762. "Well, go on!" said his son.
33763. 
33764. Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out
33765. of the room.
33766. 
33767. As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and
33768. especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had
33769. been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity,
33770. and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as
33771. soon as possible.
33772. 
33773. "So you've decided to go, Andrew?" asked his sister.
33774. 
33775. "Thank God that I can," replied Prince Andrew. "I am very sorry you
33776. can't."
33777. 
33778. "Why do you say that?" replied Princess Mary. "Why do you say that,
33779. when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle
33780. Bourienne says he has been asking about you...."
33781. 
33782. As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears
33783. began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.
33784. 
33785. "Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what--what trash--can cause
33786. people misery!" he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary.
33787. 
33788. She understood that when speaking of "trash" he referred not only to
33789. Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who
33790. had ruined his own happiness.
33791. 
33792. "Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!" she said, touching his
33793. elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. "I
33794. understand you" (she looked down). "Don't imagine that sorrow is the
33795. work of men. Men are His tools." She looked a little above Prince
33796. Andrew's head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks
33797. at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. "Sorrow is sent by Him,
33798. not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to blame. If you think
33799. someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We have no right to
33800. punish. And then you will know the happiness of forgiving."
33801. 
33802. "If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman's virtue. But
33803. a man should not and cannot forgive and forget," he replied, and though
33804. till that moment he had not been thinking of Kuragin, all his unexpended
33805. anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.
33806. 
33807. "If Mary is already persuading me forgive, it means that I ought long
33808. ago to have punished him," he thought. And giving her no further reply,
33809. he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet
33810. Kuragin who he knew was now in the army.
33811. 
33812. Princess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how
33813. unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to
33814. him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again
33815. from the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the
33816. longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.
33817. 
33818. "Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men are
33819. never to blame," were the last words he heard from his sister when he
33820. took leave of her.
33821. 
33822. "Then it must be so!" thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the
33823. avenue from the house at Bald Hills. "She, poor innocent creature, is
33824. left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old
33825. man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up
33826. and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be
33827. deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself don't know. I want
33828. to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and
33829. laugh at me!"
33830. 
33831. These conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were
33832. all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless
33833. things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to
33834. Prince Andrew's mind.
33835. 
33836. 
33837. 
33838. 
33839. 
33840. CHAPTER IX
33841. 
33842. 
33843. Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of
33844. June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified
33845. camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a
33846. junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by
33847. large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course
33848. of affairs in the Russian army, but no one anticipated any danger of
33849. invasion of the Russian provinces, and no one thought the war would
33850. extend farther than the western, the Polish, provinces.
33851. 
33852. Prince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on
33853. the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large
33854. village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and
33855. courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the
33856. villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay
33857. de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received
33858. Bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he
33859. would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment,
33860. but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole Kuragin, whom
33861. Prince Andrew had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had
33862. gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind
33863. was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting
33864. a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the
33865. distraction caused by the thought of Kuragin. During the first four
33866. days, while no duties were required of him, Prince Andrew rode round the
33867. whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own knowledge and by
33868. talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion about it. But the
33869. question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained
33870. for him undecided. Already from his military experience and what he had
33871. seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in
33872. war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all
33873. depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy--that cannot be
33874. foreseen--are met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled.
33875. To clear up this last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his
33876. position and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control
33877. of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced for
33878. himself the following of the state of affairs.
33879. 
33880. While the Emperor had still been at Vilna, the forces had been divided
33881. into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the
33882. army under Bagration, and thirdly, the one commanded by Tormasov. The
33883. Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the
33884. orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command,
33885. but only that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had
33886. with him not a commander in chief's staff but the imperial headquarters
33887. staff. In attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff,
33888. Quartermaster General Prince Volkonski, as well as generals, imperial
33889. aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners,
33890. but not the army staff. Besides these, there were in attendance on the
33891. Emperor without any definite appointments: Arakcheev, the ex-Minister
33892. of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general in rank; the Grand Duke
33893. Tsarevich Constantine Pavlovich; Count Rumyantsev, the Chancellor;
33894. Stein, a former Prussian minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel,
33895. the chief author of the plan of campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general
33896. and Sardinian emigre; Wolzogen--and many others. Though these men had
33897. no military appointment in the army, their position gave them influence,
33898. and often a corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not
33899. know in what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke,
33900. Arakcheev, or Prince Volkonski, or was given this or that advice and did
33901. not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated
33902. from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it had to be
33903. executed or not. But this was only the external condition; the essential
33904. significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people,
33905. from a courtier's point of view (and in an Emperor's vicinity all became
33906. courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the Emperor did not
33907. assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies;
33908. the men around him were his assistants. Arakcheev was a faithful
33909. custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign's bodyguard.
33910. Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vilna province who appeared to be doing
33911. the honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful
33912. as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke
33913. was there because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there
33914. because his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high
33915. esteem personally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general
33916. full of self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander.
33917. Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The
33918. adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the
33919. Emperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up
33920. the plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to
33921. believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business
33922. of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel's thoughts in
33923. a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, bookish
33924. theorist, self-confident to the point of despising everyone else) was
33925. able to do.
33926. 
33927. Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected
33928. ideas every day--especially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness
33929. characteristic of people employed in a country not their own--there were
33930. many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals
33931. were there.
33932. 
33933. Among the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant,
33934. and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined
33935. subdivisions of tendencies and parties:
33936. 
33937. The first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents--military theorists
33938. who believed in a science of war with immutable laws--laws of oblique
33939. movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded
33940. a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise
33941. laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism,
33942. ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To
33943. this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and
33944. others, chiefly Germans.
33945. 
33946. The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as
33947. always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of
33948. this party were those who had demanded an advance from Vilna into Poland
33949. and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold
33950. action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still
33951. more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagration, Ermolov
33952. (who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a
33953. famous joke of Ermolov's was being circulated, that as a great favor he
33954. had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party,
33955. remembering Suvorov, said that what one had to do was not to reason,
33956. or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of
33957. Russia, and not let the army get discouraged.
33958. 
33959. To the third party--in which the Emperor had most confidence--belonged
33960. the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two.
33961. The members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakcheev
33962. belonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish
33963. to seem to have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war,
33964. particularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him
33965. Bonaparte now), needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific
33966. knowledge and in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time
33967. it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one sided, and
33968. therefore one should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen
33969. to what Pfuel's opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had
33970. to say, and then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention
33971. of the camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel's plan, but on changing the
33972. movements of the other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim
33973. nor the other could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of
33974. this third party.
33975. 
33976. Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the
33977. Tsarevich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where
33978. he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry
33979. uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but
33980. unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid
33981. the general confusion. The men of this party had both the quality
33982. and the defect of frankness in their opinions. They feared Napoleon,
33983. recognized his strength and their own weakness, and frankly said so.
33984. They said: "Nothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this!
33985. We have abandoned Vilna and Vitebsk and shall abandon Drissa. The only
33986. reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible,
33987. before we are turned out of Petersburg."
33988. 
33989. This view was very general in the upper army circles and found support
33990. also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyantsev, who, for other
33991. reasons of state, was in favor of peace.
33992. 
33993. The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de
33994. Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in
33995. chief. "Be he what he may" (they always began like that), "he is an
33996. honest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real power,
33997. for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command, and
33998. he will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our army is well
33999. organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering
34000. any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to
34001. be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his
34002. incapacity already in 1807."
34003. 
34004. The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any
34005. rate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: "and
34006. twist about as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually.
34007. Let the others make mistakes now!" said they, arguing that our
34008. retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series
34009. of blunders. "The more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any
34010. rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this.
34011. What is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen,
34012. who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justice--a
34013. man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the
34014. only such man."
34015. 
34016. The seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to
34017. be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were
34018. particularly many round Alexander--generals and imperial aides-de-camp
34019. passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a monarch but as a
34020. man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as Rostov had done
34021. in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human
34022. capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with the sovereign
34023. for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for such excessive
34024. modesty, and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign
34025. should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place
34026. himself at the head of the army, gather round him a commander in chief's
34027. staff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where
34028. necessary, would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be
34029. raised to the highest pitch.
34030. 
34031. The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the
34032. others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither
34033. peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa
34034. or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor
34035. Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thing--as much advantage
34036. and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of
34037. conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor's
34038. headquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at
34039. other times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would
34040. today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the day after,
34041. merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare
34042. that he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who wished to
34043. gain some advantage would attract the Emperor's attention by loudly
34044. advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day before,
34045. and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast and
34046. challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby proving
34047. that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good. A third,
34048. in the absence of opponents, between two councils would simply solicit
34049. a special gratuity for his faithful services, well knowing that at that
34050. moment people would be too busy to refuse him. A fourth while seemingly
34051. overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the Emperor's
34052. eye. A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the
34053. Emperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some
34054. newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more
34055. or less forcible and correct.
34056. 
34057. All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and
34058. promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial
34059. favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole
34060. drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it
34061. was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the
34062. uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving
34063. a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of
34064. intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity
34065. of race among these people--this eighth and largest party of those
34066. preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and
34067. obscurity to the common task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these
34068. drones, without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew
34069. over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of
34070. those who were disputing honestly.
34071. 
34072. From among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached
34073. the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning
34074. to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men
34075. experienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of
34076. those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of what
34077. was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of
34078. escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.
34079. 
34080. The men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted
34081. chiefly from the Emperor's presence in the army with his military court
34082. and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional,
34083. and unsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but
34084. harmful in an army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the
34085. army, and that the only way out of the position would be for the Emperor
34086. and his court to leave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor
34087. paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his
34088. personal safety, and that the worst commander in chief if independent
34089. would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and
34090. authority of the monarch.
34091. 
34092. Just at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,
34093. Shishkov, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of
34094. this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakcheev and Balashev
34095. agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission given him
34096. by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully
34097. suggested--on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse
34098. a warlike spirit in the people of the capital--that the Emperor should
34099. leave the army.
34100. 
34101. That arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to
34102. defend their country--the very incitement which was the chief cause of
34103. Russia's triumph in so far as it was produced by the Tsar's personal
34104. presence in Moscow--was suggested to the Emperor, and accepted by him,
34105. as a pretext for quitting the army.
34106. 
34107. 
34108. 
34109. 
34110. 
34111. CHAPTER X
34112. 
34113. 
34114. This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one
34115. day at dinner, informed Bolkonski that the sovereign wished to see him
34116. personally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to
34117. present himself at Bennigsen's quarters at six that evening.
34118. 
34119. News was received at the Emperor's quarters that very day of a fresh
34120. movement by Napoleon which might endanger the army--news subsequently
34121. found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the
34122. Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out to him that
34123. this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel, and till then considered
34124. a chef-d'oeuvre of tactical science which would ensure Napoleon's
34125. destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the
34126. Russian army.
34127. 
34128. Prince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen's quarters--a country gentleman's
34129. house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. Neither
34130. Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernyshev, the Emperor's
34131. aide-de-camp, received Bolkonski and informed him that the Emperor,
34132. accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second
34133. time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the
34134. suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.
34135. 
34136. Chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel
34137. in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was still
34138. an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one corner stood
34139. the folding bedstead of Bennigsen's adjutant. This adjutant was also
34140. there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by
34141. work or by feasting. Two doors led from the room, one straight on into
34142. what had been the drawing room, and another, on the right, to the study.
34143. Through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in German
34144. and occasionally in French. In that drawing room were gathered, by
34145. the Emperor's wish, not a military council (the Emperor preferred
34146. indefiniteness), but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in
34147. view of the impending difficulties. It was not a council of war, but,
34148. as it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor
34149. personally. To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General
34150. Armfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had
34151. referred to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein
34152. who was not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince
34153. Andrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew
34154. had an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon
34155. after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a
34156. minute to speak to Chernyshev.
34157. 
34158. At first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general,
34159. which fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince
34160. Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about
34161. him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German
34162. theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more
34163. typical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German
34164. theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to
34165. such an extent.
34166. 
34167. Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build,
34168. broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face was
34169. much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been hastily
34170. brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in quaint
34171. little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and angrily
34172. around, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment. Awkwardly
34173. holding up his sword, he addressed Chernyshev and asked in German where
34174. the Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass through the rooms
34175. as quickly as possible, finish with the bows and greetings, and sit down
34176. to business in front of a map, where he would feel at home. He nodded
34177. hurriedly in reply to Chernyshev, and smiled ironically on hearing that
34178. the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had
34179. planned in accord with his theory. He muttered something to himself
34180. abruptly and in a bass voice, as self-assured Germans do--it might
34181. have been "stupid fellow"... or "the whole affair will be ruined," or
34182. "something absurd will come of it."... Prince Andrew did not catch
34183. what he said and would have passed on, but Chernyshev introduced him to
34184. Pfuel, remarking that Prince Andrew was just back from Turkey where the
34185. war had terminated so fortunately. Pfuel barely glanced--not so much at
34186. Prince Andrew as past him--and said, with a laugh: "That must have been
34187. a fine tactical war"; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the
34188. room from which the sound of voices was heard.
34189. 
34190. Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly
34191. disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect
34192. and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with
34193. Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to
34194. form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly
34195. and immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of
34196. martyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident
34197. on the basis of an abstract notion--science, that is, the supposed
34198. knowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he
34199. regards himself personally, both in mind and body, as irresistibly
34200. attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured, as being a
34201. citizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an
34202. Englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as
34203. an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because
34204. he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian
34205. is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know
34206. anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The
34207. German's self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more
34208. repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the
34209. truth--science--which he himself has invented but which is for him the
34210. absolute truth.
34211. 
34212. Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science--the theory of
34213. oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the
34214. Great's wars, and all he came across in the history of more recent
34215. warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous--monstrous collisions in
34216. which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars
34217. could not be called wars, they did not accord with the theory, and
34218. therefore could not serve as material for science.
34219. 
34220. In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of
34221. campaign that ended in Jena and Auerstadt, but he did not see the least
34222. proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On
34223. the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion,
34224. the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically
34225. gleeful sarcasm he would remark, "There, I said the whole affair would
34226. go to the devil!" Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love
34227. their theory that they lose sight of the theory's object--its practical
34228. application. His love of theory made him hate everything practical, and
34229. he would not listen to it. He was even pleased by failures, for failures
34230. resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him
34231. the accuracy of his theory.
34232. 
34233. He said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernyshev about the present
34234. war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong,
34235. and who is not displeased that it should be so. The unbrushed tufts
34236. of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples
34237. expressed this most eloquently.
34238. 
34239. He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his
34240. voice were at once heard from there.
34241. 
34242. 
34243. 
34244. 
34245. 
34246. CHAPTER XI
34247. 
34248. 
34249. Prince Andrew's eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when
34250. Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolkonski, but not
34251. pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he
34252. went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on
34253. to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign.
34254. Chernyshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor,
34255. who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to
34256. him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the
34257. left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward
34258. evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited
34259. Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.
34260. 
34261. "And as for the man who advised forming this camp--the Drissa camp,"
34262. said Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince
34263. Andrew scanned his unfamiliar face, "as to that person, sire..."
34264. continued Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself,
34265. "the man who advised the Drissa camp--I see no alternative but the
34266. lunatic asylum or the gallows!"
34267. 
34268. Without heeding the end of the Italian's remarks, and as though
34269. not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkonski, addressed him
34270. graciously.
34271. 
34272. "I am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting, and wait
34273. for me."
34274. 
34275. The Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter
34276. Mikhaylovich Volkonski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind them.
34277. Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor's permission, accompanied
34278. Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the
34279. council was assembled.
34280. 
34281. Prince Peter Mikhaylovich Volkonski occupied the position, as it were,
34282. of chief of the Emperor's staff. He came out of the study into the
34283. drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put
34284. questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen
34285. present. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to be
34286. false) had been received during the night of a movement by the French to
34287. outflank the Drissa camp.
34288. 
34289. The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that
34290. presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position
34291. away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was
34292. inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an
34293. opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and
34294. there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that
34295. plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions
34296. put--which, in fact, his plan did not answer--as to avail himself of the
34297. opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as
34298. good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown
34299. what character the war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others
34300. defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish general's views
34301. more warmly than anyone else, and in the course of the dispute drew from
34302. his side pocket a well-filled notebook, which he asked permission to
34303. read to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme,
34304. totally different from Armfeldt's or Pfuel's plan of campaign. In answer
34305. to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged,
34306. could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap
34307. (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.
34308. 
34309. During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen
34310. (his "bridge" in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted
34311. contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean
34312. himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when
34313. Prince Volkonski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his
34314. opinion, he merely said:
34315. 
34316. "Why ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an
34317. exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman's attack--very fine, or
34318. a retreat, also good! Why ask me?" said he. "Why, you yourselves know
34319. everything better than I do."
34320. 
34321. But when Volkonski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperor's name
34322. that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated,
34323. began to speak:
34324. 
34325. "Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought they
34326. knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There
34327. is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly
34328. adhered to," said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. "What
34329. is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!"
34330. 
34331. He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no
34332. eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that
34333. everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to
34334. outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.
34335. 
34336. Paulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French.
34337. Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly,
34338. and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who
34339. was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all
34340. that could happen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there
34341. were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan
34342. had not been precisely executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he
34343. demonstrated, and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like
34344. a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of
34345. a problem that has already been proved. Wolzogen took his place and
34346. continued to explain his views in French, every now and then turning to
34347. Pfuel and saying, "Is it not so, your excellency?" But Pfuel, like a man
34348. heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at
34349. his own supporter, Wolzogen:
34350. 
34351. "Well, of course, what more is there to explain?"
34352. 
34353. Paulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French.
34354. Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to Volkonski in
34355. Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.
34356. 
34357. Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,
34358. determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present,
34359. evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no
34360. hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a
34361. theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was
34362. ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary
34363. respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks
34364. of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable
34365. at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon's
34366. genius, which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder.
34367. Everything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him
34368. from every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other's
34369. proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like
34370. everyone else who opposed his theory. But besides this feeling of
34371. respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew. From the tone in which
34372. the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to
34373. speak of him to the Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation
34374. in Pfuel's own expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel
34375. himself felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence
34376. and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly
34377. brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he
34378. concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was
34379. evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his
34380. theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world
34381. was slipping away from him.
34382. 
34383. The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted
34384. the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and
34385. personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general
34386. conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this
34387. polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and shouts,
34388. felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought that had
34389. long since and often occurred to him during his military activities--the
34390. idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that
34391. therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius--now appeared
34392. to him an obvious truth. "What theory and science is possible about a
34393. matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot
34394. be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be
34395. ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or
34396. the enemy's armies will be in a day's time, and no one can gauge the
34397. force of this or that detachment. Sometimes--when there is not a coward
34398. at the front to shout, 'We are cut off!' and start running, but a brave
34399. and jolly lad who shouts, 'Hurrah!'--a detachment of five thousand
34400. is worth thirty thousand, as at Schon Grabern, while at times fifty
34401. thousand run from eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can
34402. there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing
34403. can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the
34404. significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives
34405. no one knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci
34406. says we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that
34407. the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it,
34408. and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes
34409. one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the
34410. advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial.
34411. And why do they all speak of a 'military genius'? Is a man a genius who
34412. can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go
34413. to the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are
34414. invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power,
34415. attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best
34416. generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded
34417. men. Bagration was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of
34418. Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the
34419. field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any
34420. special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest
34421. and best human attributes--love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic
34422. inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he
34423. is doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient
34424. patience), and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he
34425. should be humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just
34426. and unjust. It is understandable that a theory of their 'genius' was
34427. invented for them long ago because they have power! The success of a
34428. military action depends not on them, but on the man in the ranks who
34429. shouts, 'We are lost!' or who shouts, 'Hurrah!' And only in the ranks
34430. can one serve with assurance of being useful."
34431. 
34432. So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he roused
34433. himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.
34434. 
34435. At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would
34436. like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles
34437. forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign's person, but
34438. for permission to serve in the army.
34439. 
34440. 
34441. 
34442. 
34443. 
34444. CHAPTER XII
34445. 
34446. 
34447. Before the beginning of the campaign, Rostov had received a letter from
34448. his parents in which they told him briefly of Natasha's illness and the
34449. breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by
34450. Natasha's having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from
34451. the army and return home. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did not
34452. even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the
34453. army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry Natasha was ill and her
34454. engagement broken off, and that he would do all he could to meet their
34455. wishes. To Sonya he wrote separately.
34456. 
34457. "Adored friend of my soul!" he wrote. "Nothing but honor could keep
34458. me from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of the
34459. campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades' eyes but
34460. in my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the
34461. Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly
34462. the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will
34463. throw up everything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent
34464. breast."
34465. 
34466. It was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented
34467. Rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying Sonya. The
34468. autumn in Otradnoe with the hunting, and the winter with the Christmas
34469. holidays and Sonya's love, had opened out to him a vista of tranquil
34470. rural joys and peace such as he had never known before, and which now
34471. allured him. "A splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a
34472. dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by
34473. election..." thought he. But now the campaign was beginning, and he had
34474. to remain with his regiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas Rostov,
34475. as was natural to him, felt contented with the life he led in the
34476. regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life.
34477. 
34478. On his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully welcomed
34479. by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the
34480. Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation
34481. from his commanders. During his absence he had been promoted captain,
34482. and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in
34483. numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.
34484. 
34485. The campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay,
34486. new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody was
34487. infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement
34488. of a war, and Rostov, conscious of his advantageous position in the
34489. regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of
34490. military service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to
34491. relinquish them.
34492. 
34493. The troops retired from Vilna for various complicated reasons of state,
34494. political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was accompanied by
34495. a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and passions at
34496. headquarters. For the Pavlograd hussars, however, the whole of this
34497. retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies
34498. was a very simple and agreeable business.
34499. 
34500. It was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, and
34501. intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where
34502. they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, it was only
34503. because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some
34504. pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things looked bad chanced
34505. to enter anyone's head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good
34506. soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs, but only of
34507. the task nearest to hand. First they camped gaily before Vilna, making
34508. acquaintance with the Polish landowners, preparing for reviews and being
34509. reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders. Then came an order
34510. to retreat to Sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry
34511. away with them. Sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the
34512. drunken camp, a name the whole army gave to their encampment there,
34513. and because many complaints were made against the troops, who, taking
34514. advantage of the order to collect provisions, took also horses,
34515. carriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors. Rostov remembered
34516. Sventsyani, because on the first day of their arrival at that small town
34517. he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken
34518. men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels
34519. of old beer. From Sventsyani they retired farther and farther to Drissa,
34520. and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier of Russia
34521. proper.
34522. 
34523. On the thirteenth of July the Pavlograds took part in a serious action
34524. for the first time.
34525. 
34526. On the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy
34527. storm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was remarkable
34528. for its storms.
34529. 
34530. The two Pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which
34531. was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and
34532. horses. The rain was descending in torrents, and Rostov, with a young
34533. officer named Ilyin, his protege, was sitting in a hastily constructed
34534. shelter. An officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending
34535. onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the
34536. rain, entered Rostov's shelter.
34537. 
34538. "I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Raevski's
34539. exploit?"
34540. 
34541. And the officer gave them details of the Saltanov battle, which he had
34542. heard at the staff.
34543. 
34544. Rostov, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water
34545. trickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional
34546. glance at Ilyin, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad
34547. of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same
34548. relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denisov seven years
34549. before. Ilyin tried to imitate Rostov in everything and adored him as a
34550. girl might have done.
34551. 
34552. Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of
34553. the Saltanov dam being "a Russian Thermopylae," and of how a deed worthy
34554. of antiquity had been performed by General Raevski. He recounted how
34555. Raevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had
34556. charged with them beside him. Rostov heard the story and not only said
34557. nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski's enthusiasm but, on the contrary,
34558. looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no
34559. intention of contradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and
34560. of 1807 Rostov knew by experience that men always lie when describing
34561. military exploits, as he himself had done when recounting them; besides
34562. that, he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at
34563. all as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski's
34564. tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches
34565. extending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was
34566. his habit, and crowded Rostov in the narrow shanty. Rostov looked at him
34567. in silence. "In the first place, there must have been such a confusion
34568. and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raevski did lead
34569. his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen
34570. men nearest to him," thought he, "the rest could not have seen how or
34571. with whom Raevski came onto the dam. And even those who did see it
34572. would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had they to do with
34573. Raevski's tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger?
34574. And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend on whether
34575. they took the Saltanov dam or not, as we are told was the case at
34576. Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice? And why expose
34577. his own children in the battle? I would not have taken my brother Petya
34578. there, or even Ilyin, who's a stranger to me but a nice lad, but would
34579. have tried to put them somewhere under cover," Nicholas continued
34580. to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his
34581. thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew
34582. that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to
34583. pretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.
34584. 
34585. "I can't stand this any more," said Ilyin, noticing that Rostov did not
34586. relish Zdrzhinski's conversation. "My stockings and shirt... and the
34587. water is running on my seat! I'll go and look for shelter. The rain
34588. seems less heavy."
34589. 
34590. Ilyin went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.
34591. 
34592. Five minutes later Ilyin, splashing through the mud, came running back
34593. to the shanty.
34594. 
34595. "Hurrah! Rostov, come quick! I've found it! About two hundred yards away
34596. there's a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can at least get
34597. dry there, and Mary Hendrikhovna's there."
34598. 
34599. Mary Hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty young
34600. German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether from lack
34601. of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in
34602. the early days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the
34603. hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among
34604. the hussar officers.
34605. 
34606. Rostov threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavrushka to
34607. follow with the things, and--now slipping in the mud, now splashing
34608. right through it--set off with Ilyin in the lessening rain and the
34609. darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.
34610. 
34611. "Rostov, where are you?"
34612. 
34613. "Here. What lightning!" they called to one another.
34614. 
34615. 
34616. 
34617. 
34618. 
34619. CHAPTER XIII
34620. 
34621. 
34622. In the tavern, before which stood the doctor's covered cart, there were
34623. already some five officers. Mary Hendrikhovna, a plump little blonde
34624. German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench
34625. in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her.
34626. Rostov and Ilyin, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts
34627. and laughter.
34628. 
34629. "Dear me, how jolly we are!" said Rostov laughing.
34630. 
34631. "And why do you stand there gaping?"
34632. 
34633. "What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don't make our
34634. drawing room so wet."
34635. 
34636. "Don't mess Mary Hendrikhovna's dress!" cried other voices.
34637. 
34638. Rostov and Ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change into
34639. dry clothes without offending Mary Hendrikhovna's modesty. They were
34640. going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it
34641. completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light
34642. of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no
34643. account yield their position. Mary Hendrikhovna obliged them with the
34644. loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and behind that screen
34645. Rostov and Ilyin, helped by Lavrushka who had brought their kits,
34646. changed their wet things for dry ones.
34647. 
34648. A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was found,
34649. fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was
34650. produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary
34651. Hendrikhovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a
34652. clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket
34653. under her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat
34654. over the window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies
34655. off her husband's face, lest he should wake up.
34656. 
34657. "Leave him alone," said Mary Hendrikhovna, smiling timidly and happily.
34658. "He is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night."
34659. 
34660. "Oh, no, Mary Hendrikhovna," replied the officer, "one must look after
34661. the doctor. Perhaps he'll take pity on me someday, when it comes to
34662. cutting off a leg or an arm for me."
34663. 
34664. There were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could
34665. not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held
34666. only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to
34667. take turns in order of seniority to receive one's tumbler from Mary
34668. Hendrikhovna's plump little hands with their short and not overclean
34669. nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love with
34670. her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon
34671. left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general
34672. mood of courting Mary Hendrikhovna. She, seeing herself surrounded by
34673. such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as
34674. she might to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her
34675. husband moved in his sleep behind her.
34676. 
34677. There was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything
34678. else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary
34679. Hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rostov received
34680. his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary Hendrikhovna to stir
34681. it.
34682. 
34683. "But you take it without sugar?" she said, smiling all the time, as if
34684. everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and
34685. had a double meaning.
34686. 
34687. "It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir
34688. my tea."
34689. 
34690. Mary Hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone
34691. meanwhile had pounced on.
34692. 
34693. "Use your finger, Mary Hendrikhovna, it will be still nicer," said
34694. Rostov.
34695. 
34696. "Too hot!" she replied, blushing with pleasure.
34697. 
34698. Ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to
34699. Mary Hendrikhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.
34700. 
34701. "This is my cup," said he. "Only dip your finger in it and I'll drink it
34702. all up."
34703. 
34704. When they had emptied the samovar, Rostov took a pack of cards and
34705. proposed that they should play "Kings" with Mary Hendrikhovna. They drew
34706. lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rostov's suggestion it
34707. was agreed that whoever became "King" should have the right to kiss Mary
34708. Hendrikhovna's hand, and that the "Booby" should go to refill and reheat
34709. the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.
34710. 
34711. "Well, but supposing Mary Hendrikhovna is 'King'?" asked Ilyin.
34712. 
34713. "As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!"
34714. 
34715. They had hardly begun to play before the doctor's disheveled head
34716. suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendrikhovna. He had been awake for
34717. some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found nothing
34718. entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and
34719. depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked
34720. to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he
34721. had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary
34722. Hendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became
34723. still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor
34724. told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in
34725. alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go
34726. to sleep in their covered cart, or everything in it would be stolen.
34727. 
34728. "But I'll send an orderly.... Two of them!" said Rostov. "What an idea,
34729. doctor!"
34730. 
34731. "I'll stand guard on it myself!" said Ilyin.
34732. 
34733. "No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two
34734. nights," replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife,
34735. waiting for the game to end.
34736. 
34737. Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew
34738. still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for
34739. which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking
34740. his wife with him, and had settled down with her in their covered cart,
34741. the officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their
34742. wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged
34743. remarks, recalling the doctor's uneasiness and his wife's delight, now
34744. they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the
34745. covered trap. Several times Rostov, covering his head, tried to go
34746. to sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be
34747. resumed, to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.
34748. 
34749. 
34750. 
34751. 
34752. 
34753. CHAPTER XIV
34754. 
34755. 
34756. It was nearly three o'clock but no one was yet asleep, when the
34757. quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town
34758. of Ostrovna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly
34759. getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But
34760. Rostov went off to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was
34761. breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt
34762. damp and cold, especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left
34763. the tavern in the twilight of the dawn, Rostov and Ilyin both glanced
34764. under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctor's cart, from
34765. under the apron of which his feet were sticking out, and in the middle
34766. of which his wife's nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing
34767. audible.
34768. 
34769. "She really is a dear little thing," said Rostov to Ilyin, who was
34770. following him.
34771. 
34772. "A charming woman!" said Ilyin, with all the gravity of a boy of
34773. sixteen.
34774. 
34775. Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command
34776. was heard to "mount" and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted.
34777. Rostov riding in front gave the order "Forward!" and the hussars, with
34778. clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses' hoofs splashing in the
34779. mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch
34780. trees on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone
34781. on in front.
34782. 
34783. Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding
34784. before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass
34785. which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still
34786. wet with the night's rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also
34787. wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one
34788. side. The soldiers' faces were more and more clearly visible. Rostov,
34789. always closely followed by Ilyin, rode along the side of the road
34790. between two rows of birch trees.
34791. 
34792. When campaigning, Rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding not
34793. a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman,
34794. he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Donets horse,
34795. dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could
34796. outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought
34797. of the horse, of the morning, of the doctor's wife, but not once of the
34798. impending danger.
34799. 
34800. Formerly, when going into action, Rostov had felt afraid; now he had
34801. not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown
34802. used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because
34803. he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown
34804. accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would
34805. seem most likely to interest him--the impending danger. During the
34806. first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached
34807. himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time
34808. it had come of itself. Now he rode beside Ilyin under the birch trees,
34809. occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes
34810. touching his horse's side with his foot, or, without turning round,
34811. handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him, with as
34812. calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride. He
34813. glanced with pity at the excited face of Ilyin, who talked much and in
34814. great agitation. He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of
34815. terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could
34816. help him.
34817. 
34818. As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds,
34819. the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning
34820. after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and
34821. all was still. The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared
34822. behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it
34823. reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its
34824. edge. Everything grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as
34825. if in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.
34826. 
34827. Before Rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of
34828. that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy's adjutant came galloping from
34829. Vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.
34830. 
34831. The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery--which
34832. had also quickened their pace--rode down a hill, and passing through an
34833. empty and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to lather
34834. and the men to flush.
34835. 
34836. "Halt! Dress your ranks!" the order of the regimental commander was
34837. heard ahead. "Forward by the left. Walk, march!" came the order from in
34838. front.
34839. 
34840. And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of
34841. our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To
34842. the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve.
34843. Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through
34844. the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning
34845. sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemy's
34846. columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard
34847. briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.
34848. 
34849. At these sounds, long unheard, Rostov's spirits rose, as at the strains
34850. of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together,
34851. now several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then
34852. again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding
34853. them.
34854. 
34855. The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade
34856. began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron,
34857. halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to
34858. the guns.
34859. 
34860. After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.
34861. 
34862. "Form column! Prepare to charge!"
34863. 
34864. The infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry
34865. to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears fluttering,
34866. and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was seen below to
34867. the left.
34868. 
34869. As soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up
34870. the hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by the
34871. Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but fell
34872. spent without taking effect.
34873. 
34874. The sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more
34875. pleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rostov than the previous sounds
34876. of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out
34877. before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement
34878. of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French dragoons, something
34879. confused happened there amid the smoke, and five minutes later our
34880. Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they had occupied but more
34881. to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and
34882. behind them, in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could
34883. be seen.
34884. 
34885. 
34886. 
34887. 
34888. 
34889. CHAPTER XV
34890. 
34891. 
34892. Rostov, with his keen sportsman's eye, was one of the first to catch
34893. sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and
34894. nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons
34895. pursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small
34896. at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their
34897. arms and their sabers in the air.
34898. 
34899. Rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He felt
34900. instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the
34901. latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be made it must
34902. be done now, at that very moment, or it would be too late. He looked
34903. around. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing like himself with
34904. eyes fixed on the cavalry below them.
34905. 
34906. "Andrew Sevastyanych!" said Rostov. "You know, we could crush them...."
34907. 
34908. "A fine thing too!" replied the captain, "and really..."
34909. 
34910. Rostov, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to
34911. the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the
34912. word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following
34913. him. Rostov himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he
34914. did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He saw the dragoons
34915. near and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not
34916. withstand an attack--knew there was only that moment and that if he let
34917. it slip it would not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so
34918. stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could
34919. not restrain himself. He touched his horse, gave the word of command,
34920. and immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his
34921. deployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons.
34922. Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace
34923. instinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they
34924. drew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after
34925. them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the
34926. foremost began to turn, while those behind began to halt. With the same
34927. feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rostov
34928. gave rein to his Donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the
34929. dragoons' disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot
34930. flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless
34931. horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were
34932. galloping back. Rostov, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after
34933. him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and
34934. almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would
34935. immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his
34936. uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse
34937. and urging it on with his saber. In another moment Rostov's horse dashed
34938. its breast against the hindquarters of the officer's horse, almost
34939. knocking it over, and at the same instant Rostov, without knowing why,
34940. raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.
34941. 
34942. The instant he had done this, all Rostov's animation vanished. The
34943. officer fell, not so much from the blow--which had but slightly cut his
34944. arm above the elbow--as from the shock to his horse and from fright.
34945. Rostov reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he
34946. had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on
34947. the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed
34948. up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at
34949. Rostov with shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained face--fair and
34950. young, with a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyes--was not an enemy's
34951. face at all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face.
34952. Before Rostov had decided what to do with him, the officer cried, "I
34953. surrender!" He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the
34954. stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostov's face.
34955. Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the
34956. saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was
34957. wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his
34958. horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him;
34959. a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In front, the
34960. French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily
34961. back with their prisoners. Rostov galloped back with the rest, aware of
34962. an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague and
34963. confused, which he could not at all account for, had come over him with
34964. the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him.
34965. 
34966. Count Ostermann-Tolstoy met the returning hussars, sent for Rostov,
34967. thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor
34968. and would recommend him for a St. George's Cross. When sent for by Count
34969. Ostermann, Rostov, remembering that he had charged without orders,
34970. felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of
34971. discipline. Ostermann's flattering words and promise of a reward should
34972. therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt
34973. that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. "But what
34974. on earth is worrying me?" he asked himself as he rode back from the
34975. general. "Ilyin? No, he's safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No,
34976. that's not it." Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. "Yes,
34977. oh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm
34978. paused when I raised it."
34979. 
34980. Rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have
34981. a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was sitting in
34982. his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about
34983. him; The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound. He
34984. glanced at Rostov with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting.
34985. Rostov still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.
34986. 
34987. All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that Rostov,
34988. without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied.
34989. He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept turning something
34990. over in his mind.
34991. 
34992. Rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to
34993. his amazement had gained him the St. George's Cross and even given him
34994. a reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at all
34995. understand. "So others are even more afraid than I am!" he thought. "So
34996. that's all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my
34997. country's sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes?
34998. And how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should
34999. I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. George's
35000. Cross.... I can't make it out at all."
35001. 
35002. But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach
35003. no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the
35004. service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the affair at
35005. Ostrovna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar
35006. battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen.
35007. 
35008. 
35009. 
35010. 
35011. 
35012. CHAPTER XVI
35013. 
35014. 
35015. On receiving news of Natasha's illness, the countess, though not quite
35016. well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with Petya and the rest of the
35017. household, and the whole family moved from Marya Dmitrievna's house to
35018. their own and settled down in town.
35019. 
35020. Natasha's illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for
35021. her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness,
35022. her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the
35023. background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider
35024. in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat
35025. or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them
35026. feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help
35027. her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in
35028. French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great
35029. variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple
35030. idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease
35031. Natasha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be
35032. known, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always
35033. has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to
35034. medicine--not a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and
35035. so on mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the
35036. innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs. This simple
35037. thought could not occur to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard
35038. that he is unable to work his charms) because the business of their
35039. lives was to cure, and they received money for it and had spent the best
35040. years of their lives on that business. But, above all, that thought
35041. was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were
35042. really useful, as in fact they were to the whole Rostov family. Their
35043. usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for
35044. the most part harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they
35045. were given in small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and
35046. indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and
35047. of those who loved her--and that is why there are, and always will be,
35048. pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They satisfied
35049. that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that
35050. something should be done, which is felt by those who are suffering. They
35051. satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child, when it
35052. wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A child knocks itself
35053. and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching
35054. spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done. The child
35055. cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no
35056. remedy for its pain, and the hope of relief and the expression of its
35057. mother's sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it. The doctors were
35058. of use to Natasha because they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her
35059. that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemist's in
35060. the Arbat and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble
35061. and seventy kopeks, and if she took those powders in boiled water at
35062. intervals of precisely two hours, neither more nor less.
35063. 
35064. What would Sonya and the count and countess have done, how would they
35065. have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pills
35066. to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all the
35067. other details of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of which
35068. supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle? How would
35069. the count have borne his dearly loved daughter's illness had he not
35070. known that it was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would not
35071. grudge thousands more to benefit her, or had he not known that if her
35072. illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take
35073. her abroad for consultations there, and had he not been able to explain
35074. the details of how Metivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms,
35075. but Frise had, and Mudrov had diagnosed them even better? What would the
35076. countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid
35077. for not strictly obeying the doctor's orders?
35078. 
35079. "You'll never get well like that," she would say, forgetting her grief
35080. in her vexation, "if you won't obey the doctor and take your medicine at
35081. the right time! You mustn't trifle with it, you know, or it may turn to
35082. pneumonia," she would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance of
35083. that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself.
35084. 
35085. What would Sonya have done without the glad consciousness that she had
35086. not undressed during the first three nights, in order to be ready to
35087. carry out all the doctor's injunctions with precision, and that she
35088. still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the
35089. slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered?
35090. Even to Natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices
35091. were being made for her sake, and to know that she had to take medicine
35092. at certain hours, though she declared that no medicine would cure her
35093. and that it was all nonsense. And it was even pleasant to be able to
35094. show, by disregarding the orders, that she did not believe in medical
35095. treatment and did not value her life.
35096. 
35097. The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and
35098. regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he had
35099. gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed him, he
35100. assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though
35101. there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and
35102. one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly mental, but... And
35103. the countess, trying to conceal the action from herself and from him,
35104. slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient
35105. with a more tranquil mind.
35106. 
35107. The symptoms of Natasha's illness were that she ate little, slept
35108. little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that
35109. she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the
35110. stifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rostovs did not move to the
35111. country that summer of 1812.
35112. 
35113. In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out
35114. of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of
35115. such things made a large collection, and in spite of being deprived of
35116. the country life to which she was accustomed, youth prevailed. Natasha's
35117. grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life, it ceased
35118. to press so painfully on her heart, it gradually faded into the past,
35119. and she began to recover physically.
35120. 
35121. 
35122. 
35123. 
35124. 
35125. CHAPTER XVII
35126. 
35127. 
35128. Natasha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external
35129. forms of pleasure--balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters--but she
35130. never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not
35131. sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears
35132. choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure
35133. times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so
35134. uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy.
35135. Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy,
35136. in face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint, no wish to
35137. coquet ever entered her head. She said and felt at that time that no
35138. man was more to her than Nastasya Ivanovna, the buffoon. Something stood
35139. sentinel within her and forbade her every joy. Besides, she had lost all
35140. the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full
35141. of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, "Uncle," and the Christmas
35142. holidays spent with Nicholas at Otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest
35143. and most painfully. What would she not have given to bring back even a
35144. single day of that time! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at
35145. the time had not deceived her--that that state of freedom and readiness
35146. for any enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live
35147. on.
35148. 
35149. It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly
35150. imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But
35151. this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, "What next?"
35152. But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was
35153. passing. Natasha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to
35154. anyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in
35155. the house and felt at ease only with her brother Petya. She liked to
35156. be with him better than with the others, and when alone with him she
35157. sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left the house and of those who came
35158. to see them was glad to see only one person, Pierre. It would have been
35159. impossible to treat her with more delicacy, greater care, and at the
35160. same time more seriously than did Count Bezukhov. Natasha unconsciously
35161. felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society. But
35162. she was not even grateful to him for it; nothing good on Pierre's part
35163. seemed to her to be an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind
35164. to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Natasha
35165. noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence,
35166. especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared that
35167. something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her. She
35168. noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness,
35169. which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her.
35170. After those involuntary words--that if he were free he would have asked
35171. on his knees for her hand and her love--uttered at a moment when she was
35172. so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Natasha of his feelings;
35173. and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted
35174. her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort
35175. a crying child. It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because
35176. Natasha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of
35177. which she had experienced with Kuragin that it never entered her head
35178. that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her
35179. part, still less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious,
35180. romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known
35181. several instances.
35182. 
35183. Before the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agrafena Ivanovna Belova, a
35184. country neighbor of the Rostovs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at
35185. the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natasha should fast
35186. and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natasha gladly welcomed the idea.
35187. Despite the doctor's orders that she should not go out early in the
35188. morning, Natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament,
35189. not as they generally prepared for it in the Rostov family by attending
35190. three services in their own house, but as Agrafena Ivanovna did, by
35191. going to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers,
35192. Matins, or Mass.
35193. 
35194. The countess was pleased with Natasha's zeal; after the poor results of
35195. the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer
35196. might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without
35197. fear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to Natasha's wish and
35198. entrusted her to Belova. Agrafena Ivanovna used to come to wake Natasha
35199. at three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was
35200. afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meekly putting on
35201. her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla, Natasha, shivering in the fresh
35202. air, went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn.
35203. By Agrafena Ivanovna's advice Natasha prepared herself not in their
35204. own parish, but at a church where, according to the devout Agrafena
35205. Ivanovna, the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were
35206. never many people in the church; Natasha always stood beside Belova in
35207. the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the
35208. screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of
35209. humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her when
35210. at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin
35211. illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light
35212. falling from the window, she listened to the words of the service which
35213. she tried to follow with understanding. When she understood them her
35214. personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its
35215. own. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to think that
35216. the wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to
35217. understand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit
35218. oneself to God, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments. She
35219. crossed herself, bowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror
35220. at her own vileness, simply asked God to forgive her everything,
35221. everything, to have mercy upon her. The prayers to which she surrendered
35222. herself most of all were those of repentance. On her way home at an
35223. early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men
35224. sweeping the street, and everybody within the houses was still asleep,
35225. Natasha experienced a feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility
35226. of correcting her faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of
35227. happiness.
35228. 
35229. During the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every
35230. day. And the happiness of taking communion, or "communing" as Agrafena
35231. Ivanovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Natasha
35232. so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.
35233. 
35234. But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in
35235. white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for
35236. many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life
35237. that lay before her.
35238. 
35239. The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the
35240. powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.
35241. 
35242. "She must certainly go on taking them morning and evening," said
35243. he, evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. "Only, please be
35244. particular about it.
35245. 
35246. "Be quite easy," he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the gold
35247. coin in his palm. "She will soon be singing and frolicking about. The
35248. last medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has freshened
35249. up very much."
35250. 
35251. The countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at her
35252. nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room.
35253. 
35254. 
35255. 
35256. 
35257. 
35258. CHAPTER XVIII
35259. 
35260. 
35261. At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the war
35262. began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the Emperor to
35263. the people, and of his coming himself from the army to Moscow. And as
35264. up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received,
35265. exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of
35266. Russia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was
35267. in danger, it was said that Smolensk had surrendered, that Napoleon had
35268. an army of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.
35269. 
35270. On the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received
35271. but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the Rostovs', promised
35272. to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto
35273. and appeal, which he would obtain from Count Rostopchin.
35274. 
35275. That Sunday, the Rostovs went to Mass at the Razumovskis' private chapel
35276. as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o'clock, when the Rostovs
35277. got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of
35278. hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves
35279. of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white
35280. trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on
35281. the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that
35282. summer languor, that content and discontent with the present, which
35283. is most strongly felt on a bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow
35284. notabilities, all the Rostovs' acquaintances, were at the Razumovskis'
35285. chapel, for, as if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families
35286. who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that
35287. summer. As Natasha, at her mother's side, passed through the crowd
35288. behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a
35289. young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper.
35290. 
35291. "That's Rostova, the one who..."
35292. 
35293. "She's much thinner, but all the same she's pretty!"
35294. 
35295. She heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kuragin and Bolkonski. But
35296. she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that everyone
35297. who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her. With a
35298. sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself
35299. in a crowd, Natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace
35300. walked--as women can walk--with the more repose and stateliness the
35301. greater the pain and shame in her soul. She knew for certain that she
35302. was pretty, but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to.
35303. On the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late, and
35304. particularly so on this bright, hot summer day in town. "It's Sunday
35305. again--another week past," she thought, recalling that she had been here
35306. the Sunday before, "and always the same life that is no life, and the
35307. same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live. I'm pretty,
35308. I'm young, and I know that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I
35309. know I am good," she thought, "but yet my best years are slipping by
35310. and are no good to anyone." She stood by her mother's side and exchanged
35311. nods with acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies'
35312. dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not
35313. crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she thought
35314. with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others,
35315. and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her own
35316. vileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to
35317. her.
35318. 
35319. A comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that
35320. mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the
35321. souls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed,
35322. the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft mysterious voice
35323. pronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which she herself did not
35324. understand, made Natasha's breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive
35325. feeling agitated her.
35326. 
35327. "Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good
35328. forever, forever!" she pleaded.
35329. 
35330. The deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and,
35331. holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic
35332. and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and
35333. solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer...
35334. 
35335. "In peace let us pray unto the Lord."
35336. 
35337. "As one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united
35338. by brotherly love--let us pray!" thought Natasha.
35339. 
35340. "For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our souls."
35341. 
35342. "For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us," prayed
35343. Natasha.
35344. 
35345. When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and
35346. Denisov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she
35347. remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her
35348. all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love us,
35349. she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and
35350. Sonya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward
35351. them, and feeling all the strength of her love for them. When they
35352. prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of her enemies and
35353. people who hated her, in order to pray for them. She included among her
35354. enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her
35355. father, and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she
35356. remembered Anatole who had done her so much harm--and though he did not
35357. hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy. Only at prayer did
35358. she feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole,
35359. as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and
35360. devotion to God. When they prayed for the Imperial family and the Synod,
35361. she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross, saying to herself
35362. that even if she did not understand, still she could not doubt, and at
35363. any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for it.
35364. 
35365. When he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his
35366. breast and said, "Let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to Christ
35367. the Lord!"
35368. 
35369. "Commit ourselves to God," Natasha inwardly repeated. "Lord God, I
35370. submit myself to Thy will!" she thought. "I want nothing, wish for
35371. nothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take
35372. me!" prayed Natasha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing
35373. herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some
35374. invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself,
35375. from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.
35376. 
35377. The countess looked round several times at her daughter's softened face
35378. and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.
35379. 
35380. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order
35381. Natasha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he
35382. knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors
35383. of the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his purple velvet
35384. biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort.
35385. Everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in
35386. surprise. Then came the prayer just received from the Synod--a prayer
35387. for the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.
35388. 
35389. "Lord God of might, God of our salvation!" began the priest in that
35390. voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the Slav clergy
35391. read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.
35392. 
35393. "Lord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and
35394. blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and
35395. have mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay
35396. waste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are gathered
35397. together to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy
35398. beloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow Thine altars, and to
35399. desecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how long shall the wicked
35400. triumph? How long shall they wield unlawful power?
35401. 
35402. "Lord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might
35403. our most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander Pavlovich; be
35404. mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to his
35405. righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless his
35406. counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom by
35407. Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as Thou
35408. gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over
35409. Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands of those who
35410. have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength
35411. for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us;
35412. confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us, may
35413. they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the
35414. wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight; may
35415. they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the plots they have laid
35416. in secret be turned against them; let them fall before Thy servants'
35417. feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art able to save both
35418. great and small; Thou art God, and man cannot prevail against Thee!
35419. 
35420. "God of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and loving-kindness
35421. which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us, but be gracious to our
35422. unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not
35423. our transgressions and iniquities! Create in us a clean heart and renew
35424. a right spirit within us, strengthen us all in Thy faith, fortify our
35425. hope, inspire us with true love one for another, arm us with unity of
35426. spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and
35427. to our fathers, and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against
35428. the destiny of those Thou hast sanctified.
35429. 
35430. "O Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust, let us
35431. not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token of Thy
35432. blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and
35433. be put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that Thou art
35434. the Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, O Lord,
35435. and grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice
35436. in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath
35437. the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the succor,
35438. and the victory of them that put their trust in Thee, and to Thee be all
35439. glory, to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without
35440. end. Amen."
35441. 
35442. In Natasha's receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her
35443. strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over
35444. Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about
35445. the destruction of "Thy Jerusalem," and she prayed to God with the
35446. tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but without
35447. fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer. She
35448. shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness,
35449. for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation
35450. by love. But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under
35451. foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more
35452. of them that she might pray for them. But neither could she doubt the
35453. righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees. She
35454. felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the
35455. punishment that overtakes men for their sins, and especially of her own
35456. sins, and she prayed to God to forgive them all, and her too, and to
35457. give them all, and her too, peace and happiness. And it seemed to her
35458. that God heard her prayer.
35459. 
35460. 
35461. 
35462. 
35463. 
35464. CHAPTER XIX
35465. 
35466. 
35467. From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostovs' with Natasha's
35468. grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to
35469. be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own
35470. horizon--from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all
35471. earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer presented
35472. itself. That terrible question "Why?" "Wherefore?" which had come to him
35473. amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a
35474. reply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or
35475. himself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of
35476. human baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did
35477. not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so
35478. transient and incomprehensible--but he remembered her as he had last
35479. seen her, and all his doubts vanished--not because she had answered
35480. the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of her
35481. transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual
35482. activity in which no one could be justified or guilty--a realm of
35483. beauty and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness
35484. presented itself to him, he said to himself:
35485. 
35486. "Well, supposing N. N. swindled the country and the Tsar, and the
35487. country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She
35488. smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and
35489. no one will ever know it." And his soul felt calm and peaceful.
35490. 
35491. Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle
35492. and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the Rostovs'
35493. there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and
35494. acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along
35495. irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more disquieting reports came
35496. from the seat of war and Natasha's health began to improve and she
35497. no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity, an
35498. ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not explain, took
35499. possession of him. He felt that the condition he was in could not
35500. continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which would change his
35501. whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that
35502. approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons had revealed to
35503. Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from the
35504. Revelation of St. John.
35505. 
35506. In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:
35507. 
35508. 
35509. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of
35510. the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred
35511. threescore and six.
35512. 
35513. And in the fifth verse of the same chapter:
35514. 
35515. 
35516. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
35517. blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two
35518. months.
35519. 
35520. 
35521. The French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as the
35522. Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the others
35523. tens, will have the following significance:
35524. 
35525.       a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k
35526.       1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
35527.        l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s
35528.       20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90
35529.              t    u    v    w    x    y
35530.             100  110  120  130  140  150
35531.                         z
35532.                        160
35533. 
35534. 
35535. Writing the words L'Empereur Napoleon in numbers, it appears that the
35536. sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold
35537. in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words
35538. quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that "spoke
35539. great things and blasphemies," the same number 666 was obtained; from
35540. which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon's power had come
35541. in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy
35542. pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an
35543. end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the
35544. same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an
35545. answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words L'Empereur
35546. Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums
35547. were either more or less than 666. Once when making such calculations he
35548. wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the
35549. sum of the numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling,
35550. substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le, still
35551. without obtaining the desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the
35552. answer to the question were contained in his name, his nationality would
35553. also be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding
35554. up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much, and five was
35555. represented by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the
35556. word Empereur. By omitting the e, though incorrectly, Pierre got the
35557. answer he sought. L'russe Besuhof made 666. This discovery excited him.
35558. How, or by what means, he was connected with the great event foretold in
35559. the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that connection for
35560. a moment. His love for Natasha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the
35561. comet, 666, L'Empereur Napoleon, and L'russe Besuhof--all this had to
35562. mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere
35563. of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a
35564. great achievement and great happiness.
35565. 
35566. 
35567.     * Forty-two.
35568. 
35569. 
35570. On the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre had
35571. promised the Rostovs to bring them, from Count Rostopchin whom he knew
35572. well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the army. In the
35573. morning, when he went to call at Rostopchin's he met there a courier
35574. fresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at
35575. Moscow balls.
35576. 
35577. "Do, please, for heaven's sake, relieve me of something!" said the
35578. courier. "I have a sackful of letters to parents."
35579. 
35580. Among these letters was one from Nicholas Rostov to his father. Pierre
35581. took that letter, and Rostopchin also gave him the Emperor's appeal to
35582. Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own
35583. most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in
35584. one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of
35585. Nicholas Rostov, awarded a St. George's Cross of the Fourth Class for
35586. courage shown in the Ostrovna affair, and in the same order the name
35587. of Prince Andrew Bolkonski, appointed to the command of a regiment of
35588. Chasseurs. Though he did not want to remind the Rostovs of Bolkonski,
35589. Pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their
35590. son's having received a decoration, so he sent that printed army order
35591. and Nicholas' letter to the Rostovs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin,
35592. and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner.
35593. 
35594. His conversation with Count Rostopchin and the latter's tone of anxious
35595. hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly
35596. things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in
35597. Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised
35598. to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the
35599. Emperor's being expected to arrive next day--all aroused with fresh
35600. force that feeling of agitation and expectation in Pierre which he had
35601. been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially
35602. since the beginning of the war.
35603. 
35604. He had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so
35605. had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society of
35606. Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual
35607. peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that when he
35608. saw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking
35609. patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. But the chief
35610. reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the
35611. vague idea that he was L'russe Besuhof who had the number of the beast,
35612. 666; that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the
35613. power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been
35614. predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought not to undertake
35615. anything, but wait for what was bound to come to pass.
35616. 
35617. 
35618. 
35619. 
35620. 
35621. CHAPTER XX
35622. 
35623. 
35624. A few intimate friends were dining with the Rostovs that day, as usual
35625. on Sundays.
35626. 
35627. Pierre came early so as to find them alone.
35628. 
35629. He had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he
35630. not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried his
35631. bulk with evident ease.
35632. 
35633. He went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman did
35634. not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was
35635. at the Rostovs' he stayed till midnight. The Rostovs' footman rushed
35636. eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and
35637. stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the
35638. anteroom.
35639. 
35640. The first person he saw in the house was Natasha. Even before he saw
35641. her, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing solfa
35642. exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since her
35643. illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him. He
35644. opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had worn at
35645. church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to him when he
35646. opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised
35647. face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.
35648. 
35649. "I want to try to sing again," she said, adding as if by way of excuse,
35650. "it is, at least, something to do."
35651. 
35652. "That's capital!"
35653. 
35654. "How glad I am you've come! I am so happy today," she said, with the old
35655. animation Pierre had not seen in her for along time. "You know Nicholas
35656. has received a St. George's Cross? I am so proud of him."
35657. 
35658. "Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don't want to interrupt you,"
35659. he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.
35660. 
35661. Natasha stopped him.
35662. 
35663. "Count, is it wrong of me to sing?" she said blushing, and fixing her
35664. eyes inquiringly on him.
35665. 
35666. "No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?"
35667. 
35668. "I don't know myself," Natasha answered quickly, "but I should not like
35669. to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You
35670. don't know how important you are to me, how much you've done for me...."
35671. She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. "I
35672. saw in that same army order that he, Bolkonski" (she whispered the name
35673. hastily), "is in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?"--she
35674. was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail
35675. her--"Will he ever forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling
35676. toward me? What do you think? What do you think?"
35677. 
35678. "I think..." Pierre replied, "that he has nothing to forgive.... If I
35679. were in his place..."
35680. 
35681. By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day
35682. when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but
35683. the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her
35684. hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession
35685. of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she did not give him
35686. time to say them.
35687. 
35688. "Yes, you... you..." she said, uttering the word you
35689. rapturously--"that's a different thing. I know no one kinder, more
35690. generous, or better than you; nobody could be! Had you not been
35691. there then, and now too, I don't know what would have become of me,
35692. because..."
35693. 
35694. Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music
35695. before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and
35696. down the room.
35697. 
35698. Just then Petya came running in from the drawing room.
35699. 
35700. Petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and
35701. resembled Natasha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and
35702. his friend Obolenski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.
35703. 
35704. Petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair.
35705. He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the
35706. hussars.
35707. 
35708. Pierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what Petya
35709. was saying.
35710. 
35711. Petya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.
35712. 
35713. "Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirilych, for heaven's sake! You are my
35714. only hope," said Petya.
35715. 
35716. "Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I'll mention it, I'll bring it
35717. all up today."
35718. 
35719. "Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?" asked the old count. "The
35720. countess has been to Mass at the Razumovskis' and heard the new prayer.
35721. She says it's very fine."
35722. 
35723. "Yes, I've got it," said Pierre. "The Emperor is to be here tomorrow...
35724. there's to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are
35725. talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate
35726. you!"
35727. 
35728. "Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?"
35729. 
35730. "We are again retreating. They say we're already near Smolensk," replied
35731. Pierre.
35732. 
35733. "O Lord, O Lord!" exclaimed the count. "Where is the manifesto?"
35734. 
35735. "The Emperor's appeal? Oh yes!"
35736. 
35737. Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find
35738. them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess
35739. who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting
35740. Natasha, who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing
35741. room.
35742. 
35743. "On my word, I don't know what I've done with it," he said.
35744. 
35745. "There he is, always losing everything!" remarked the countess.
35746. 
35747. Natasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and
35748. sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierre's
35749. features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still
35750. searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.
35751. 
35752. "No, really! I'll drive home, I must have left them there. I'll
35753. certainly..."
35754. 
35755. "But you'll be late for dinner."
35756. 
35757. "Oh! And my coachman has gone."
35758. 
35759. But Sonya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, had
35760. found them in Pierre's hat, where he had carefully tucked them under the
35761. lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.
35762. 
35763. "No, after dinner," said the old count, evidently expecting much
35764. enjoyment from that reading.
35765. 
35766. At dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new
35767. chevalier of St. George, Shinshin told them the town news, of the
35768. illness of the old Georgian princess, of Metivier's disappearance from
35769. Moscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchin
35770. and accused of being a French "spyer" (so Count Rostopchin had told the
35771. story), and how Rostopchin let him go and assured the people that he was
35772. "not a spire at all, but only an old German ruin."
35773. 
35774. "People are being arrested..." said the count. "I've told the countess
35775. she should not speak French so much. It's not the time for it now."
35776. 
35777. "And have you heard?" Shinshin asked. "Prince Golitsyn has engaged a
35778. master to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak French in
35779. the streets."
35780. 
35781. "And how about you, Count Peter Kirilych? If they call up the militia,
35782. you too will have to mount a horse," remarked the old count, addressing
35783. Pierre.
35784. 
35785. Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not
35786. to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.
35787. 
35788. "Oh yes, the war," he said. "No! What sort of warrior should I make? And
35789. yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can't make it out. I don't
35790. know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no
35791. one can answer for himself."
35792. 
35793. After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and
35794. with a serious face asked Sonya, who was considered an excellent reader,
35795. to read the appeal.
35796. 
35797. 
35798. "To Moscow, our ancient Capital!
35799. 
35800. "The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He
35801. comes to despoil our beloved country."
35802. 
35803. 
35804. Sonya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count listened
35805. with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.
35806. 
35807. Natasha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father and
35808. now at Pierre.
35809. 
35810. Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The countess
35811. shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression
35812. in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger
35813. threatening her son would not soon be over. Shinshin, with a sarcastic
35814. smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that
35815. gave him the opportunity: Sonya's reading, any remark of the count's, or
35816. even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself.
35817. 
35818. After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes the
35819. Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility,
35820. Sonya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was
35821. being paid to her, read the last words:
35822. 
35823. 
35824. "We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital
35825. and in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the direction
35826. of all our levies, both those now barring the enemy's path and those
35827. freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the ruin he
35828. hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered
35829. from bondage glorify the name of Russia!"
35830. 
35831. 
35832. "Yes, that's it!" cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing
35833. repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he
35834. added, "Let the Emperor but say the word and we'll sacrifice everything
35835. and begrudge nothing."
35836. 
35837. Before Shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the
35838. count's patriotism, Natasha jumped up from her place and ran to her
35839. father.
35840. 
35841. "What a darling our Papa is!" she cried, kissing him, and she again
35842. looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her
35843. with her better spirits.
35844. 
35845. "There! Here's a patriot for you!" said Shinshin.
35846. 
35847. "Not a patriot at all, but simply..." Natasha replied in an injured
35848. tone. "Everything seems funny to you, but this isn't at all a joke...."
35849. 
35850. "A joke indeed!" put in the count. "Let him but say the word and we'll
35851. all go.... We're not Germans!"
35852. 
35853. "But did you notice, it says, 'for consultation'?" said Pierre.
35854. 
35855. "Never mind what it's for...."
35856. 
35857. At this moment, Petya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came up
35858. to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice
35859. that was now deep and now shrill:
35860. 
35861. "Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it's as you please,
35862. but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army, because I
35863. can't... that's all...."
35864. 
35865. The countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and
35866. turned angrily to her husband.
35867. 
35868. "That comes of your talking!" said she.
35869. 
35870. But the count had already recovered from his excitement.
35871. 
35872. "Come, come!" said he. "Here's a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You must
35873. study."
35874. 
35875. "It's not nonsense, Papa. Fedya Obolenski is younger than I, and he's
35876. going too. Besides, all the same I can't study now when..." Petya
35877. stopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words,
35878. "when our Fatherland is in danger."
35879. 
35880. "That'll do, that'll do--nonsense...."
35881. 
35882. "But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything."
35883. 
35884. "Petya! Be quiet, I tell you!" cried the count, with a glance at his
35885. wife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.
35886. 
35887. "And I tell you--Peter Kirilych here will also tell you..."
35888. 
35889. "Nonsense, I tell you. Your mother's milk has hardly dried on your lips
35890. and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you," and the
35891. count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably to reread
35892. them in his study before having a nap.
35893. 
35894. "Well, Peter Kirilych, let's go and have a smoke," he said.
35895. 
35896. Pierre was agitated and undecided. Natasha's unwontedly brilliant eyes,
35897. continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had reduced
35898. him to this condition.
35899. 
35900. "No, I think I'll go home."
35901. 
35902. "Home? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don't
35903. often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine," said the count
35904. good-naturedly, pointing to Natasha, "only brightens up when you're
35905. here."
35906. 
35907. "Yes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business..." said
35908. Pierre hurriedly.
35909. 
35910. "Well, then, au revoir!" said the count, and went out of the room.
35911. 
35912. "Why are you going? Why are you upset?" asked Natasha, and she looked
35913. challengingly into Pierre's eyes.
35914. 
35915. "Because I love you!" was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it,
35916. and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.
35917. 
35918. "Because it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply
35919. I have business...."
35920. 
35921. "Why? No, tell me!" Natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.
35922. 
35923. They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He tried
35924. to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently
35925. kissed her hand and went out.
35926. 
35927. Pierre made up his mind not to go to the Rostovs' any more.
35928. 
35929. 
35930. 
35931. 
35932. 
35933. CHAPTER XXI
35934. 
35935. 
35936. After the definite refusal he had received, Petya went to his room
35937. and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea,
35938. silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to
35939. notice anything.
35940. 
35941. Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the Rostovs'
35942. domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That
35943. morning Petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and
35944. collar to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass,
35945. gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word
35946. to anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to
35947. avoid notice. Petya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and
35948. to explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor
35949. to be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rostov,
35950. in spite of his youth wished to serve his country; that youth could be
35951. no hindrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While
35952. dressing, Petya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the
35953. gentleman-in-waiting.
35954. 
35955. It was on the very fact of being so young that Petya counted for success
35956. in reaching the Emperor--he even thought how surprised everyone would be
35957. at his youthfulness--and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair
35958. and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man.
35959. But the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the
35960. ever-increasing crowds moving toward the Kremlin, the less he remembered
35961. to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man. As he approached
35962. the Kremlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck
35963. out his elbows in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he
35964. was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the
35965. patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his
35966. determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,
35967. rumbling beneath the archway. Beside Petya stood a peasant woman, a
35968. footman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing some
35969. time in the gateway, Petya tried to move forward in front of the others
35970. without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began resolutely
35971. working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in front of him, who
35972. was the first against whom he directed his efforts, angrily shouted at
35973. him:
35974. 
35975. "What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don't you see we're all
35976. standing still? Then why push?"
35977. 
35978. "Anybody can shove," said the footman, and also began working his elbows
35979. to such effect that he pushed Petya into a very filthy corner of the
35980. gateway.
35981. 
35982. Petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp
35983. collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man's.
35984. 
35985. He felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if he were
35986. now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be
35987. admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten oneself up
35988. or move to another place, because of the crowd. One of the generals who
35989. drove past was an acquaintance of the Rostovs', and Petya thought of
35990. asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a
35991. manly thing to do. When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd,
35992. carrying Petya with it, streamed forward into the Kremlin Square which
35993. was already full of people. There were people not only in the square,
35994. but everywhere--on the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as Petya found
35995. himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous
35996. voices of the crowd that filled the whole Kremlin.
35997. 
35998. For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared,
35999. and everyone rushed forward in one direction. Petya was being pressed so
36000. that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, "Hurrah! hurrah!
36001. hurrah!" Petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see
36002. nothing except the people about him.
36003. 
36004. All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A
36005. tradesman's wife standing beside Petya sobbed, and the tears ran down
36006. her cheeks.
36007. 
36008. "Father! Angel! Dear one!" she kept repeating, wiping away her tears
36009. with her fingers.
36010. 
36011. "Hurrah!" was heard on all sides.
36012. 
36013. For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush
36014. forward.
36015. 
36016. Quite beside himself, Petya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes
36017. ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting "hurrah!" as
36018. if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but
36019. on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed
36020. forward and everybody shouted "hurrah!"
36021. 
36022. "So this is what the Emperor is!" thought Petya. "No, I can't petition
36023. him myself--that would be too bold." But in spite of this he continued
36024. to struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those
36025. in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth
36026. spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed back--the police
36027. in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the
36028. procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of
36029. the Assumption--and Petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side
36030. and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim
36031. before his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to himself, a
36032. man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his
36033. head and wearing a shabby blue cassock--probably a church clerk and
36034. chanter--was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off
36035. the pressure of the crowd with the other.
36036. 
36037. "You've crushed the young gentleman!" said the clerk. "What are you up
36038. to? Gently!... They've crushed him, crushed him!"
36039. 
36040. The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread
36041. out again more evenly, and the clerk led Petya--pale and breathless--to
36042. the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for Petya, and suddenly a
36043. crowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those who stood nearest
36044. him attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised
36045. platform of the cannon, and reproached those others (whoever they might
36046. be) who had crushed him.
36047. 
36048. "One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing
36049. people! Poor dear, he's as white as a sheet!"--various voices were heard
36050. saying.
36051. 
36052. Petya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had
36053. passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained
36054. a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who
36055. would be returning that way. Petya no longer thought of presenting his
36056. petition. If he could only see the Emperor he would be happy!
36057. 
36058. While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption--it
36059. was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor's
36060. arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the
36061. Turks--the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling kvas,
36062. gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which Petya was particularly
36063. fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A tradesman's
36064. wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had
36065. cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk
36066. who had rescued Petya was talking to a functionary about the priests who
36067. were officiating that day with the bishop. The clerk several times used
36068. the word "plenary" (of the service), a word Petya did not understand.
36069. Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking
36070. nuts. All these conversations, especially the joking with the girls,
36071. were such as might have had a particular charm for Petya at his age, but
36072. they did not interest him now. He sat on his elevation--the pedestal of
36073. the cannon--still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and
36074. by his love for him. The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced
36075. when he was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still further
36076. intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.
36077. 
36078. Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment,
36079. to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the crowd rushed
36080. impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing. Petya too would
36081. have run there, but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under
36082. his protection stopped him. The firing was still proceeding when
36083. officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the
36084. cathedral, and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were
36085. again raised, and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back
36086. again. At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the
36087. cathedral doors. "Hurrah! hurrah!" shouted the crowd again.
36088. 
36089. "Which is he? Which?" asked Petya in a tearful voice, of those around
36090. him, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and Petya,
36091. fixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the
36092. tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm
36093. on him--though it happened not to be the Emperor--frantically shouted
36094. "Hurrah!" and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the
36095. army.
36096. 
36097. The crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and began
36098. to disperse. It was already late, and Petya had not eaten anything and
36099. was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with
36100. that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while
36101. the Emperor dined--looking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew
36102. not what, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance
36103. to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table,
36104. glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows.
36105. 
36106. While the Emperor was dining, Valuev, looking out of the window, said:
36107. 
36108. "The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again."
36109. 
36110. The dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, rose
36111. and went out onto the balcony. The people, with Petya among them, rushed
36112. toward the balcony.
36113. 
36114. "Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!..." cried the crowd, and Petya with
36115. it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, Petya among them, wept
36116. with joy.
36117. 
36118. A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke
36119. off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A coachman in
36120. a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several
36121. people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had
36122. a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from
36123. the balcony. Petya's eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the
36124. danger of being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why,
36125. but he had to have a biscuit from the Tsar's hand and he felt that he
36126. must not give way. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was
36127. catching at a biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated
36128. though she was lying on the ground--she grabbed at some biscuits but
36129. her hand did not reach them. Petya pushed her hand away with his knee,
36130. seized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted
36131. "Hurrah!" with a voice already hoarse.
36132. 
36133. The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began
36134. to disperse.
36135. 
36136. "There! I said if only we waited--and so it was!" was being joyfully
36137. said by various people.
36138. 
36139. Happy as Petya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all
36140. the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from
36141. the Kremlin, but called on his friend Obolenski, who was fifteen and was
36142. also entering the regiment. On returning home Petya announced resolutely
36143. and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would
36144. run away. And next day, Count Ilya Rostov--though he had not yet quite
36145. yielded--went to inquire how he could arrange for Petya to serve where
36146. there would be least danger.
36147. 
36148. 
36149. 
36150. 
36151. 
36152. CHAPTER XXII
36153. 
36154. 
36155. Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of carriages
36156. were standing outside the Sloboda Palace.
36157. 
36158. The great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry in
36159. their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats
36160. of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemen's hall there was
36161. an incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat on
36162. high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor,
36163. but most of the gentry were strolling about the room.
36164. 
36165. All these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own
36166. houses, were in uniform--some in that of Catherine's day, others in that
36167. of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of Alexander's time or
36168. the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general characteristic
36169. of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these
36170. diverse and familiar personalities, both old and young. The old men,
36171. dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled,
36172. were especially striking. For the most part they sat quietly in their
36173. places and were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached
36174. themselves to someone younger. On all these faces, as on the faces
36175. of the crowd Petya had seen in the Square, there was a striking
36176. contradiction: the general expectation of a solemn event, and at the
36177. same time the everyday interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook,
36178. Zinaida Dmitrievna's health, and so on.
36179. 
36180. Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman's
36181. uniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated;
36182. this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the
36183. merchant-class--les etats generaux (States-General)--evoked in him
36184. a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply
36185. graven in his soul: thoughts of the Contrat social and the French
36186. Revolution. The words that had struck him in the Emperor's appeal--that
36187. the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his
36188. people--strengthened this idea. And imagining that in this direction
36189. something important which he had long awaited was drawing near, he
36190. strolled about watching and listening to conversations, but nowhere
36191. finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him.
36192. 
36193. The Emperor's manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all moved
36194. about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of conversation, Pierre
36195. heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when
36196. the Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperor's
36197. honor, whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole
36198. provinces... and so on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or
36199. what the nobility had been convened for, the talk became undecided and
36200. indefinite. Then all preferred listening to speaking.
36201. 
36202. A middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a retired
36203. naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was
36204. pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round
36205. the speaker and listened. Count Ilya Rostov, in a military uniform of
36206. Catherine's time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd,
36207. with all of whom he was acquainted. He too approached that group and
36208. listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did,
36209. to what the speaker was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very
36210. boldly, as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners
36211. and from the fact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and
36212. quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement
36213. with him. Pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group, listened,
36214. and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal, but of views
36215. quite different from his own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly
36216. sonorous, musical, and aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly
36217. swallowing his r's and generally slurring his consonants: the voice of
36218. a man calling out to his servant, "Heah! Bwing me my pipe!" It was
36219. indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority.
36220. 
36221. "What if the Smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the
36222. Empewah? Ah we to take Smolensk as our patte'n? If the noble awistocwacy
36223. of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty to our
36224. sov'weign the Empewah in other ways. Have we fo'gotten the waising of
36225. the militia in the yeah 'seven? All that did was to enwich the pwiests'
36226. sons and thieves and wobbahs...."
36227. 
36228. Count Ilya Rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval.
36229. 
36230. "And was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only wuined
36231. our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o' ou' men will wetu'n
36232. neithah soldiers no' peasants, and we'll get only depwavity fwom them.
36233. The nobility don't gwudge theah lives--evewy one of us will go and bwing
36234. in more wecwuits, and the sov'weign" (that was the way he referred to
36235. the Emperor) "need only say the word and we'll all die fo' him!" added
36236. the orator with animation.
36237. 
36238. Count Rostov's mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but
36239. Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred,
36240. but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he
36241. opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his
36242. head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the first
36243. speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing debates and
36244. to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones:
36245. 
36246. "I imagine, sir," said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, "that we
36247. have been summoned here not to discuss whether it's best for the empire
36248. at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia.
36249. We have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign
36250. the Emperor has honored us. But to judge what is best--conscription or
36251. the militia--we can leave to the supreme authority...."
36252. 
36253. Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his heart
36254. against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude
36255. into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and
36256. interrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would say, but he
36257. began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French or expressing
36258. himself in bookish Russian.
36259. 
36260. "Excuse me, your excellency," he began. (He was well acquainted with
36261. the senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him
36262. formally.) "Though I don't agree with the gentleman..." (he hesitated:
36263. he wished to say, "Mon tres honorable preopinant"--"My very honorable
36264. opponent") "with the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing,
36265. I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express
36266. their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which
36267. we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine," he went on, warming to his
36268. subject, "that the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us
36269. merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service,
36270. and chair a canon * we are ready to make of ourselves--and not to obtain
36271. from us any co-co-counsel."
36272. 
36273. 
36274.     * "Food for cannon."
36275. 
36276. 
36277. Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator's sarcastic
36278. smile and the freedom of Pierre's remarks. Only Count Rostov was pleased
36279. with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the
36280. senator, and in general with whatever speech he had last heard.
36281. 
36282. "I think that before discussing these questions," Pierre continued, "we
36283. should ask the Emperor--most respectfully ask His Majesty--to let us
36284. know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our
36285. forces now are, and then..."
36286. 
36287. But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from
36288. three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance,
36289. a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him, Stepan
36290. Stepanovich Adraksin. Adraksin was in uniform, and whether as a result
36291. of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a
36292. different man. With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face,
36293. Adraksin shouted at Pierre:
36294. 
36295. "In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor
36296. about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the
36297. Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are moved
36298. according to the enemy's movements and the number of men increases and
36299. decreases..."
36300. 
36301. Another voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years
36302. of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies' and knew as a bad
36303. cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre,
36304. interrupted Adraksin.
36305. 
36306. "Yes, and this is not a time for discussing," he continued, "but for
36307. acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy
36308. Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives
36309. and children." The nobleman smote his breast. "We will all arise, every
36310. one of us will go, for our father the Tsar!" he shouted, rolling his
36311. bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were heard in the crowd. "We
36312. are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith, the
36313. throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of
36314. our Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of
36315. Russia!"
36316. 
36317. Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that his
36318. words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible than the
36319. sound of his opponent's voice.
36320. 
36321. Count Rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several
36322. persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a
36323. phrase, said:
36324. 
36325. "That's right, quite right! Just so!"
36326. 
36327. Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his
36328. serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in
36329. order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many voices
36330. shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count Rostov had not time
36331. to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased, dispersed,
36332. re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and
36333. to the big table. Not only was Pierre's attempt to speak unsuccessful,
36334. but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away
36335. from him as from a common enemy. This happened not because they were
36336. displeased by the substance of his speech, which had even been forgotten
36337. after the many subsequent speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a
36338. tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the
36339. latter. Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in
36340. the same tone. Many spoke eloquently and with originality.
36341. 
36342. Glinka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized (cries
36343. of "author! author!" were heard in the crowd), said that "hell must be
36344. repulsed by hell," and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning
36345. flashes and thunderclaps, but "we will not be that child."
36346. 
36347. "Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!" was repeated approvingly in the back rows
36348. of the crowd.
36349. 
36350. The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald
36351. seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of whom
36352. Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing
36353. boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced
36354. to the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the
36355. chairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together.
36356. Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened
36357. to supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find
36358. some thought and hastened to utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre
36359. knew, sat and turned to look first at one and then at another, and their
36360. faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very
36361. hot. Pierre, however, felt excited, and the general desire to show that
36362. they were ready to go to all lengths--which found expression in the
36363. tones and looks more than in the substance of the speeches--infected him
36364. too. He did not renounce his opinions, but felt himself in some way to
36365. blame and wished to justify himself.
36366. 
36367. "I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices
36368. when we know what is needed!" said he, trying to be heard above the
36369. other voices.
36370. 
36371. One of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention was
36372. immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.
36373. 
36374. "Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!" shouted
36375. one man.
36376. 
36377. "He is the enemy of mankind!" cried another. "Allow me to speak...."
36378. "Gentlemen, you are crushing me!..."
36379. 
36380. 
36381. 
36382. 
36383. 
36384. CHAPTER XXIII
36385. 
36386. 
36387. At that moment Count Rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert eyes,
36388. wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered
36389. the room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.
36390. 
36391. "Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment," said Rostopchin.
36392. "I am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are in, I think
36393. there is little need for discussion. The Emperor has deigned to summon
36394. us and the merchants. Millions will pour forth from there"--he pointed
36395. to the merchants' hall--"but our business is to supply men and not spare
36396. ourselves... That is the least we can do!"
36397. 
36398. A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table.
36399. The whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all the preceding
36400. noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another, "I
36401. agree," or for variety, "I too am of that opinion," and so on had even a
36402. mournful effect.
36403. 
36404. The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow
36405. nobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully equipped,
36406. out of every thousand serfs, as the Smolensk gentry had done. Their
36407. chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose
36408. with apparent relief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to
36409. stretch their legs and converse in couples.
36410. 
36411. "The Emperor! The Emperor!" a sudden cry resounded through the halls and
36412. the whole throng hurried to the entrance.
36413. 
36414. The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of
36415. nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. Pierre
36416. stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From
36417. what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger
36418. threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow
36419. nobility. He was answered by a voice which informed him of the
36420. resolution just arrived at.
36421. 
36422. "Gentlemen!" said the Emperor with a quivering voice.
36423. 
36424. There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that
36425. Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying
36426. with emotion:
36427. 
36428. "I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has
36429. surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the Fatherland!
36430. Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious..."
36431. 
36432. The Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and
36433. rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.
36434. 
36435. "Yes, most precious... a royal word," said Count Rostov, with a sob. He
36436. stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood
36437. everything in his own way.
36438. 
36439. From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants.
36440. There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those who saw him
36441. come out from the merchants' hall with tears of emotion in his eyes.
36442. As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants
36443. before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling
36444. voice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two
36445. merchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat otkupshchik. The other was
36446. the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were
36447. weeping. Tears filled the thin man's eyes, and the fat otkupshchik
36448. sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating:
36449. 
36450. "Our lives and property--take them, Your Majesty!"
36451. 
36452. Pierre's one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was
36453. ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He now
36454. felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought
36455. an opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count Mamonov was
36456. furnishing a regiment, Bezukhov at once informed Rostopchin that he
36457. would give a thousand men and their maintenance.
36458. 
36459. Old Rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and
36460. at once consented to Petya's request and went himself to enter his name.
36461. 
36462. Next day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took off
36463. their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs, and not
36464. without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment,
36465. feeling amazed themselves at what they had done.
36466.

36476. 
36477. CHAPTER I
36478. 
36479. 
36480. Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going
36481. to Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he
36482. received, could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the
36483. stimulating influence of a June morning, and could not refrain from
36484. bursts of anger in the presence of Kurakin and then of Balashev.
36485. 
36486. Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally
36487. insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best
36488. way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great
36489. commander. Rostov charged the French because he could not restrain
36490. his wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same way the
36491. innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their
36492. personal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and aims. They were
36493. moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining
36494. that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will,
36495. but they all were involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work
36496. concealed from them but comprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable
36497. fate of men of action, and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy
36498. the less are they free.
36499. 
36500. The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal
36501. interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that
36502. time but its historic results.
36503. 
36504. Providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to
36505. further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all
36506. expected--neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of those
36507. who did the actual fighting.
36508. 
36509. The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us
36510. now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance
36511. into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for
36512. a winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war
36513. by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused
36514. among the Russian people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems
36515. so evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand
36516. men--the best in the world and led by the best general--could be
36517. destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength,
36518. and led by inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was. Not only
36519. did no one see this, but on the Russian side every effort was made to
36520. hinder the only thing that could save Russia, while on the French side,
36521. despite Napoleon's experience and so-called military genius, every
36522. effort was directed to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer,
36523. that is, to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction.
36524. 
36525. In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of
36526. saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he
36527. sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolensk,
36528. and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign
36529. was even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of telling
36530. us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was
36531. adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some
36532. of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others
36533. to Toll, and others again to Alexander himself--pointing to notes,
36534. projects, and letters which contain hints of such a line of action.
36535. But all these hints at what happened, both from the French side and the
36536. Russian, are advanced only because they fit in with the event. Had that
36537. event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have
36538. forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the
36539. contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because
36540. the event falsified them. There are always so many conjectures as to the
36541. issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people
36542. to say: "I said then that it would be so," quite forgetting that amid
36543. their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.
36544. 
36545. Conjectures as to Napoleon's awareness of the danger of extending his
36546. line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths
36547. of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can
36548. historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals,
36549. or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat
36550. contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period of the war
36551. not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French
36552. into the heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia
36553. everything was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid
36554. to extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and
36555. did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.
36556. 
36557. At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our sole
36558. aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage if we
36559. meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. Our
36560. Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian
36561. soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel's
36562. plan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor
36563. reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could
36564. not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smolensk, still less
36565. could he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did
36566. unite he was displeased that Smolensk was abandoned and burned without a
36567. general engagement having been fought under its walls.
36568. 
36569. So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still
36570. more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the
36571. depths of the country.
36572. 
36573. Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and
36574. missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at
36575. Smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now
36576. see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.
36577. 
36578. The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the
36579. advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then
36580. think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of
36581. Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan,
36582. for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex
36583. interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in
36584. the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one
36585. way of saving Russia. Everything came about fortuitously. The armies
36586. were divided at the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite
36587. them, with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the
36588. enemy's advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle
36589. with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies at
36590. an acute angle--we led the French on to Smolensk. But we withdrew at an
36591. acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies;
36592. the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because
36593. Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagration (who
36594. would come under his command), and Bagration--being in command of the
36595. second army--tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay's
36596. command as long as he could. Bagration was slow in effecting the
36597. junction--though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters--because,
36598. as he alleged, he exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was
36599. best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying
36600. the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for
36601. his army; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under
36602. the command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior
36603. to his own.
36604. 
36605. The Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence and
36606. ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of advisers and
36607. plans, destroyed the first army's energy and it retired.
36608. 
36609. The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci,
36610. aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy
36611. to influence Alexander, and Pfuel's whole plan was abandoned and the
36612. command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspire confidence
36613. his power was limited. The armies were divided, there was no unity of
36614. command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division,
36615. and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted
36616. on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could
36617. not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else,
36618. instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing
36619. indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.
36620. 
36621. At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed
36622. the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary
36623. for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in
36624. general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow
36625. the strength of the Russian army was trebled.
36626. 
36627. He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief's undivided
36628. control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then
36629. be taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and
36630. enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsarevich, and a swarm of adjutants general
36631. remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation
36632. and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under
36633. the observation of all these "eyes of the Emperor," became still more
36634. cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.
36635. 
36636. Barclay stood for caution. The Tsarevich hinted at treachery and
36637. demanded a general engagement. Lubomirski, Bronnitski, Wlocki, and the
36638. others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under
36639. pretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish
36640. adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with
36641. Bennigsen and the Tsarevich.
36642. 
36643. At Smolensk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagration disliked it.
36644. 
36645. Bagration drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay.
36646. Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior
36647. officer Bagration.
36648. 
36649. Despite his seniority in rank Bagration, in this contest of magnanimity,
36650. took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted, agreed with him
36651. less than ever. By the Emperor's orders Bagration reported direct to
36652. him. He wrote to Arakcheev, the Emperor's confidant: "It must be as
36653. my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with the Minister (meaning
36654. Barclay). For God's sake send me somewhere else if only in command of
36655. a regiment. I cannot stand it here. Headquarters are so full of Germans
36656. that a Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything. I thought
36657. I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out
36658. that I am serving Barclay. I confess I do not want to."
36659. 
36660. The swarm of Bronnitskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further
36661. embittered the relations between the commanders in chief, and even
36662. less unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the French before
36663. Smolensk. A general was sent to survey the position. This general,
36664. hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a corps commander,
36665. and, having spent the day with him, returned to Barclay and condemned,
36666. as unsuitable from every point of view, the battleground he had not
36667. seen.
36668. 
36669. While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of
36670. battle, and while we were looking for the French--having lost touch with
36671. them--the French stumbled upon Neverovski's division and reached the
36672. walls of Smolensk.
36673. 
36674. It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolensk to save our
36675. lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were killed
36676. on both sides.
36677. 
36678. Smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the
36679. whole people. But Smolensk was burned by its own inhabitants-who had
36680. been misled by their governor. And these ruined inhabitants, setting
36681. an example to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking only of their own
36682. losses but kindling hatred of the foe. Napoleon advanced farther and we
36683. retired, thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction.
36684. 
36685. 
36686. 
36687. 
36688. 
36689. CHAPTER II
36690. 
36691. 
36692. The day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess Mary
36693. to come to his study.
36694. 
36695. "Well? Are you satisfied now?" said he. "You've made me quarrel with my
36696. son! Satisfied, are you? That's all you wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts
36697. me, it hurts. I'm old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well then,
36698. gloat over it! Gloat over it!"
36699. 
36700. After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He was
36701. ill and did not leave his study.
36702. 
36703. Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the
36704. old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit
36705. Mademoiselle Bourienne either. Tikhon alone attended him.
36706. 
36707. At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way
36708. of life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations
36709. and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his
36710. relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks and cold tone to his
36711. daughter seemed to say: "There, you see? You plotted against me, you
36712. lied to Prince Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made
36713. me quarrel with him, but you see I need neither her nor you!"
36714. 
36715. Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching
36716. his lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to
36717. Dessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her old
36718. nurse, or with "God's folk" who sometimes came by the back door to see
36719. her.
36720. 
36721. Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She
36722. feared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at
36723. the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did not
36724. understand the significance of this war, which seemed to her like all
36725. previous wars. She did not realize the significance of this war, though
36726. Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested
36727. in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her,
36728. and though the "God's folk" who came to see her reported, in their own
36729. way, the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist,
36730. and though Julie (now Princess Drubetskaya), who had resumed
36731. correspondence with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.
36732. 
36733. "I write you in Russian, my good friend," wrote Julie in her Frenchified
36734. Russian, "because I have a detestation for all the French, and the
36735. same for their language which I cannot support to hear spoken.... We in
36736. Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.
36737. 
36738. "My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the
36739. news which I have inspires me yet more.
36740. 
36741. "You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raevski, embracing his two
36742. sons and saying: 'I will perish with them but we will not be shaken!'
36743. And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were
36744. unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The
36745. princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy
36746. widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie, only
36747. you, my friend, are missing..." and so on.
36748. 
36749. The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of
36750. this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize
36751. it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner.
36752. The prince's tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary
36753. unhesitatingly believed him.
36754. 
36755. All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated.
36756. He planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic
36757. serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that
36758. he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual,
36759. changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp
36760. bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the
36761. couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without
36762. undressing, while--instead of Mademoiselle Bourienne--a serf boy read to
36763. him. Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.
36764. 
36765. On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his
36766. first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had
36767. dutifully asked his father's forgiveness for what he had allowed himself
36768. to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old
36769. prince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the
36770. Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrew's second letter, written near
36771. Vitebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of
36772. the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts
36773. as to the further progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew
36774. pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near
36775. the theater of war and on the army's direct line of march, and advised
36776. him to move to Moscow.
36777. 
36778. At dinner that day, on Dessalles' mentioning that the French were said
36779. to have already entered Vitebsk, the old prince remembered his son's
36780. letter.
36781. 
36782. "There was a letter from Prince Andrew today," he said to Princess
36783. Mary--"Haven't you read it?"
36784. 
36785. "No, Father," she replied in a frightened voice.
36786. 
36787. She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had
36788. arrived.
36789. 
36790. "He writes about this war," said the prince, with the ironic smile that
36791. had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.
36792. 
36793. "That must be very interesting," said Dessalles. "Prince Andrew is in a
36794. position to know..."
36795. 
36796. "Oh, very interesting!" said Mademoiselle Bourienne.
36797. 
36798. "Go and get it for me," said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne.
36799. "You know--under the paperweight on the little table."
36800. 
36801. Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.
36802. 
36803. "No, don't!" he exclaimed with a frown. "You go, Michael Ivanovich."
36804. 
36805. Michael Ivanovich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he had left
36806. the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin
36807. and went himself.
36808. 
36809. "They can't do anything... always make some muddle," he muttered.
36810. 
36811. While he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and
36812. even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned
36813. with quick steps, accompanied by Michael Ivanovich, bringing the letter
36814. and a plan. These he put down beside him--not letting anyone read them
36815. at dinner.
36816. 
36817. On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and,
36818. spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his
36819. eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she had done so
36820. Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was examining the
36821. plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.
36822. 
36823. "What do you think of it, Prince?" Dessalles ventured to ask.
36824. 
36825. "I? I?..." said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not taking
36826. his eyes from the plan of the building.
36827. 
36828. "Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that..."
36829. 
36830. "Ha ha ha! The theater of war!" said the prince. "I have said and still
36831. say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get
36832. beyond the Niemen."
36833. 
36834. Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the
36835. Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary,
36836. forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what
36837. her father was saying was correct.
36838. 
36839. "When the snow melts they'll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they
36840. could fail to see it," the prince continued, evidently thinking of the
36841. campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. "Bennigsen should have
36842. advanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different
36843. turn..."
36844. 
36845. "But, Prince," Dessalles began timidly, "the letter mentions
36846. Vitebsk...."
36847. 
36848. "Ah, the letter? Yes..." replied the prince peevishly. "Yes... yes..."
36849. His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. "Yes, he
36850. writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river is it?"
36851. 
36852. Dessalles dropped his eyes.
36853. 
36854. "The prince says nothing about that," he remarked gently.
36855. 
36856. "Doesn't he? But I didn't invent it myself."
36857. 
36858. No one spoke for a long time.
36859. 
36860. "Yes... yes... Well, Michael Ivanovich," he suddenly went on, raising
36861. his head and pointing to the plan of the building, "tell me how you mean
36862. to alter it...."
36863. 
36864. Michael Ivanovich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking to
36865. him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and
36866. went to his own room.
36867. 
36868. Princess Mary saw Dessalles' embarrassed and astonished look fixed on
36869. her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her
36870. father had forgotten his son's letter on the drawing-room table; but she
36871. was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his
36872. confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think about it.
36873. 
36874. In the evening Michael Ivanovich, sent by the prince, came to Princess
36875. Mary for Prince Andrew's letter which had been forgotten in the drawing
36876. room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so,
36877. ventured to ask him what her father was doing.
36878. 
36879. "Always busy," replied Michael Ivanovich with a respectfully ironic
36880. smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. "He's worrying very much
36881. about the new building. He has been reading a little, but now"--Michael
36882. Ivanovich went on, lowering his voice--"now he's at his desk, busy with
36883. his will, I expect." (One of the prince's favorite occupations of late
36884. had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death
36885. and which he called his "will.")
36886. 
36887. "And Alpatych is being sent to Smolensk?" asked Princess Mary.
36888. 
36889. "Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time."
36890. 
36891. 
36892. 
36893. 
36894. 
36895. CHAPTER III
36896. 
36897. 
36898. When Michael Ivanovich returned to the study with the letter, the old
36899. prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his
36900. open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his
36901. outstretched hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his
36902. manuscript--his "Remarks" as he termed it--which was to be transmitted
36903. to the Emperor after his death.
36904. 
36905. When Michael Ivanovich went in there were tears in the prince's eyes
36906. evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had
36907. been written. He took the letter from Michael Ivanovich's hand, put it
36908. in his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alpatych who had long
36909. been waiting.
36910. 
36911. The prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolensk and, walking
36912. up and down the room past Alpatych who stood by the door, he gave his
36913. instructions.
36914. 
36915. "First, notepaper--do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample,
36916. gilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax,
36917. as in Michael Ivanovich's list."
36918. 
36919. He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.
36920. 
36921. "Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed."
36922. 
36923. Next, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be
36924. of a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather case
36925. had to be ordered to keep the "will" in.
36926. 
36927. The instructions to Alpatych took over two hours and still the prince
36928. did not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and
36929. dozed off. Alpatych made a slight movement.
36930. 
36931. "Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted I'll send after you."
36932. 
36933. Alpatych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it,
36934. fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table
36935. to write to the governor.
36936. 
36937. It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished
36938. to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing
36939. thoughts came to him in bed. So he called Tikhon and went through the
36940. rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.
36941. 
36942. He went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed
36943. unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.
36944. That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive
36945. thoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory everywhere,
36946. but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than
36947. other places: he had never slept there yet.
36948. 
36949. With the help of a footman Tikhon brought in the bedstead and began
36950. putting it up.
36951. 
36952. "That's not right! That's not right!" cried the prince, and himself
36953. pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again.
36954. 
36955. "Well, at last I've finished, now I'll rest," thought the prince, and
36956. let Tikhon undress him.
36957. 
36958. Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his
36959. coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the
36960. bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his
36961. withered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring the
36962. moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the
36963. bed. "Ugh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you would
36964. release me!" thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that effort
36965. for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had he done so
36966. before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if
36967. it were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened to him almost every
36968. night. He opened his eyes as they were closing.
36969. 
36970. "No peace, damn them!" he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. "Ah
36971. yes, there was something else important, very important, that I was
36972. keeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them.
36973. No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary
36974. talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something in
36975. my pocket--can't remember..."
36976. 
36977. "Tikhon, what did we talk about at dinner?"
36978. 
36979. "About Prince Michael..."
36980. 
36981. "Be quiet, quiet!" The prince slapped his hand on the table. "Yes, I
36982. know, Prince Andrew's letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said
36983. something about Vitebsk. Now I'll read it."
36984. 
36985. He had the letter taken from his pocket and the table--on which stood a
36986. glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle--moved close to the bed, and
36987. putting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in the stillness of
36988. the night, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he
36989. grasp its meaning for a moment.
36990. 
36991. "The French at Vitebsk, in four days' march they may be at Smolensk;
36992. perhaps are already there! Tikhon!" Tikhon jumped up. "No, no, I don't
36993. want anything!" he shouted.
36994. 
36995. He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there
36996. rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian
36997. camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face,
36998. vigorous and alert, entering Potemkin's gaily colored tent, and a
36999. burning sense of jealousy of "the favorite" agitated him now as strongly
37000. as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that
37001. first meeting with Potemkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather
37002. sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile
37003. and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same
37004. face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Zubov over her
37005. coffin about his right to kiss her hand.
37006. 
37007. "Oh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all
37008. the present! Quicker, quicker--and that they should leave me in peace!"
37009. 
37010. 
37011. 
37012. 
37013. 
37014. CHAPTER IV
37015. 
37016. 
37017. Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolkonski's estate, lay forty miles east
37018. from Smolensk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.
37019. 
37020. The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alpatych,
37021. Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the
37022. prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety,
37023. though from Prince Andrew's letter it was evident that to remain at Bald
37024. Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter
37025. by Alpatych to the Provincial Governor at Smolensk, asking him to let
37026. her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which
37027. Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor
37028. for Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was given to Alpatych with
37029. instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as
37030. possible if there was danger.
37031. 
37032. Having received all his orders Alpatych, wearing a white beaver hat--a
37033. present from the prince--and carrying a stick as the prince did,
37034. went out accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready
37035. harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood.
37036. 
37037. The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed
37038. with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with
37039. ringing bells; but on a long journey Alpatych liked to have them. His
37040. satellites--the senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid,
37041. a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various
37042. domestic serfs--were seeing him off.
37043. 
37044. His daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on and
37045. behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one
37046. of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.
37047. 
37048. "There! There! Women's fuss! Women, women!" said Alpatych, puffing and
37049. speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the trap.
37050. 
37051. After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alpatych, not
37052. trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and
37053. crossed himself three times.
37054. 
37055. "If there is anything... come back, Yakov Alpatych! For Christ's sake
37056. think of us!" cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the
37057. enemy.
37058. 
37059. "Women, women! Women's fuss!" muttered Alpatych to himself and started
37060. on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the
37061. still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just
37062. being plowed a second time.
37063. 
37064. As he went along he looked with pleasure at the year's splendid crop
37065. of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were
37066. already being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the
37067. harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the
37068. prince's orders.
37069. 
37070. Having baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town toward
37071. evening on the fourth of August.
37072. 
37073. Alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the
37074. road. As he approached Smolensk he heard the sounds of distant firing,
37075. but these did not impress him. What struck him most was the sight of a
37076. splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which
37077. was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact
37078. impressed Alpatych, but in thinking about his own business he soon
37079. forgot it.
37080. 
37081. All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been
37082. bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit.
37083. Everything not connected with the execution of the prince's orders did
37084. not interest and did not even exist for Alpatych.
37085. 
37086. On reaching Smolensk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up
37087. in the Gachina suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by Ferapontov,
37088. where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years.
37089. Some thirty years ago Ferapontov, by Alpatych's advice, had bought a
37090. wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an
37091. inn, and a corn dealer's shop in that province. He was a stout, dark,
37092. red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a
37093. nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.
37094. 
37095. Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapontov was standing
37096. before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing Alpatych he went
37097. up to him.
37098. 
37099. "You're welcome, Yakov Alpatych. Folks are leaving the town, but you
37100. have come to it," said he.
37101. 
37102. "Why are they leaving the town?" asked Alpatych.
37103. 
37104. "That's what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French."
37105. 
37106. "Women's fuss, women's fuss!" said Alpatych.
37107. 
37108. "Just what I think, Yakov Alpatych. What I say is: orders have been
37109. given not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants are
37110. asking three rubles for carting--it isn't Christian!"
37111. 
37112. Yakov Alpatych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for hay
37113. for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.
37114. 
37115. All night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning Alpatych
37116. donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a
37117. sunny morning and by eight o'clock it was already hot. "A good day for
37118. harvesting," thought Alpatych.
37119. 
37120. From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At eight
37121. o'clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry. Many
37122. people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers,
37123. but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and
37124. service was being held in the churches as usual. Alpatych went to the
37125. shops, to government offices, to the post office, and to the Governor's.
37126. In the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking
37127. about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town,
37128. everybody was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm
37129. one another.
37130. 
37131. In front of the Governor's house Alpatych found a large number of
37132. people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor's. At the
37133. porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an
37134. ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:
37135. 
37136. "It's no joke, you know! It's all very well if you're single. 'One man
37137. though undone is but one,' as the proverb says, but with thirteen in
37138. your family and all the property... They've brought us to utter ruin!
37139. What sort of governors are they to do that? They ought to be hanged--the
37140. brigands!..."
37141. 
37142. "Oh come, that's enough!" said the other.
37143. 
37144. "What do I care? Let him hear! We're not dogs," said the ex-captain of
37145. police, and looking round he noticed Alpatych.
37146. 
37147. "Oh, Yakov Alpatych! What have you come for?"
37148. 
37149. "To see the Governor by his excellency's order," answered Alpatych,
37150. lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his
37151. coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince.... "He has ordered
37152. me to inquire into the position of affairs," he added.
37153. 
37154. "Yes, go and find out!" shouted the angry gentleman. "They've brought
37155. things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!... There it
37156. is again, do you hear?" said he, pointing in the direction whence came
37157. the sounds of firing.
37158. 
37159. "They've brought us all to ruin... the brigands!" he repeated, and
37160. descended the porch steps.
37161. 
37162. Alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were
37163. tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another. The
37164. door of the Governor's room opened and they all rose and moved forward.
37165. An official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called a stout
37166. official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and vanished
37167. again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions
37168. addressed to him. Alpatych moved forward and next time the official came
37169. out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat,
37170. and handed him two letters.
37171. 
37172. "To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkonski," he
37173. announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned
37174. to him and took the letters.
37175. 
37176. A few minutes later the Governor received Alpatych and hurriedly said to
37177. him:
37178. 
37179. "Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on the
37180. highest instructions--here..." and he handed a paper to Alpatych.
37181. "Still, as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to
37182. Moscow. I am just starting myself. Inform them..."
37183. 
37184. But the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into the
37185. room and began to say something in French. The Governor's face expressed
37186. terror.
37187. 
37188. "Go," he said, nodding his head to Alpatych, and began questioning the
37189. officer.
37190. 
37191. Eager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alpatych when he came
37192. out of the Governor's room. Involuntarily listening now to the firing,
37193. which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength, Alpatych hurried
37194. to his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:
37195. 
37196. 
37197. "I assure you that the town of Smolensk is not in the slightest danger
37198. as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any. I from
37199. the one side and Prince Bagration from the other are marching to unite
37200. our forces before Smolensk, which junction will be effected on the
37201. 22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces will defend our
37202. compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts
37203. shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland, or till the last
37204. warrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From this you will see that
37205. you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of Smolensk, for
37206. those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory."
37207. (Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of
37208. Smolensk, 1812.)
37209. 
37210. 
37211. People were anxiously roaming about the streets.
37212. 
37213. Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept
37214. emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets.
37215. Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferapontov's and women were
37216. wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round
37217. barking in front of the harnessed horses.
37218. 
37219. Alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went
37220. straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was
37221. asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage.
37222. From the host's room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing
37223. sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of Ferapontov. The cook
37224. began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen,
37225. just as Alpatych entered.
37226. 
37227. "He's done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged her
37228. about so!..."
37229. 
37230. "What for?" asked Alpatych.
37231. 
37232. "She kept begging to go away. She's a woman! 'Take me away,' says she,
37233. 'don't let me perish with my little children! Folks,' she says, 'are all
37234. gone, so why,' she says, 'don't we go?' And he began beating and pulling
37235. her about so!"
37236. 
37237. At these words Alpatych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to
37238. hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper's, where
37239. he had left his purchases.
37240. 
37241. "You brute, you murderer!" screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby
37242. in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through the door
37243. at that moment and down the steps into the yard.
37244. 
37245. Ferapontov came out after her, but on seeing Alpatych adjusted his
37246. waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alpatych into the
37247. opposite room.
37248. 
37249. "Going already?" said he.
37250. 
37251. Alpatych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages
37252. and asked how much he owed.
37253. 
37254. "We'll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor's?" asked
37255. Ferapontov. "What has been decided?"
37256. 
37257. Alpatych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.
37258. 
37259. "With our business, how can we get away?" said Ferapontov. "We'd have
37260. to pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobuzh and I tell them they're
37261. not Christians to ask it! Selivanov, now, did a good stroke last
37262. Thursday--sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have
37263. some tea?" he added.
37264. 
37265. While the horses were being harnessed Alpatych and Ferapontov over their
37266. tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for
37267. harvesting.
37268. 
37269. "Well, it seems to be getting quieter," remarked Ferapontov, finishing
37270. his third cup of tea and getting up. "Ours must have got the best of it.
37271. The orders were not to let them in. So we're in force, it seems....
37272. They say the other day Matthew Ivanych Platov drove them into the river
37273. Marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day."
37274. 
37275. Alpatych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had come
37276. in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and
37277. bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out.
37278. 
37279. It was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the
37280. other half brightly lit by the sun. Alpatych looked out of the window
37281. and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling
37282. and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull
37283. roar that set the windows rattling.
37284. 
37285. He went out into the street: two men were running past toward the
37286. bridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of
37287. cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds
37288. were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the
37289. town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was
37290. being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered
37291. up after four o'clock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of
37292. this bombardment.
37293. 
37294. At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused
37295. curiosity. Ferapontov's wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under
37296. the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate,
37297. listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.
37298. 
37299. The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively curiosity
37300. everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over
37301. their heads. Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.
37302. 
37303. "What force!" remarked one. "Knocked the roof and ceiling all to
37304. splinters!"
37305. 
37306. "Routed up the earth like a pig," said another.
37307. 
37308. "That's grand, it bucks one up!" laughed the first. "Lucky you jumped
37309. aside, or it would have wiped you out!"
37310. 
37311. Others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen
37312. on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now with
37313. the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable
37314. intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people's heads incessantly,
37315. but not one fell close by, they all flew over. Alpatych was getting into
37316. his trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.
37317. 
37318. "What are you staring at?" he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt,
37319. with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the
37320. corner to listen to what was being said.
37321. 
37322. "What marvels!" she exclaimed, but hearing her master's voice she turned
37323. back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.
37324. 
37325. Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping
37326. downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the
37327. street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.
37328. 
37329. "Scoundrel, what are you doing?" shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the
37330. cook.
37331. 
37332. At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different
37333. sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently
37334. with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her
37335. wailing.
37336. 
37337. "Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don't let me die! My good
37338. souls!..."
37339. 
37340. Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her
37341. thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen.
37342. Alpatych, his coachman, Ferapontov's wife and children and the house
37343. porter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, the
37344. whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook, which
37345. rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The mistress
37346. rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked
37347. in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained
37348. in the street. A shopman who entered told her that her husband had
37349. gone with others to the cathedral, whence they were fetching the
37350. wonder-working icon of Smolensk.
37351. 
37352. Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alpatych left the cellar
37353. and stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was
37354. clouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon
37355. shone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush
37356. seemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of footsteps,
37357. the moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed
37358. widespread everywhere. The cook's moans had now subsided. On two sides
37359. black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires. Through
37360. the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in
37361. different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them
37362. ran into Ferapontov's yard before Alpatych's eyes. Alpatych went out
37363. to the gate. A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the
37364. street.
37365. 
37366. Noticing him, an officer said: "The town is being abandoned. Get away,
37367. get away!" and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:
37368. 
37369. "I'll teach you to run into the yards!"
37370. 
37371. Alpatych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to
37372. set off. Ferapontov's whole household came out too, following Alpatych
37373. and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly
37374. began to wail as they looked at the fires--the smoke and even the flames
37375. of which could be seen in the failing twilight--and as if in reply
37376. the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street.
37377. Inside the shed Alpatych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and
37378. traces of their horses with trembling hands.
37379. 
37380. As Alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in
37381. Ferapontov's open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and
37382. knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapontov returned
37383. and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at
37384. them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs
37385. and laughter:
37386. 
37387. "Loot everything, lads! Don't let those devils get it!" he cried, taking
37388. some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.
37389. 
37390. Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on
37391. filling their bags. On seeing Alpatych, Ferapontov turned to him:
37392. 
37393. "Russia is done for!" he cried. "Alpatych, I'll set the place on fire
37394. myself. We're done for!..." and Ferapontov ran into the yard.
37395. 
37396. Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking
37397. it completely, so that Alpatych could not pass out and had to wait.
37398. Ferapontov's wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till
37399. it was possible to drive out.
37400. 
37401. Night had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out
37402. amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper
37403. Alpatych's cart and that of the innkeeper's wife, which were slowly
37404. moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop.
37405. In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a
37406. house and some shops were on fire. This fire was already burning itself
37407. out. The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now
37408. suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness
37409. the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads. Black figures
37410. flitted about before the fire, and through the incessant crackling of
37411. the flames talking and shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap
37412. would not be able to move on for some time, Alpatych got down and turned
37413. into the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers were continually
37414. rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he saw two of them and a
37415. man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the
37416. street, while others carried bundles of hay.
37417. 
37418. Alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was
37419. blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen
37420. in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters were alight. The
37421. crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and Alpatych
37422. watched for it too.
37423. 
37424. "Alpatych!" a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.
37425. 
37426. "Mercy on us! Your excellency!" answered Alpatych, immediately
37427. recognizing the voice of his young prince.
37428. 
37429. Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking
37430. at Alpatych from the back of the crowd.
37431. 
37432. "Why are you here?" he asked.
37433. 
37434. "Your... your excellency," stammered Alpatych and broke into sobs. "Are
37435. we really lost? Master!..."
37436. 
37437. "Why are you here?" Prince Andrew repeated.
37438. 
37439. At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master's pale
37440. worn face. Alpatych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it
37441. was to get away.
37442. 
37443. "Are we really quite lost, your excellency?" he asked again.
37444. 
37445. Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee
37446. began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:
37447. 
37448. 
37449. "Smolensk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy
37450. within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when
37451. you will start. Send by special messenger to Usvyazh."
37452. 
37453. 
37454. Having written this and given the paper to Alpatych, he told him how
37455. to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the
37456. boy's tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before
37457. he had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff
37458. followed by a suite galloped up to him.
37459. 
37460. "You are a colonel?" shouted the chief of staff with a German accent,
37461. in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. "Houses are set on fire in your
37462. presence and you stand by! What does this mean? You will answer for
37463. it!" shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the
37464. commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army, a place,
37465. as Berg said, "very agreeable and well en evidence."
37466. 
37467. Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to
37468. Alpatych.
37469. 
37470. "So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by the
37471. tenth I don't receive news that they have all got away I shall have to
37472. throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills."
37473. 
37474. "Prince," said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, "I only spoke because
37475. I have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly.... You must
37476. please excuse me," he went on apologetically.
37477. 
37478. Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and
37479. wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another
37480. terrible crash and something huge collapsed.
37481. 
37482. "Ou-rou-rou!" yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof
37483. of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all
37484. around. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, delighted,
37485. exhausted faces of the spectators.
37486. 
37487. The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:
37488. 
37489. "It's fine, lads! Now it's raging... It's fine!"
37490. 
37491. "That's the owner himself," cried several voices.
37492. 
37493. "Well then," continued Prince Andrew to Alpatych, "report to them as I
37494. have told you"; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside
37495. him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.
37496. 
37497. 
37498. 
37499. 
37500. 
37501. CHAPTER V
37502. 
37503. 
37504. From Smolensk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the enemy.
37505. On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching
37506. along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat and
37507. drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day fleecy clouds
37508. floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward
37509. evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist.
37510. Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was
37511. scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from
37512. hunger, finding no food on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and
37513. in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the
37514. road, the highroad along which the troops marched, there was no such
37515. freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest; the
37516. dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches
37517. deep. As soon as day dawned the march began. The artillery and baggage
37518. wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very
37519. hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft,
37520. choking, hot dust that never cooled even at night. Some of this dust
37521. was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a
37522. cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and
37523. worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that
37524. road. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and
37525. through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked
37526. eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded
37527. sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless
37528. atmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and
37529. mouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells
37530. and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.
37531. 
37532. Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of that
37533. regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving
37534. and giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smolensk and its
37535. abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against
37536. the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the
37537. affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and
37538. officers. In the regiment they called him "our prince," were proud
37539. of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to those of his
37540. regiment, to Timokhin and the like--people quite new to him, belonging
37541. to a different world and who could not know and understand his past. As
37542. soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the
37543. staff, he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful, ironical, and
37544. contemptuous. Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to
37545. him, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself
37546. to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.
37547. 
37548. In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to
37549. Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolensk on the sixth
37550. of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended)
37551. and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to
37552. pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled.
37553. But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to
37554. think about entirely apart from general questions. Two days previously
37555. he had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for
37556. Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince
37557. Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that
37558. he must ride there.
37559. 
37560. He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the
37561. march, rode to his father's estate where he had been born and spent his
37562. childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens
37563. of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden
37564. beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that
37565. the little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was
37566. floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper's
37567. lodge. No one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door
37568. stood open. Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and
37569. horses and calves were straying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode
37570. up to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the
37571. trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up. He called for
37572. Taras the gardener, but no one replied. Having gone round the corner
37573. of the hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw that the carved garden
37574. fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with
37575. the fruit. An old peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often
37576. seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast
37577. shoe.
37578. 
37579. He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on
37580. the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of
37581. bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.
37582. 
37583. Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had
37584. been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of
37585. the house among the rosebushes. The shutters were all closed, except at
37586. one window which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran
37587. into the house. Alpatych, having sent his family away, was alone at
37588. Bald Hills and was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints. On
37589. hearing that Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on
37590. his nose, buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word
37591. began weeping and kissing Prince Andrew's knee.
37592. 
37593. Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report
37594. on the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable had been
37595. removed to Bogucharovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted
37596. away. The hay and the spring corn, of which Alpatych said there had been
37597. a remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered by the troops and
37598. mown down while still green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too
37599. had gone to Bogucharovo, only a few remained.
37600. 
37601. Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:
37602. 
37603. "When did my father and sister leave?" meaning when did they leave for
37604. Moscow.
37605. 
37606. Alpatych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for
37607. Bogucharovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again went
37608. into details concerning the estate management, asking for instructions.
37609. 
37610. "Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?
37611. We have still six hundred quarters left," he inquired.
37612. 
37613. "What am I to say to him?" thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the
37614. old man's bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on
37615. his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions
37616. were and only asked them to allay his grief.
37617. 
37618. "Yes, let them have it," replied Prince Andrew.
37619. 
37620. "If you noticed some disorder in the garden," said Alpatych, "it was
37621. impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent
37622. the night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their
37623. commanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it."
37624. 
37625. "Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy
37626. occupies the place?" asked Prince Andrew.
37627. 
37628. Alpatych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and suddenly
37629. with a solemn gesture raised his arm.
37630. 
37631. "He is my refuge! His will be done!" he exclaimed.
37632. 
37633. A group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward
37634. the prince.
37635. 
37636. "Well, good-by!" said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alpatych. "You
37637. must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the
37638. Ryazan estate or to the one near Moscow."
37639. 
37640. Alpatych clung to Prince Andrew's leg and burst into sobs. Gently
37641. disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the
37642. avenue at a gallop.
37643. 
37644. The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly
37645. impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on
37646. which he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out
37647. from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from
37648. the trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young master,
37649. the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the
37650. hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some
37651. green plums they had dropped.
37652. 
37653. Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them
37654. see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened
37655. little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible
37656. desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him
37657. when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of other human
37658. interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those
37659. that occupied him. Evidently these girls passionately desired one
37660. thing--to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught--and
37661. Prince Andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise. He
37662. could not resist looking at them once more. Believing their danger past,
37663. they sprang from their ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill
37664. little voices and holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned
37665. feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.
37666. 
37667. Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty
37668. highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills
37669. he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting
37670. place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one o'clock. The sun,
37671. a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably
37672. through his black coat. The dust always hung motionless above the buzz
37673. of talk that came from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he
37674. crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the
37675. pond. He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and
37676. he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and
37677. laughter. The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a
37678. foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies
37679. of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing
37680. about in it. All this naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking,
37681. floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering
37682. can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered
37683. it specially pathetic.
37684. 
37685. One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince Andrew
37686. knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed himself,
37687. stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water; another,
37688. a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up to his
37689. waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted
37690. with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands
37691. blackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men slapping one another,
37692. yelling, and puffing.
37693. 
37694. Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy,
37695. white, muscular flesh. The officer, Timokhin, with his red little nose,
37696. standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing
37697. the prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.
37698. 
37699. "It's very nice, your excellency! Wouldn't you like to?" said he.
37700. 
37701. "It's dirty," replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.
37702. 
37703. "We'll clear it out for you in a minute," said Timokhin, and, still
37704. undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.
37705. 
37706. "The prince wants to bathe."
37707. 
37708. "What prince? Ours?" said many voices, and the men were in such haste
37709. to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He decided that he
37710. would rather wash himself with water in the barn.
37711. 
37712. "Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!" he thought, and he looked at his own
37713. naked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust
37714. and horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that
37715. immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.
37716. 
37717. 
37718. On the seventh of August Prince Bagration wrote as follows from his
37719. quarters at Mikhaylovna on the Smolensk road:
37720. 
37721. 
37722. Dear Count Alexis Andreevich--(He was writing to Arakcheev but knew that
37723. his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every
37724. word in it to the best of his ability.)
37725. 
37726. I expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the
37727. abandonment of Smolensk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and
37728. the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been
37729. wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently
37730. and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear
37731. to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and
37732. might have lost half his army but could not have taken Smolensk. Our
37733. troops fought, and are fighting, as never before. With fifteen thousand
37734. men I held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he
37735. would not hold out even for fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain
37736. on our army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If
37737. he reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about
37738. four thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were they ten
37739. thousand, that's war! But the enemy has lost masses...
37740. 
37741. What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They would
37742. have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men
37743. or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent
37744. instructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this
37745. way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow...
37746. 
37747. There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you
37748. should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You
37749. would set all Russia against you and every one of us would feel ashamed
37750. to wear the uniform. If it has come to this--we must fight as long as
37751. Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand...
37752. 
37753. One man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may perhaps
37754. be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad but
37755. execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I
37756. am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear
37757. that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the
37758. Minister should command the army, does not love our sovereign and
37759. desires the ruin of us all. So I write you frankly: call out the
37760. militia. For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow
37761. in a most masterly way. The whole army feels great suspicion of the
37762. Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is said to be more Napoleon's man
37763. than ours, and he is always advising the Minister. I am not merely civil
37764. to him but obey him like a corporal, though I am his senior. This is
37765. painful, but, loving my benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am
37766. sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he.
37767. Consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the
37768. hospital more than fifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would
37769. not have happened. Tell me, for God's sake, what will Russia, our mother
37770. Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning our
37771. good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of
37772. hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and of whom
37773. are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is vacillating,
37774. a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The whole army
37775. bewails it and calls down curses upon him...
37776. 
37777. 
37778. 
37779. 
37780. 
37781. CHAPTER VI
37782. 
37783. 
37784. Among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human
37785. life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails
37786. and those in which form prevails. To the latter--as distinguished
37787. from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow life--we may allot
37788. Petersburg life, and especially the life of its salons. That life of
37789. the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had
37790. again quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade
37791. them again, but the salons of Anna Pavlovna and Helene remained just as
37792. they had been--the one seven and the other five years before. At Anna
37793. Pavlovna's they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte's successes just
37794. as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the
37795. European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was
37796. to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna
37797. Pavlovna was the representative. And in Helene's salon, which Rumyantsev
37798. himself honored with his visits, regarding Helene as a remarkably
37799. intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808
37800. of the "great nation" and the "great man," and regretted our rupture
37801. with France, a rupture which, according to them, ought to be promptly
37802. terminated by peace.
37803. 
37804. Of late, since the Emperor's return from the army, there had been some
37805. excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations
37806. of hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency.
37807. In Anna Pavlovna's circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were
37808. deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the
37809. effect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to
37810. maintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole
37811. army corps. The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only
37812. the reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French
37813. circle of Helene and Rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the
37814. enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon's attempts at
37815. conciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those
37816. who advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kazan of the court and
37817. the girls' educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager
37818. Empress. In Helene's circle the war in general was regarded as a series
37819. of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the
37820. view prevailed expressed by Bilibin--who now in Petersburg was quite
37821. at home in Helene's house, which every clever man was obliged to
37822. visit--that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters
37823. be settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm--news of which had
37824. reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor's return--was
37825. ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.
37826. 
37827. Anna Pavlovna's circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm
37828. and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients.
37829. Prince Vasili, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a
37830. connecting link between these two circles. He visited his "good friend
37831. Anna Pavlovna" as well as his daughter's "diplomatic salon," and often
37832. in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused
37833. and said at Helene's what he should have said at Anna Pavlovna's and
37834. vice versa.
37835. 
37836. Soon after the Emperor's return Prince Vasili in a conversation about
37837. the war at Anna Pavlovna's severely condemned Barclay de Tolly, but was
37838. undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief. One of the
37839. visitors, usually spoken of as "a man of great merit," having described
37840. how he had that day seen Kutuzov, the newly chosen chief of the
37841. Petersburg militia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the
37842. Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest that Kutuzov would be the man
37843. to satisfy all requirements.
37844. 
37845. Anna Pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutuzov had done
37846. nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.
37847. 
37848. "I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility," Prince
37849. Vasili interrupted, "but they did not listen to me. I told them his
37850. election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They did
37851. not listen to me.
37852. 
37853. "It's all this mania for opposition," he went on. "And who for? It is
37854. all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,"
37855. Prince Vasili continued, forgetting for a moment that though at Helene's
37856. one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna Pavlovna's one had to
37857. be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. "Now, is
37858. it suitable that Count Kutuzov, the oldest general in Russia, should
37859. preside at that tribunal? He will get nothing for his pains! How could
37860. they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse, who drops
37861. asleep at a council, and has the very worst morals! A good reputation
37862. he made for himself at Bucharest! I don't speak of his capacity as a
37863. general, but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit, blind old
37864. man, positively blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He can't see
37865. anything. To play blindman's bluff? He can't see at all!"
37866. 
37867. No one replied to his remarks.
37868. 
37869. This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the
37870. twenty-ninth of July Kutuzov received the title of Prince. This might
37871. indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vasili's opinion
37872. continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express
37873. it. But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting of Field Marshal
37874. Saltykov, Arakcheev, Vyazmitinov, Lopukhin, and Kochubey met to consider
37875. the progress of the war. This committee came to the conclusion that
37876. our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the
37877. members of the committee were aware of the Emperor's dislike of Kutuzov,
37878. after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as
37879. commander in chief. That same day Kutuzov was appointed commander
37880. in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region
37881. occupied by them.
37882. 
37883. On the ninth of August Prince Vasili at Anna Pavlovna's again met the
37884. "man of great merit." The latter was very attentive to Anna Pavlovna
37885. because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational
37886. establishments for young ladies. Prince Vasili entered the room with the
37887. air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.
37888. 
37889. "Well, have you heard the great news? Prince Kutuzov is field marshal!
37890. All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At last
37891. we have a man!" said he, glancing sternly and significantly round at
37892. everyone in the drawing room.
37893. 
37894. The "man of great merit," despite his desire to obtain the post of
37895. director, could not refrain from reminding Prince Vasili of his former
37896. opinion. Though this was impolite to Prince Vasili in Anna Pavlovna's
37897. drawing room, and also to Anna Pavlovna herself who had received the
37898. news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.
37899. 
37900. "But, Prince, they say he is blind!" said he, reminding Prince Vasili of
37901. his own words.
37902. 
37903. "Eh? Nonsense! He sees well enough," said Prince Vasili rapidly, in a
37904. deep voice and with a slight cough--the voice and cough with which he
37905. was wont to dispose of all difficulties.
37906. 
37907. "He sees well enough," he added. "And what I am so pleased about," he
37908. went on, "is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all
37909. the armies and the whole region--powers no commander in chief ever had
37910. before. He is a second autocrat," he concluded with a victorious smile.
37911. 
37912. "God grant it! God grant it!" said Anna Pavlovna.
37913. 
37914. The "man of great merit," who was still a novice in court circles,
37915. wishing to flatter Anna Pavlovna by defending her former position on
37916. this question, observed:
37917. 
37918. "It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutuzov those powers.
37919. They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read, when he said to
37920. Kutuzov: 'Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.'"
37921. 
37922. "Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech," said Anna Pavlovna.
37923. 
37924. "Oh, no, no!" warmly rejoined Prince Vasili, who would not now yield
37925. Kutuzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutuzov was not only admirable
37926. himself, but was adored by everybody. "No, that's impossible," said he,
37927. "for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before."
37928. 
37929. "God grant only that Prince Kutuzov assumes real power and does not
37930. allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel," observed Anna Pavlovna.
37931. 
37932. Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasili said in a
37933. whisper:
37934. 
37935. "I know for a fact that Kutuzov made it an absolute condition that the
37936. Tsarevich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the
37937. Emperor?"
37938. 
37939. And Prince Vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by
37940. Kutuzov to the Emperor. "I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor
37941. reward him if he does right."
37942. 
37943. "Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutuzov! I have known him a long time!"
37944. 
37945. "They even say," remarked the "man of great merit" who did not yet
37946. possess courtly tact, "that his excellency made it an express condition
37947. that the sovereign himself should not be with the army."
37948. 
37949. As soon as he said this both Prince Vasili and Anna Pavlovna turned away
37950. from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naivete.
37951. 
37952. 
37953. 
37954. 
37955. 
37956. CHAPTER VII
37957. 
37958. 
37959. While this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already passed
37960. Smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. Napoleon's
37961. historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to justify his
37962. hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against his will. He
37963. is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic
37964. events in the will of one man; he is as right as the Russian historians
37965. who maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the
37966. Russian commanders. Here besides the law of retrospection, which regards
37967. all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur,
37968. the law of reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good
37969. chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss
37970. resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the
37971. opening, but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar
37972. mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect. He only notices the
37973. mistake to which he pays attention, because his opponent took advantage
37974. of it. How much more complex than this is the game of war, which
37975. occurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will that
37976. manipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from innumerable
37977. conflicts of various wills!
37978. 
37979. After Smolensk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobuzh at Vyazma, and
37980. then at Tsarevo-Zaymishche, but it happened that owing to a conjunction
37981. of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give battle till
37982. they reached Borodino, seventy miles from Moscow. From Vyazma Napoleon
37983. ordered a direct advance on Moscow.
37984. 
37985. Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacree des
37986. peuples d'Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme de
37987. pagodes chinoises, * this Moscow gave Napoleon's imagination no rest.
37988. On the march from Vyazma to Tsarevo-Zaymishche he rode his light bay
37989. bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages,
37990. and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to
37991. question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by
37992. Lelorgne d'Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop
37993. and reined in his horse with an amused expression.
37994. 
37995. 
37996.      * "Moscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the
37997.      sacred city of Alexander's people, Moscow with its
37998.      innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas."
37999. 
38000. 
38001. "Well?" asked Napoleon.
38002. 
38003. "One of Platov's Cossacks says that Platov's corps is joining up with
38004. the main army and that Kutuzov has been appointed commander in chief. He
38005. is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow."
38006. 
38007. Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the
38008. man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped
38009. off, and an hour later, Lavrushka, the serf Denisov had handed over
38010. to Rostov, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly's jacket and on a French
38011. cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride
38012. by his side and began questioning him.
38013. 
38014. "You are a Cossack?"
38015. 
38016. "Yes, a Cossack, your Honor."
38017. 
38018. "The Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon's plain
38019. appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind
38020. the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the
38021. incidents of the war," says Thiers, narrating this episode. In
38022. reality Lavrushka, having got drunk the day before and left his master
38023. dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of
38024. chickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him prisoner.
38025. Lavrushka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all
38026. sorts of things, consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and
38027. cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master,
38028. and are keen at guessing their master's baser impulses, especially those
38029. prompted by vanity and pettiness.
38030. 
38031. Finding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had easily
38032. and surely recognized, Lavrushka was not in the least abashed but merely
38033. did his utmost to gain his new master's favor.
38034. 
38035. He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon's presence could
38036. no more intimidate him than Rostov's, or a sergeant major's with the
38037. rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major
38038. or Napoleon could deprive him of.
38039. 
38040. So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the
38041. orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the
38042. Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavrushka screwed up
38043. his eyes and considered.
38044. 
38045. In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning
38046. in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.
38047. 
38048. "It's like this," he said thoughtfully, "if there's a battle soon, yours
38049. will win. That's right. But if three days pass, then after that, well,
38050. then that same battle will not soon be over."
38051. 
38052. Lelorgne d'Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus:
38053. "If a battle takes place within the next three days the French will
38054. win, but if later, God knows what will happen." Napoleon did not smile,
38055. though he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words
38056. to be repeated.
38057. 
38058. Lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to
38059. know who Napoleon was, added:
38060. 
38061. "We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in
38062. the world, but we are a different matter..."--without knowing why or how
38063. this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.
38064. 
38065. The interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and
38066. Bonaparte smiled. "The young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor
38067. smile," says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence, Napoleon
38068. turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was
38069. talking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who had written his
38070. immortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would affect this enfant du
38071. Don. *
38072. 
38073. 
38074.     * "Child of the Don."
38075. 
38076. 
38077. The fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrushka.
38078. 
38079. Lavrushka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that
38080. Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters
38081. promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes
38082. wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be
38083. whipped. "As soon as Napoleon's interpreter had spoken," says Thiers,
38084. "the Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode
38085. on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across
38086. the steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and
38087. replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after
38088. making the Cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to
38089. its native fields."
38090. 
38091. Napoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his
38092. imagination, and "the bird restored to its native fields" galloped to
38093. our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that
38094. he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place he did
38095. not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. He
38096. found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with Platov's
38097. detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas Rostov, quartered
38098. at Yankovo. Rostov was just mounting to go for a ride round the
38099. neighboring villages with Ilyin; he let Lavrushka have another horse and
38100. took him along with him.
38101. 
38102. 
38103. 
38104. 
38105. 
38106. CHAPTER VIII
38107. 
38108. 
38109. Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew
38110. supposed.
38111. 
38112. After the return of Alpatych from Smolensk the old prince suddenly
38113. seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called
38114. up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in
38115. chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the
38116. last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief's
38117. discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where
38118. one of Russia's oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he
38119. announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills.
38120. 
38121. But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of
38122. the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Bogucharovo and
38123. thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her father's feverish and
38124. sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to
38125. leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey
38126. him. She refused to go away and her father's fury broke over her in a
38127. terrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on
38128. her. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused
38129. his quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making
38130. it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from
38131. his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same
38132. to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and
38133. warned her not to dare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as
38134. she had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her
38135. not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof
38136. that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and
38137. had not gone away.
38138. 
38139. The morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned his
38140. full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His caleche
38141. was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in
38142. his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his
38143. armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window listening to
38144. his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly several men came
38145. running up the avenue with frightened faces.
38146. 
38147. Princess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path, and
38148. into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving
38149. toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by
38150. the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and
38151. decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that
38152. fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,
38153. could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see
38154. was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one
38155. of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his helpless
38156. lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out what he
38157. wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on the very
38158. couch he had so feared of late.
38159. 
38160. The doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the
38161. prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.
38162. 
38163. It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and
38164. next day they moved the prince to Bogucharovo, the doctor accompanying
38165. him.
38166. 
38167. By the time they reached Bogucharovo, Dessalles and the little prince
38168. had already left for Moscow.
38169. 
38170. For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new
38171. house Prince Andrew had built at Bogucharovo, ever in the same state,
38172. getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like
38173. a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips
38174. twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was
38175. going on around him or not. One thing was certain--that he was suffering
38176. and wished to say something. But what it was, no one could tell: it
38177. might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate
38178. to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.
38179. 
38180. The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due
38181. to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell
38182. her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his
38183. restlessness confirmed her opinion.
38184. 
38185. He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no
38186. hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do
38187. to let him die on the road. "Would it not be better if the end did come,
38188. the very end?" Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly
38189. sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched
38190. him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find
38191. symptoms of the approach of the end.
38192. 
38193. Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet
38194. there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since
38195. her father's illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with
38196. him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires and hopes
38197. that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts
38198. that had not entered her mind for years--thoughts of a life free from
38199. the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and of family
38200. happiness--floated continually in her imagination like temptations
38201. of the devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions continually
38202. recurred to her as to how she would order her life now, after that.
38203. These were temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it. She knew
38204. that the sole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She
38205. assumed an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons, repeated the words
38206. of a prayer, but she could not pray. She felt that a different world had
38207. now taken possession of her--the life of a world of strenuous and free
38208. activity, quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she
38209. had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer.
38210. She could not pray, could not weep, and worldly cares took possession of
38211. her.
38212. 
38213. It was becoming dangerous to remain in Bogucharovo. News of the approach
38214. of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten miles from
38215. Bogucharovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.
38216. 
38217. The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the
38218. provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary
38219. to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the
38220. rural police having come to Bogucharovo urged the same thing, saying
38221. that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that French
38222. proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the princess
38223. did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could not answer
38224. for the consequences.
38225. 
38226. The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of preparation
38227. and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day.
38228. She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in
38229. the room next to the one where the prince lay. Several times, waking up,
38230. she heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps
38231. of Tikhon and the doctor when they turned him over. Several times she
38232. listened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were
38233. louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not
38234. sleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter
38235. but not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw
38236. and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him.
38237. She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she
38238. sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in during
38239. the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.
38240. 
38241. But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing
38242. him. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his
38243. found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid these memories
38244. temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: thoughts of
38245. how things would be after his death, and how her new, liberated life
38246. would be ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward
38247. morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.
38248. 
38249. She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her
38250. clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father's illness. On waking
38251. she listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him
38252. groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.
38253. 
38254. "But what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!" she
38255. cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.
38256. 
38257. She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In
38258. front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed
38259. into the vehicles.
38260. 
38261. It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch, still
38262. horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts
38263. before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and went out to
38264. her.
38265. 
38266. "He is a little better today," said he. "I was looking for you. One can
38267. make out something of what he is saying. His head is clearer. Come in,
38268. he is asking for you..."
38269. 
38270. Princess Mary's heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale
38271. and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk to
38272. him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with
38273. those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.
38274. 
38275. "Come," said the doctor.
38276. 
38277. Princess Mary entered her father's room and went up to his bed. He was
38278. lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with
38279. their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed
38280. straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips
38281. motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His face
38282. seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown smaller.
38283. Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand pressed hers
38284. so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come. He
38285. twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.
38286. 
38287. She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When
38288. she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he
38289. calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips
38290. and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and
38291. imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.
38292. 
38293. Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic
38294. efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with
38295. difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said something,
38296. repeating the same words several times. She could not understand them,
38297. but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words
38298. he uttered.
38299. 
38300. "Mmm...ar...ate...ate..." he repeated several times.
38301. 
38302. It was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor thought
38303. he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: "Mary, are you afraid?"
38304. The prince shook his head, again repeated the same sounds.
38305. 
38306. "My mind, my mind aches?" questioned Princess Mary.
38307. 
38308. He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and
38309. began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find
38310. the right place for it.
38311. 
38312. "Always thoughts... about you... thoughts..." he then uttered much
38313. more clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being
38314. understood.
38315. 
38316. Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs
38317. and tears.
38318. 
38319. He moved his hand over her hair.
38320. 
38321. "I have been calling you all night..." he brought out.
38322. 
38323. "If only I had known..." she said through her tears. "I was afraid to
38324. come in."
38325. 
38326. He pressed her hand.
38327. 
38328. "Weren't you asleep?"
38329. 
38330. "No, I did not sleep," said Princess Mary, shaking her head.
38331. 
38332. Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as
38333. he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move
38334. with difficulty.
38335. 
38336. "Dear one... Dearest..." Princess Mary could not quite make out what he
38337. had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender
38338. caressing word such as he had never used to her before. "Why didn't you
38339. come in?"
38340. 
38341. "And I was wishing for his death!" thought Princess Mary.
38342. 
38343. He was silent awhile.
38344. 
38345. "Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... thank
38346. you!... forgive!... thank you!..." and tears began to flow from his
38347. eyes. "Call Andrew!" he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression
38348. of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.
38349. 
38350. He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it
38351. seemed to Princess Mary.
38352. 
38353. "I have a letter from him," she replied.
38354. 
38355. He glanced at her with timid surprise.
38356. 
38357. "Where is he?"
38358. 
38359. "He's with the army, Father, at Smolensk."
38360. 
38361. He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in
38362. answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and
38363. remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.
38364. 
38365. "Yes," he said, softly and distinctly. "Russia has perished. They've
38366. destroyed her."
38367. 
38368. And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. Princess Mary
38369. could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face.
38370. 
38371. Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and
38372. Tikhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.
38373. 
38374. Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could
38375. understand for a long time, till at last Tikhon understood and repeated
38376. it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in
38377. which he had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of Russia,
38378. or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and
38379. so she could not guess his words.
38380. 
38381. "Put on your white dress. I like it," was what he said.
38382. 
38383. Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor
38384. taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to
38385. persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the
38386. prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the
38387. Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and
38388. then he had a second and final stroke.
38389. 
38390. Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot and
38391. sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing,
38392. except passionate love for her father, love such as she thought she had
38393. never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as
38394. far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had
38395. planted.
38396. 
38397. "Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end
38398. quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me? What
38399. use will peace be when he is no longer here?" Princess Mary murmured,
38400. pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom
38401. which heaved with convulsive sobs.
38402. 
38403. When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her again
38404. to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne--who had remained at
38405. Bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it--coming toward her with a
38406. stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who
38407. had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her
38408. prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding him; she
38409. led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then,
38410. excusing herself, she went to the door of the old prince's room. The
38411. doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.
38412. 
38413. "Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!"
38414. 
38415. She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the
38416. slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how
38417. long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman's
38418. footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Dunyasha her maid,
38419. who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in
38420. alarm on seeing her mistress.
38421. 
38422. "Please come, Princess... The Prince," said Dunyasha in a breaking
38423. voice.
38424. 
38425. "Immediately, I'm coming, I'm coming!" replied the princess hurriedly,
38426. not giving Dunyasha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to
38427. avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.
38428. 
38429. "Princess, it's God's will! You must be prepared for everything," said
38430. the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.
38431. 
38432. "Let me alone; it's not true!" she cried angrily to him.
38433. 
38434. The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her
38435. father's door. "Why are these people with frightened faces stopping me?
38436. I don't want any of them! And what are they doing here?" she thought.
38437. She opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened
38438. room startled her. In the room were her nurse and other women. They all
38439. drew back from the bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the
38440. bed as before, but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess
38441. Mary stop short on the threshold.
38442. 
38443. "No, he's not dead--it's impossible!" she told herself and approached
38444. him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips
38445. to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force of the
38446. tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was
38447. replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her. "No, he
38448. is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and
38449. hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!" And hiding
38450. her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor,
38451. who held her up.
38452. 
38453. 
38454. In the presence of Tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had been
38455. the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should
38456. not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the
38457. legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform
38458. with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table.
38459. Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done
38460. as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his
38461. coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of
38462. juniper, a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head, and in a
38463. corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms.
38464. 
38465. Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the
38466. inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round
38467. the coffin--the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women--and all with
38468. fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old
38469. prince's cold and stiffened hand.
38470. 
38471. 
38472. 
38473. 
38474. 
38475. CHAPTER IX
38476. 
38477. 
38478. Until Prince Andrew settled in Bogucharovo its owners had always been
38479. absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character from
38480. those of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress, and
38481. disposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used to
38482. approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to Bald Hills
38483. to help with the harvest or to dig ponds, and ditches, but he disliked
38484. them for their boorishness.
38485. 
38486. Prince Andrew's last stay at Bogucharovo, when he introduced hospitals
38487. and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, had not
38488. softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in
38489. them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness. Various
38490. obscure rumors were always current among them: at one time a rumor that
38491. they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to
38492. which they were all to be converted; then of some proclamation of the
38493. Tsar's and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which
38494. it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had
38495. stopped it), then of Peter Fedorovich's return to the throne in seven
38496. years' time, when everything would be made free and so "simple" that
38497. there would be no restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and
38498. his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague
38499. notions of Antichrist, the end of the world, and "pure freedom."
38500. 
38501. In the vicinity of Bogucharovo were large villages belonging to the
38502. crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they
38503. pleased. There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood
38504. and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the
38505. peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of
38506. the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to
38507. contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among
38508. others. One instance, which had occurred some twenty years before, was
38509. a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown "warm rivers."
38510. Hundreds of peasants, among them the Bogucharovo folk, suddenly began
38511. selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast.
38512. As birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their
38513. wives and children streamed to the southeast, to parts where none of
38514. them had ever been. They set off in caravans, bought their freedom one
38515. by one or ran away, and drove or walked toward the "warm rivers." Many
38516. of them were punished, some sent to Siberia, many died of cold and
38517. hunger on the road, many returned of their own accord, and the movement
38518. died down of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason.
38519. But such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new
38520. forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and
38521. at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone
38522. living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these
38523. undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.
38524. 
38525. Alpatych, who had reached Bogucharovo shortly before the old prince's
38526. death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to
38527. what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of
38528. forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages
38529. to be devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region
38530. round Bogucharovo were, it was rumored, in touch with the French,
38531. received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not
38532. migrate. He learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant
38533. Karp, who possessed great influence in the village commune and had
38534. recently been away driving a government transport, had returned with
38535. news that the Cossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the
38536. French did not harm them. Alpatych also knew that on the previous day
38537. another peasant had even brought from the village of Visloukhovo, which
38538. was occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no
38539. harm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would
38540. be paid for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had
38541. brought from Visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that
38542. they were false) paid to him in advance for hay.
38543. 
38544. More important still, Alpatych learned that on the morning of the
38545. very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the
38546. princess' luggage from Bogucharovo, there had been a village meeting at
38547. which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no
38548. time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old prince's death,
38549. the Marshal had insisted on Princess Mary's leaving at once, as it was
38550. becoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he could
38551. not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of the day the
38552. old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return next day for
38553. the funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he received tidings that
38554. the French had unexpectedly advanced, and had barely time to remove his
38555. own family and valuables from his estate.
38556. 
38557. For some thirty years Bogucharovo had been managed by the village Elder,
38558. Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive "Dronushka."
38559. 
38560. Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow
38561. big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they
38562. are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as
38563. straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.
38564. 
38565. Soon after the migration to the "warm rivers," in which he had taken
38566. part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of
38567. Bogucharovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for
38568. twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their
38569. master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the steward
38570. respected him and jestingly called him "the Minister." During the
38571. whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill, never after
38572. sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue,
38573. and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money
38574. account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless
38575. cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of the whole corn
38576. crop on any single acre of the Bogucharovo fields.
38577. 
38578. Alpatych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his
38579. Dron on the day of the prince's funeral and told him to have twelve
38580. horses got ready for the princess' carriages and eighteen carts for
38581. the things to be removed from Bogucharovo. Though the peasants paid
38582. quitrent, Alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about complying
38583. with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty households at
38584. work in Bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do. But on hearing the
38585. order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent. Alpatych named certain
38586. peasants he knew, from whom he told him to take the carts.
38587. 
38588. Dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting.
38589. Alpatych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no horses
38590. available: some horses were carting for the government, others were too
38591. weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It seemed that no horses
38592. could be had even for the carriages, much less for the carting.
38593. 
38594. Alpatych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a model
38595. village Elder, so Alpatych had not managed the prince's estates for
38596. twenty years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in the highest
38597. degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt
38598. with. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did
38599. not express his personal views but the general mood of the Bogucharovo
38600. commune, by which the Elder had already been carried away. But he also
38601. knew that Dron, who had acquired property and was hated by the commune,
38602. must be hesitating between the two camps: the masters' and the serfs'.
38603. He noticed this hesitation in Dron's look and therefore frowned and
38604. moved closer up to him.
38605. 
38606. "Now just listen, Dronushka," said he. "Don't talk nonsense to me. His
38607. excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people
38608. away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order from the
38609. Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you
38610. hear?"
38611. 
38612. "I hear," Dron answered without lifting his eyes.
38613. 
38614. Alpatych was not satisfied with this reply.
38615. 
38616. "Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!" he said, shaking his head.
38617. 
38618. "The power is in your hands," Dron rejoined sadly.
38619. 
38620. "Eh, Dron, drop it!" Alpatych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his
38621. bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron's feet. "I can see
38622. through you and three yards into the ground under you," he continued,
38623. gazing at the floor in front of Dron.
38624. 
38625. Dron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpatych and again lowered
38626. his eyes.
38627. 
38628. "You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their
38629. homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning
38630. for the princess' things. And don't go to any meeting yourself, do you
38631. hear?"
38632. 
38633. Dron suddenly fell on his knees.
38634. 
38635. "Yakov Alpatych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge me,
38636. for Christ's sake!"
38637. 
38638. "Stop that!" cried Alpatych sternly. "I see through you and three yards
38639. under you," he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his
38640. knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had
38641. been able to retain the old prince's favor for twenty years had long
38642. since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of
38643. seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.
38644. 
38645. Dron got up and was about to say something, but Alpatych interrupted
38646. him.
38647. 
38648. "What is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you thinking
38649. of, eh?"
38650. 
38651. "What am I to do with the people?" said Dron. "They're quite beside
38652. themselves; I have already told them..."
38653. 
38654. "'Told them,' I dare say!" said Alpatych. "Are they drinking?" he asked
38655. abruptly.
38656. 
38657. "Quite beside themselves, Yakov Alpatych; they've fetched another
38658. barrel."
38659. 
38660. "Well, then, listen! I'll go to the police officer, and you tell them
38661. so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready."
38662. 
38663. "I understand."
38664. 
38665. Alpatych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time
38666. and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion
38667. that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive "I understand"
38668. from Dron, Alpatych contented himself with that, though he not only
38669. doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the
38670. carts would not be forthcoming.
38671. 
38672. And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the
38673. village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which
38674. decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the
38675. carts should not be provided. Without saying anything of this to the
38676. princess, Alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which
38677. had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for
38678. the princess' carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police
38679. authorities.
38680. 
38681. 
38682. 
38683. 
38684. 
38685. CHAPTER X
38686. 
38687. 
38688. After her father's funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and
38689. did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alpatych was
38690. asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with
38691. Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been
38692. lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go
38693. away and begged to be left in peace.
38694. 
38695. The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She
38696. lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the
38697. leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused
38698. thoughts were centered on one subject--the irrevocability of death and
38699. her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had
38700. shown itself during her father's illness. She wished to pray but did not
38701. dare to, dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God.
38702. She lay for a long time in that position.
38703. 
38704. The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays
38705. shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco
38706. cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts
38707. suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up,
38708. and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the
38709. clear but windy evening.
38710. 
38711. "Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will
38712. hinder you," she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her
38713. head fall on the window sill.
38714. 
38715. Someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and
38716. kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black
38717. dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed
38718. her, and immediately began to cry. The princess looked up at her. All
38719. their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind.
38720. But she remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle
38721. Bourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were
38722. the reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. "Besides,
38723. is it for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?" she
38724. thought.
38725. 
38726. Princess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of Mademoiselle
38727. Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but who yet was
38728. dependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry for her
38729. and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle
38730. Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand, speaking of
38731. the princess' sorrow and making herself a partner in it. She said her
38732. only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her
38733. sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but
38734. this great grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone,
38735. and that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude. The princess
38736. heard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and
38737. listening to the sound of her voice.
38738. 
38739. "Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess," said Mademoiselle
38740. Bourienne after a pause. "I understand that you could not, and cannot,
38741. think of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has
38742. Alpatych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?" she asked.
38743. 
38744. Princess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go or
38745. where to. "Is it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it not
38746. all the same?" she thought, and did not reply.
38747. 
38748. "You know, chere Marie," said Mademoiselle Bourienne, "that we are in
38749. danger--are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move now.
38750. If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows..."
38751. 
38752. Princess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was
38753. talking about.
38754. 
38755. "Oh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now," she said.
38756. "Of course I would on no account wish to go away from him.... Alpatych
38757. did say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do nothing,
38758. nothing, and don't want to...."
38759. 
38760. "I've spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow,
38761. but I think it would now be better to stay here," said Mademoiselle
38762. Bourienne. "Because, you will agree, chere Marie, to fall into the hands
38763. of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible."
38764. 
38765. Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not
38766. printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau's, telling people
38767. not to leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford
38768. them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.
38769. 
38770. "I think it would be best to appeal to that general," she continued,
38771. "and I am sure that all due respect would be shown you."
38772. 
38773. Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled
38774. sobs.
38775. 
38776. "From whom did you get this?" she asked.
38777. 
38778. "They probably recognized that I am French, by my name," replied
38779. Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.
38780. 
38781. Princess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and with
38782. a pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince Andrew's
38783. study.
38784. 
38785. "Dunyasha, send Alpatych, or Dronushka, or somebody to me!" she said,
38786. "and tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me," she added, hearing
38787. Mademoiselle Bourienne's voice. "We must go at once, at once!" she said,
38788. appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.
38789. 
38790. "If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French! That
38791. I, the daughter of Prince Nicholas Bolkonski, asked General Rameau for
38792. protection and accepted his favor!" This idea horrified her, made her
38793. shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never
38794. experienced before. All that was distressing, and especially all that
38795. was humiliating, in her position rose vividly to her mind. "They, the
38796. French, would settle in this house: M. le General Rameau would occupy
38797. Prince Andrew's study and amuse himself by looking through and reading
38798. his letters and papers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of
38799. Bogucharovo for him. I should be given a small room as a favor, the
38800. soldiers would violate my father's newly dug grave to steal his crosses
38801. and stars, they would tell me of their victories over the Russians, and
38802. would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow..." thought Princess Mary,
38803. not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father
38804. and her brother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what
38805. happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead
38806. father and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts
38807. and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what they would
38808. have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into Prince Andrew's
38809. study, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her
38810. position.
38811. 
38812. The demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her father's
38813. death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force
38814. and took possession of her.
38815. 
38816. Agitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael
38817. Ivanovich and now for Tikhon or Dron. Dunyasha, the nurse, and the other
38818. maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne's statement was
38819. correct. Alpatych was not at home, he had gone to the police. Neither
38820. could the architect Michael Ivanovich, who on being sent for came in
38821. with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With just the same smile
38822. of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to
38823. answer the old prince without expressing views of his own, he now
38824. replied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his
38825. answers. The old valet Tikhon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the
38826. stamp of inconsolable grief, replied: "Yes, Princess" to all Princess
38827. Mary's questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.
38828. 
38829. At length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a deep bow
38830. to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.
38831. 
38832. Princess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him.
38833. 
38834. "Dronushka," she said, regarding as a sure friend this Dronushka who
38835. always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the
38836. fair at Vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her, "Dronushka, now
38837. since our misfortune..." she began, but could not go on.
38838. 
38839. "We are all in God's hands," said he, with a sigh.
38840. 
38841. They were silent for a while.
38842. 
38843. "Dronushka, Alpatych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn
38844. to. Is it true, as they tell me, that I can't even go away?"
38845. 
38846. "Why shouldn't you go away, your excellency? You can go," said Dron.
38847. 
38848. "I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I
38849. can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go away
38850. tonight or early tomorrow morning."
38851. 
38852. Dron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: "There are no
38853. horses; I told Yakov Alpatych so."
38854. 
38855. "Why are there none?" asked the princess.
38856. 
38857. "It's all God's scourge," said Dron. "What horses we had have been
38858. taken for the army or have died--this is such a year! It's not a case of
38859. feeding horses--we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go three
38860. days without eating. We've nothing, we've been ruined."
38861. 
38862. Princess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.
38863. 
38864. "The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?" she asked.
38865. 
38866. "They're dying of hunger," said Dron. "It's not a case of carting."
38867. 
38868. "But why didn't you tell me, Dronushka? Isn't it possible to help them?
38869. I'll do all I can...."
38870. 
38871. To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow
38872. was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich
38873. could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there
38874. was such a thing as "landlord's corn" which was sometimes given to the
38875. peasants. She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would
38876. refuse to help the peasants in need, she only feared to make some
38877. mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to
38878. give. She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her
38879. without scruple to forget her own grief. She began asking Dron about the
38880. peasants' needs and what there was in Bogucharovo that belonged to the
38881. landlord.
38882. 
38883. "But we have grain belonging to my brother?" she said.
38884. 
38885. "The landlord's grain is all safe," replied Dron proudly. "Our prince
38886. did not order it to be sold."
38887. 
38888. "Give it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave
38889. in my brother's name," said she.
38890. 
38891. Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.
38892. 
38893. "Give them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all. I
38894. give this order in my brother's name; and tell them that what is ours is
38895. theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so."
38896. 
38897. Dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.
38898. 
38899. "Discharge me, little mother, for God's sake! Order the keys to be taken
38900. from me," said he. "I have served twenty-three years and have done no
38901. wrong. Discharge me, for God's sake!"
38902. 
38903. Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was
38904. asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his
38905. devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the
38906. peasants.
38907. 
38908. 
38909. 
38910. 
38911. 
38912. CHAPTER XI
38913. 
38914. 
38915. An hour later Dunyasha came to tell the princess that Dron had come, and
38916. all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess' order and
38917. wished to have word with their mistress.
38918. 
38919. "But I never told them to come," said Princess Mary. "I only told Dron
38920. to let them have the grain."
38921. 
38922. "Only, for God's sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and don't go
38923. out to them. It's all a trick," said Dunyasha, "and when Yakov Alpatych
38924. returns let us get away... and please don't..."
38925. 
38926. "What is a trick?" asked Princess Mary in surprise.
38927. 
38928. "I know it is, only listen to me for God's sake! Ask nurse too. They say
38929. they don't agree to leave Bogucharovo as you ordered."
38930. 
38931. "You're making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away," said
38932. Princess Mary. "Call Dronushka."
38933. 
38934. Dron came and confirmed Dunyasha's words; the peasants had come by the
38935. princess' order.
38936. 
38937. "But I never sent for them," declared the princess. "You must have given
38938. my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain."
38939. 
38940. Dron only sighed in reply.
38941. 
38942. "If you order it they will go away," said he.
38943. 
38944. "No, no. I'll go out to them," said Princess Mary, and in spite of
38945. the nurse's and Dunyasha's protests she went out into the porch; Dron,
38946. Dunyasha, the nurse, and Michael Ivanovich following her.
38947. 
38948. "They probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to
38949. remain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the
38950. French," thought Princess Mary. "I will offer them monthly rations and
38951. housing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in
38952. my place," she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd
38953. standing on the pasture by the barn.
38954. 
38955. The men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their
38956. hats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt, came
38957. close up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were fixed
38958. on her, and there were so many different faces, that she could not
38959. distinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them all
38960. at once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she
38961. represented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she boldly
38962. began her speech.
38963. 
38964. "I am very glad you have come," she said without raising her eyes, and
38965. feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. "Dronushka tells me
38966. that the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune, and I
38967. shall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because it
38968. is dangerous here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving you
38969. everything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all our grain,
38970. so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been told that I
38971. am giving you the grain to keep you here--that is not true. On the
38972. contrary, I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near
38973. Moscow, and I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for
38974. nothing. You shall be given food and lodging."
38975. 
38976. The princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.
38977. 
38978. "I am not doing this on my own account," she continued, "I do it in the
38979. name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my brother
38980. and his son."
38981. 
38982. Again she paused. No one broke the silence.
38983. 
38984. "Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that is
38985. mine is yours," she concluded, scanning the faces before her.
38986. 
38987. All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She
38988. could not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or
38989. apprehension and distrust--but the expression on all the faces was
38990. identical.
38991. 
38992. "We are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won't do for us to
38993. take the landlord's grain," said a voice at the back of the crowd.
38994. 
38995. "But why not?" asked the princess.
38996. 
38997. No one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd, found that
38998. every eye she met now was immediately dropped.
38999. 
39000. "But why don't you want to take it?" she asked again.
39001. 
39002. No one answered.
39003. 
39004. The silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch
39005. someone's eye.
39006. 
39007. "Why don't you speak?" she inquired of a very old man who stood just
39008. in front of her leaning on his stick. "If you think something more is
39009. wanted, tell me! I will do anything," said she, catching his eye.
39010. 
39011. But as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:
39012. 
39013. "Why should we agree? We don't want the grain."
39014. 
39015. "Why should we give up everything? We don't agree. Don't agree.... We
39016. are sorry for you, but we're not willing. Go away yourself, alone..."
39017. came from various sides of the crowd.
39018. 
39019. And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression,
39020. though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude,
39021. but of angry resolve.
39022. 
39023. "But you can't have understood me," said Princess Mary with a sad smile.
39024. "Why don't you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while here
39025. the enemy would ruin you..."
39026. 
39027. But her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.
39028. 
39029. "We're not willing. Let them ruin us! We won't take your grain. We don't
39030. agree."
39031. 
39032. Again Princess Mary tried to catch someone's eye, but not a single eye
39033. in the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying to avoid
39034. her look. She felt strange and awkward.
39035. 
39036. "Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses
39037. and go into bondage! I dare say! 'I'll give you grain, indeed!' she
39038. says," voices in the crowd were heard saying.
39039. 
39040. With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the
39041. house. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her
39042. departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone with her
39043. own thoughts.
39044. 
39045. 
39046. 
39047. 
39048. 
39049. CHAPTER XII
39050. 
39051. 
39052. For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her
39053. room hearing the sound of the peasants' voices that reached her from
39054. the village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt that she
39055. could not understand them however much she might think about them. She
39056. thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused
39057. by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to the past. Now she
39058. could remember it and weep or pray.
39059. 
39060. After sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh. Toward
39061. midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon began
39062. to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to
39063. rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.
39064. 
39065. Pictures of the near past--her father's illness and last moments--rose
39066. one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered
39067. over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the
39068. picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in
39069. imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these pictures
39070. presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they
39071. seemed now present, now past, and now future.
39072. 
39073. She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was
39074. being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills,
39075. muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray
39076. eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.
39077. 
39078. "Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died," she
39079. thought. "He had always thought what he said then." And she recalled in
39080. all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke,
39081. when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his
39082. will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going
39083. to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened
39084. at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to
39085. Tikhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress.
39086. Evidently he had wanted to talk. "And why didn't he call me? Why didn't
39087. he let me be there instead of Tikhon?" Princess Mary had thought and
39088. thought again now. "Now he will never tell anyone what he had in his
39089. soul. Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have
39090. said all he longed to say, and not Tikhon but I might have heard and
39091. understood him. Why didn't I enter the room?" she thought. "Perhaps he
39092. would then have said to me what he said the day he died. While talking
39093. to Tikhon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was
39094. standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful for him
39095. to talk to Tikhon who did not understand him. I remember how he began
39096. speaking to him about Lise as if she were alive--he had forgotten she
39097. was dead--and Tikhon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted,
39098. 'Fool!' He was greatly depressed. From behind the door I heard how he
39099. lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed, 'My God!' Why didn't
39100. I go in then? What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And
39101. perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word
39102. to me." And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said
39103. to her on the day of his death. "Dear-est!" she repeated, and began
39104. sobbing, with tears that relieved her soul. She now saw his face before
39105. her. And not the face she had known ever since she could remember and
39106. had always seen at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen
39107. for the first time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details,
39108. when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.
39109. 
39110. "Dear-est!" she repeated again.
39111. 
39112. "What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking
39113. now?" This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she
39114. saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay
39115. in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief. And the
39116. horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself
39117. that that was not he, but something mysterious and horrible, seized her
39118. again. She tried to think of something else and to pray, but could do
39119. neither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows,
39120. expecting every moment to see his dead face, and she felt that the
39121. silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast.
39122. 
39123. "Dunyasha," she whispered. "Dunyasha!" she screamed wildly, and tearing
39124. herself out of this silence she ran to the servants' quarters to meet
39125. her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her.
39126. 
39127. 
39128. 
39129. 
39130. 
39131. CHAPTER XIII
39132. 
39133. 
39134. On the seventeenth of August Rostov and Ilyin, accompanied by Lavrushka
39135. who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly, left
39136. their quarters at Yankovo, ten miles from Bogucharovo, and went for a
39137. ride--to try a new horse Ilyin had bought and to find out whether there
39138. was any hay to be had in the villages.
39139. 
39140. For the last three days Bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile
39141. armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as
39142. for the French vanguard; Rostov, as a careful squadron commander, wished
39143. to take such provisions as remained at Bogucharovo before the French
39144. could get them.
39145. 
39146. Rostov and Ilyin were in the merriest of moods. On the way to
39147. Bogucharovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where
39148. they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned
39149. Lavrushka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one
39150. another to try Ilyin's horse.
39151. 
39152. Rostov had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of
39153. that very Bolkonski who had been engaged to his sister.
39154. 
39155. Rostov and Ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the
39156. incline before reaching Bogucharovo, and Rostov, outstripping Ilyin, was
39157. the first to gallop into the village street.
39158. 
39159. "You're first!" cried Ilyin, flushed.
39160. 
39161. "Yes, always first both on the grassland and here," answered Rostov,
39162. stroking his heated Donets horse.
39163. 
39164. "And I'd have won on my Frenchy, your excellency," said Lavrushka
39165. from behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, "only I didn't wish to
39166. mortify you."
39167. 
39168. They rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants was
39169. standing.
39170. 
39171. Some of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals
39172. without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces
39173. and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and
39174. singing some incoherent song, and approached the officers.
39175. 
39176. "Fine fellows!" said Rostov laughing. "Is there any hay here?"
39177. 
39178. "And how like one another," said Ilyin.
39179. 
39180. "A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!" sang one of the peasants with a
39181. blissful smile.
39182. 
39183. One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostov.
39184. 
39185. "Who do you belong to?" he asked.
39186. 
39187. "The French," replied Ilyin jestingly, "and here is Napoleon
39188. himself"--and he pointed to Lavrushka.
39189. 
39190. "Then you are Russians?" the peasant asked again.
39191. 
39192. "And is there a large force of you here?" said another, a short man,
39193. coming up.
39194. 
39195. "Very large," answered Rostov. "But why have you collected here?" he
39196. added. "Is it a holiday?"
39197. 
39198. "The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune," replied
39199. the peasant, moving away.
39200. 
39201. At that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a
39202. man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.
39203. 
39204. "The one in pink is mine, so keep off!" said Ilyin on seeing Dunyasha
39205. running resolutely toward him.
39206. 
39207. "She'll be ours!" said Lavrushka to Ilyin, winking.
39208. 
39209. "What do you want, my pretty?" said Ilyin with a smile.
39210. 
39211. "The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name."
39212. 
39213. "This is Count Rostov, squadron commander, and I am your humble
39214. servant."
39215. 
39216. "Co-o-om-pa-ny!" roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as
39217. he looked at Ilyin talking to the girl. Following Dunyasha, Alpatych
39218. advanced to Rostov, having bared his head while still at a distance.
39219. 
39220. "May I make bold to trouble your honor?" said he respectfully, but with
39221. a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand
39222. thrust into his bosom. "My mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince
39223. Nicholas Bolkonski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding
39224. herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people"--he
39225. pointed to the peasants--"asks you to come up to the house.... Won't
39226. you, please, ride on a little farther," said Alpatych with a melancholy
39227. smile, "as it is not convenient in the presence of...?" He pointed to
39228. the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse.
39229. 
39230. "Ah!... Alpatych... Ah, Yakov Alpatych... Grand! Forgive us for Christ's
39231. sake, eh?" said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.
39232. 
39233. Rostov looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.
39234. 
39235. "Or perhaps they amuse your honor?" remarked Alpatych with a staid air,
39236. as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.
39237. 
39238. "No, there's not much to be amused at here," said Rostov, and rode on a
39239. little way. "What's the matter?" he asked.
39240. 
39241. "I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don't
39242. wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her
39243. horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her
39244. excellency cannot get away."
39245. 
39246. "Impossible!" exclaimed Rostov.
39247. 
39248. "I have the honor to report to you the actual truth," said Alpatych.
39249. 
39250. Rostov dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alpatych
39251. to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared
39252. that the princess' offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and
39253. her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect
39254. that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had
39255. not appeared when Alpatych sent for him; and that in the morning when
39256. the princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had
39257. come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let
39258. her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that
39259. they would unharness the horses. Alpatych had gone out to admonish them,
39260. but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing
39261. himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that
39262. there was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would
39263. serve her as before and obey her in everything.
39264. 
39265. At the moment when Rostov and Ilyin were galloping along the road,
39266. Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpatych, her nurse, and the
39267. maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the
39268. cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran
39269. away, and the women in the house began to wail.
39270. 
39271. "Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!" exclaimed deeply moved voices as
39272. Rostov passed through the anteroom.
39273. 
39274. Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting
39275. room, when Rostov was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and why
39276. he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian
39277. face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a
39278. man of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and
39279. began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This
39280. meeting immediately struck Rostov as a romantic event. "A helpless girl
39281. overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants!
39282. And what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there
39283. are in her features and expression!" thought he as he looked at her and
39284. listened to her timid story.
39285. 
39286. When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her
39287. father's funeral, her voiced trembled. She turned away, and then, as if
39288. fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at
39289. him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in Rostov's
39290. eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that
39291. radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.
39292. 
39293. "I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here
39294. and am able to show my readiness to serve you," said Rostov, rising. "Go
39295. when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare
39296. to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort."
39297. And bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward
39298. the door.
39299. 
39300. Rostov's deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would
39301. consider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to
39302. take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.
39303. 
39304. Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.
39305. 
39306. "I am very, very grateful to you," she said in French, "but I hope it
39307. was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it." She
39308. suddenly began to cry.
39309. 
39310. "Excuse me!" she said.
39311. 
39312. Rostov, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.
39313. 
39314. 
39315. 
39316. 
39317. 
39318. CHAPTER XIV
39319. 
39320. 
39321. "Well, is she pretty? Ah, friend--my pink one is delicious; her name is
39322. Dunyasha...."
39323. 
39324. But on glancing at Rostov's face Ilyin stopped short. He saw that his
39325. hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought.
39326. 
39327. Rostov glanced angrily at Ilyin and without replying strode off with
39328. rapid steps to the village.
39329. 
39330. "I'll show them; I'll give it to them, the brigands!" said he to
39331. himself.
39332. 
39333. Alpatych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with
39334. him with difficulty.
39335. 
39336. "What decision have you been pleased to come to?" said he.
39337. 
39338. Rostov stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on
39339. Alpatych.
39340. 
39341. "Decision? What decision? Old dotard!..." cried he. "What have you been
39342. about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can't manage them? You're
39343. a traitor yourself! I know you. I'll flay you all alive!..." And as if
39344. afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alpatych and went rapidly
39345. forward. Alpatych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with
39346. Rostov at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said
39347. the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be
39348. imprudent to "overresist" them without an armed force, and would it not
39349. be better first to send for the military?
39350. 
39351. "I'll give them armed force... I'll 'overresist' them!" uttered Rostov
39352. meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to
39353. vent it.
39354. 
39355. Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick,
39356. resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the more
39357. Alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results.
39358. The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw
39359. Rostov's rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.
39360. 
39361. After the hussars had come to the village and Rostov had gone to see the
39362. princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd.
39363. Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and
39364. might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained. Dron was of
39365. this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked
39366. their ex-Elder.
39367. 
39368. "How many years have you been fattening on the commune?" Karp shouted at
39369. him. "It's all one to you! You'll dig up your pot of money and take
39370. it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are
39371. ruined or not?"
39372. 
39373. "We've been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their homes
39374. or take away a single grain, and that's all about it!" cried another.
39375. 
39376. "It was your son's turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged
39377. your lump of a son," a little old man suddenly began attacking
39378. Dron--"and so they took my Vanka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all
39379. have to die."
39380. 
39381. "To be sure, we all have to die. I'm not against the commune," said
39382. Dron.
39383. 
39384. "That's it--not against it! You've filled your belly...."
39385. 
39386. The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostov, followed by
39387. Ilyin, Lavrushka, and Alpatych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrusting
39388. his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to the front.
39389. Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer
39390. together.
39391. 
39392. "Who is your Elder here? Hey?" shouted Rostov, coming up to the crowd
39393. with quick steps.
39394. 
39395. "The Elder? What do you want with him?..." asked Karp.
39396. 
39397. But before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off and a
39398. fierce blow jerked his head to one side.
39399. 
39400. "Caps off, traitors!" shouted Rostov in a wrathful voice. "Where's the
39401. Elder?" he cried furiously.
39402. 
39403. "The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakharych, you!" meek and
39404. flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to
39405. come off their heads.
39406. 
39407. "We don't riot, we're following the orders," declared Karp, and at that
39408. moment several voices began speaking together.
39409. 
39410. "It's as the old men have decided--there's too many of you giving
39411. orders."
39412. 
39413. "Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!" cried Rostov unmeaningly in a
39414. voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. "Bind him, bind him!" he
39415. shouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavrushka and Alpatych.
39416. 
39417. Lavrushka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from
39418. behind.
39419. 
39420. "Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?" he called out.
39421. 
39422. Alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come
39423. and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking
39424. off their belts.
39425. 
39426. "Where's the Elder?" demanded Rostov in a loud voice.
39427. 
39428. With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.
39429. 
39430. "Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrushka!" shouted Rostov, as if that
39431. order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.
39432. 
39433. And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own
39434. belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.
39435. 
39436. "And you all listen to me!" said Rostov to the peasants. "Be off to your
39437. houses at once, and don't let one of your voices be heard!"
39438. 
39439. "Why, we've not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness. It's
39440. all nonsense... I said then that it was not in order," voices were heard
39441. bickering with one another.
39442. 
39443. "There! What did I say?" said Alpatych, coming into his own again. "It's
39444. wrong, lads!"
39445. 
39446.  "All our stupidity, Yakov Alpatych," came the answers, and the
39447. crowd began at once to disperse through the village.
39448. 
39449. The two bound men were led off to the master's house. The two drunken
39450. peasants followed them.
39451. 
39452. "Aye, when I look at you!..." said one of them to Karp.
39453. 
39454. "How can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of,
39455. you fool?" added the other--"A real fool!"
39456. 
39457. Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the
39458. Bogucharovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the
39459. proprietor's goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron, liberated at
39460. Princess Mary's wish from the cupboard where he had been confined, was
39461. standing in the yard directing the men.
39462. 
39463. "Don't put it in so carelessly," said one of the peasants, a man with a
39464. round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. "You know it has
39465. cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord
39466. where it'll get rubbed? I don't like that way of doing things. Let it
39467. all be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put it under the
39468. bast matting and cover it with hay--that's the way!"
39469. 
39470. "Eh, books, books!" said another peasant, bringing out Prince Andrew's
39471. library cupboards. "Don't catch up against it! It's heavy, lads--solid
39472. books."
39473. 
39474. "Yes, they worked all day and didn't play!" remarked the tall,
39475. round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the
39476. dictionaries that were on the top.
39477. 
39478. 
39479. Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostov did not go back to
39480. the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure. When her
39481. carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight
39482. miles from Bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops. At
39483. the inn at Yankovo he respectfully took leave of her, for the first time
39484. permitting himself to kiss her hand.
39485. 
39486. "How can you speak so!" he blushingly replied to Princess Mary's
39487. expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had
39488. occurred. "Any police officer would have done as much! If we had had
39489. only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,"
39490. said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. "I
39491. am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.
39492. Good-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet
39493. you again in happier circumstances. If you don't want to make me blush,
39494. please don't thank me!"
39495. 
39496. But the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked
39497. him with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and
39498. tenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him
39499. for. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been
39500. there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the
39501. French, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger
39502. to save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and
39503. noble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His kind,
39504. honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to
39505. cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.
39506. 
39507. When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt
39508. her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange
39509. question presented itself to her: did she love him?
39510. 
39511. On the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess' position was not
39512. a cheerful one, Dunyasha, who went with her in the carriage, more than
39513. once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at
39514. something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.
39515. 
39516. "Well, supposing I do love him?" thought Princess Mary.
39517. 
39518. Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in
39519. love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted herself
39520. with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not
39521. be to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she continued to
39522. the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for
39523. the first and last time in her life.
39524. 
39525. Sometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his words,
39526. happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those moments that
39527. Dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window.
39528. 
39529. "Was it not fate that brought him to Bogucharovo, and at that very
39530. moment?" thought Princess Mary. "And that caused his sister to refuse my
39531. brother?" And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence.
39532. 
39533. The impression the princess made on Rostov was a very agreeable one. To
39534. remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of his
39535. adventure at Bogucharovo, rallied him on having gone to look for hay
39536. and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew
39537. angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle
39538. Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune,
39539. had against his will more than once entered his head. For himself
39540. personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her
39541. he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his
39542. father's affairs in order, and would even--he felt it--ensure Princess
39543. Mary's happiness.
39544. 
39545. But Sonya? And his plighted word? That was why Rostov grew angry when he
39546. was rallied about Princess Bolkonskaya.
39547. 
39548. 
39549. 
39550. 
39551. 
39552. CHAPTER XV
39553. 
39554. 
39555. On receiving command of the armies Kutuzov remembered Prince Andrew and
39556. sent an order for him to report at headquarters.
39557. 
39558. Prince Andrew arrived at Tsarevo-Zaymishche on the very day and at the
39559. very hour that Kutuzov was reviewing the troops for the first time. He
39560. stopped in the village at the priest's house in front of which stood the
39561. commander in chief's carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate
39562. awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called Kutuzov. From the
39563. field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the
39564. roar of many voices shouting "Hurrah!" to the new commander in chief.
39565. Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces
39566. from Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kutuzov's absence and of the
39567. fine weather. A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick
39568. mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince
39569. Andrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and
39570. whether he would soon be back.
39571. 
39572. Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness' staff
39573. but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart
39574. orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in
39575. chief's orderly speaks to officers, replied:
39576. 
39577. "What? His Serene Highness? I expect he'll be here soon. What do you
39578. want?"
39579. 
39580. The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the
39581. orderly's tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and
39582. approached Bolkonski with a slight bow. Bolkonski made room for him on
39583. the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.
39584. 
39585. "You're also waiting for the commander in chief?" said he. "They say he
39586. weceives evewyone, thank God!... It's awful with those sausage eaters!
39587. Ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now p'waps
39588. Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what was
39589. happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in the
39590. campaign?" he asked.
39591. 
39592. "I had the pleasure," replied Prince Andrew, "not only of taking part
39593. in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear--not to
39594. mention the estate and home of my birth--my father, who died of grief. I
39595. belong to the province of Smolensk."
39596. 
39597. "Ah? You're Pwince Bolkonski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance! I'm
39598. Lieutenant Colonel Denisov, better known as 'Vaska,'" said Denisov,
39599. pressing Prince Andrew's hand and looking into his face with a
39600. particularly kindly attention. "Yes, I heard," said he sympathetically,
39601. and after a short pause added: "Yes, it's Scythian warfare. It's all
39602. vewy well--only not for those who get it in the neck. So you are Pwince
39603. Andwew Bolkonski?" He swayed his head. "Vewy pleased, Pwince, to make
39604. your acquaintance!" he repeated again, smiling sadly, and he again
39605. pressed Prince Andrew's hand.
39606. 
39607. Prince Andrew knew Denisov from what Natasha had told him of her first
39608. suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful
39609. feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which still found
39610. place in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and very serious
39611. impressions--such as the retreat from Smolensk, his visit to Bald Hills,
39612. and the recent news of his father's death--and had experienced so many
39613. emotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered his
39614. mind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their
39615. former strength. For Denisov, too, the memories awakened by the name of
39616. Bolkonski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper and
39617. after Natasha's singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen
39618. without realizing what he was doing. He smiled at the recollection of
39619. that time and of his love for Natasha, and passed at once to what now
39620. interested him passionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign
39621. he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had
39622. proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it
39623. to Kutuzov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line
39624. of operation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or
39625. concurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the French,
39626. we should attack their line of communication. He began explaining his
39627. plan to Prince Andrew.
39628. 
39629. "They can't hold all that line. It's impossible. I will undertake to
39630. bweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line,
39631. that's certain! There's only one way--guewilla warfare!"
39632. 
39633. Denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to
39634. Bolkonski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the
39635. army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with music
39636. and songs and coming from the field where the review was held. Sounds of
39637. hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.
39638. 
39639. "He's coming! He's coming!" shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.
39640. 
39641. Bolkonski and Denisov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers
39642. (a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kutuzov coming down the
39643. street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals
39644. rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of
39645. officers ran after and around them shouting, "Hurrah!"
39646. 
39647. His adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kutuzov was impatiently
39648. urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he
39649. raised his hand to his white Horse Guard's cap with a red band and no
39650. peak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to the guard of
39651. honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were
39652. giving him the salute, he looked at them silently and attentively for
39653. nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to
39654. the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face
39655. assumed a subtle expression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of
39656. perplexity.
39657. 
39658. "And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,
39659. General," he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and
39660. Denisov.
39661. 
39662. "Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" shouted those behind him.
39663. 
39664. Since Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutuzov had grown still more
39665. corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the
39666. familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was wearing
39667. the white Horse Guard's cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging
39668. over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and swayed limply on
39669. his brisk little horse.
39670. 
39671. "Whew... whew... whew!" he whistled just audibly as he rode into the
39672. yard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who
39673. means to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the stirrup
39674. and, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the
39675. effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned on his knee,
39676. groaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants
39677. who stood ready to assist him.
39678. 
39679. He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced
39680. at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his
39681. waddling gait to the porch. "Whew... whew... whew!" he whistled, and
39682. again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was
39683. only after some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrew's
39684. face linked itself up with Kutuzov's remembrance of his personality.
39685. 
39686. "Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come
39687. along..." said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the porch
39688. which creaked under his weight.
39689. 
39690. He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.
39691. 
39692. "And how's your father?"
39693. 
39694. "I received news of his death, yesterday," replied Prince Andrew
39695. abruptly.
39696. 
39697. Kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off
39698. his cap and crossed himself:
39699. 
39700. "May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God's will be done to us all!" He
39701. sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. "I
39702. loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart."
39703. 
39704. He embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some
39705. time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that
39706. Kutuzov's flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He
39707. sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.
39708. 
39709. "Come! Come with me, we'll have a talk," said he.
39710. 
39711. But at that moment Denisov, no more intimidated by his superiors than by
39712. the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite
39713. the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. Kutuzov, his
39714. hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. Denisov, having
39715. given his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene
39716. Highness a matter of great importance for their country's welfare.
39717. Kutuzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of
39718. annoyance, folded them across his stomach, repeating the words: "For our
39719. country's welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!" Denisov blushed like a
39720. girl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous,
39721. time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the
39722. enemy's lines of communication between Smolensk and Vyazma. Denisov came
39723. from those parts and knew the country well. His plan seemed decidedly
39724. a good one, especially from the strength of conviction with which he
39725. spoke. Kutuzov looked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the
39726. door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge
39727. from it. And from that hut, while Denisov was speaking, a general with a
39728. portfolio under his arm really did appear.
39729. 
39730. "What?" said Kutuzov, in the midst of Denisov's explanations, "are you
39731. ready so soon?"
39732. 
39733. "Ready, your Serene Highness," replied the general.
39734. 
39735. Kutuzov swayed his head, as much as to say: "How is one man to deal with
39736. it all?" and again listened to Denisov.
39737. 
39738. "I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer," said Denisov, "that I
39739. can bweak Napoleon's line of communication!"
39740. 
39741. "What relation are you to Intendant General Kiril Andreevich Denisov?"
39742. asked Kutuzov, interrupting him.
39743. 
39744. "He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness."
39745. 
39746. "Ah, we were friends," said Kutuzov cheerfully. "All right, all right,
39747. friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we'll have a talk."
39748. 
39749. With a nod to Denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers
39750. Konovnitsyn had brought him.
39751. 
39752. "Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?" said the general
39753. on duty in a discontented voice, "the plans must be examined and several
39754. papers have to be signed."
39755. 
39756. An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness
39757. within. But Kutuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he
39758. was disengaged. He made a grimace...
39759. 
39760. "No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I'll look
39761. at them here," said he. "Don't go away," he added, turning to Prince
39762. Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the general's report.
39763. 
39764. While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a woman's
39765. voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times on
39766. glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome
39767. woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding
39768. a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief.
39769. Kutuzov's adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of
39770. the priest whose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene
39771. Highness bread and salt. "Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness
39772. with the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the
39773. house.... She's very pretty," added the adjutant with a smile. At
39774. those words Kutuzov looked round. He was listening to the general's
39775. report--which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at
39776. Tsarevo-Zaymishche--as he had listened to Denisov, and seven years
39777. previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of
39778. war. He evidently listened only because he had ears which, though there
39779. was a piece of tow in one of them, could not help hearing; but it
39780. was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even
39781. interest him, that he knew all that would be said beforehand, and heard
39782. it all only because he had to, as one has to listen to the chanting of
39783. a service of prayer. All that Denisov had said was clever and to the
39784. point. What the general was saying was even more clever and to
39785. the point, but it was evident that Kutuzov despised knowledge
39786. and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the
39787. matter--something independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince
39788. Andrew watched the commander in chief's face attentively, and the only
39789. expression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the
39790. meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to
39791. observe propriety. It was evident that Kutuzov despised cleverness and
39792. learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denisov, but despised
39793. them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge--he did
39794. not try to display any of these--but because of something else. He
39795. despised them because of his old age and experience of life. The only
39796. instruction Kutuzov gave of his own accord during that report referred
39797. to looting by the Russian troops. At the end of the report the general
39798. put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment
39799. from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when
39800. landowners lodged petitions for compensation.
39801. 
39802. After hearing the matter, Kutuzov smacked his lips together and shook
39803. his head.
39804. 
39805. "Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my
39806. dear fellow," said he, "into the fire with all such things! Let them cut
39807. the crops and burn wood to their hearts' content. I don't order it
39808. or allow it, but I don't exact compensation either. One can't get on
39809. without it. 'When wood is chopped the chips will fly.'" He looked at the
39810. paper again. "Oh, this German precision!" he muttered, shaking his head.
39811. 
39812. 
39813. 
39814. 
39815. 
39816. CHAPTER XVI
39817. 
39818. 
39819. "Well, that's all!" said Kutuzov as he signed the last of the documents,
39820. and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he
39821. moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.
39822. 
39823. The priest's wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after
39824. all not managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long
39825. been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to Kutuzov.
39826. 
39827. He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:
39828. 
39829. "Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!"
39830. 
39831. He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the
39832. dish for her. "Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?" he asked,
39833. moving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priest's wife
39834. smiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room.
39835. The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with
39836. him. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to Kutuzov.
39837. He found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same unbuttoned
39838. overcoat. He had in his hand a French book which he closed as Prince
39839. Andrew entered, marking the place with a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the
39840. cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.
39841. 
39842. "Well, sit down, sit down here. Let's have a talk," said Kutuzov. "It's
39843. sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you,
39844. a second father...."
39845. 
39846. Prince Andrew told Kutuzov all he knew of his father's death, and what
39847. he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.
39848. 
39849. "What... what they have brought us to!" Kutuzov suddenly cried in an
39850. agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince
39851. Andrew's story the condition Russia was in. "But give me time, give me
39852. time!" he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this
39853. agitating conversation, and added: "I sent for you to keep you with me."
39854. 
39855. "I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the
39856. staff," replied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kutuzov noticed.
39857. 
39858. Kutuzov glanced inquiringly at him.
39859. 
39860. "But above all," added Prince Andrew, "I have grown used to my regiment,
39861. am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should be
39862. sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you,
39863. believe me..."
39864. 
39865. A shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kutuzov's podgy
39866. face. He cut Bolkonski short.
39867. 
39868. "I am sorry, for I need you. But you're right, you're right! It's not
39869. here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are
39870. not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers
39871. served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember,
39872. yes, I remember you with the standard!" said Kutuzov, and a flush of
39873. pleasure suffused Prince Andrew's face at this recollection.
39874. 
39875. Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutuzov offered his cheek to
39876. be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man's eyes.
39877. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutuzov's tears came easily, and that he
39878. was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to
39879. show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both
39880. pleasant and flattering to him.
39881. 
39882. "Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of
39883. honor!" He paused. "I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to
39884. send." And changing the subject, Kutuzov began to speak of the Turkish
39885. war and the peace that had been concluded. "Yes, I have been much
39886. blamed," he said, "both for that war and the peace... but everything
39887. came at the right time. Tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre. *
39888. And there were as many advisers there as here..." he went on, returning
39889. to the subject of "advisers" which evidently occupied him. "Ah, those
39890. advisers!" said he. "If we had listened to them all we should not have
39891. made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war.
39892. Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. Kamenski would have
39893. been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand
39894. men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to
39895. win a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patience and
39896. time are wanted. Kamenski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed
39897. these two things and took more fortresses than Kamenski and made them
39898. Turks eat horseflesh!" He swayed his head. "And the French shall too,
39899. believe me," he went on, growing warmer and beating his chest, "I'll
39900. make them eat horseflesh!" And tears again dimmed his eyes.
39901. 
39902. 
39903.     * "Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait."
39904. 
39905. 
39906. "But shan't we have to accept battle?" remarked Prince Andrew.
39907. 
39908. "We shall if everybody wants it; it can't be helped.... But believe
39909. me, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two: patience and
39910. time, they will do it all. But the advisers n'entendent pas de cette
39911. oreille, voila le mal. * Some want a thing--others don't. What's one to
39912. do?" he asked, evidently expecting an answer. "Well, what do you want
39913. us to do?" he repeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look.
39914. "I'll tell you what to do," he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not
39915. reply: "I will tell you what to do, and what I do. Dans le doute, mon
39916. cher," he paused, "abstiens-toi" *(2)--he articulated the French proverb
39917. deliberately.
39918. 
39919. 
39920.      * "Don't see it that way, that's the trouble."
39921. 
39922.      * (2) "When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing."
39923. 
39924. 
39925. "Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share
39926. your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince,
39927. nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come
39928. straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy."
39929. 
39930. Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter
39931. had left the room Kutuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his
39932. unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.
39933. 
39934. Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that
39935. interview with Kutuzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to
39936. the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been
39937. entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in
39938. that old man--in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions,
39939. and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions)
39940. only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events--the more
39941. reassured he was that everything would be as it should. "He will not
39942. bring in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake
39943. anything," thought Prince Andrew, "but he will hear everything, remember
39944. everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder
39945. anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is
39946. something stronger and more important than his own will--the inevitable
39947. course of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance,
39948. and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his
39949. personal wish directed to something else. And above all," thought Prince
39950. Andrew, "one believes in him because he's Russian, despite the novel
39951. by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he
39952. said: 'What they have brought us to!' and had a sob in it when he said
39953. he would 'make them eat horseflesh!'"
39954. 
39955. On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and
39956. general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the
39957. popular choice of Kutuzov as commander in chief was received.
39958. 
39959. 
39960. 
39961. 
39962. 
39963. CHAPTER XVII
39964. 
39965. 
39966. After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual
39967. course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to
39968. remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe
39969. that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English
39970. Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything
39971. for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had
39972. displayed during the Emperor's stay was the call for contributions of
39973. men and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made
39974. assumed a legal, official form and became unavoidable.
39975. 
39976. With the enemy's approach to Moscow, the Moscovites' view of their
39977. situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even
39978. more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger
39979. approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that
39980. speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a
39981. man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it;
39982. the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and
39983. painful to think of the danger, since it is not in man's power to
39984. foresee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is
39985. therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to
39986. think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man generally listens to
39987. the first voice, but in society to the second. So it was now with the
39988. inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people had been as gay in
39989. Moscow as that year.
39990. 
39991. Rostopchin's broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman,
39992. and a Moscow burgher called Karpushka Chigirin, "who--having been
39993. a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub--heard that
39994. Napoleon wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the French in very
39995. bad language, came out of the drink shop, and, under the sign of the
39996. eagle, began to address the assembled people," were read and discussed,
39997. together with the latest of Vasili Lvovich Pushkin's bouts rimes.
39998. 
39999. In the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these
40000. broadsheets, and some liked the way Karpushka jeered at the French,
40001. saying: "They will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our
40002. buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are all
40003. dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork."
40004. Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was
40005. said that Rostopchin had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners
40006. from Moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon
40007. among them; but this was told chiefly to introduce Rostopchin's witty
40008. remark on that occasion. The foreigners were deported to Nizhni by boat,
40009. and Rostopchin had said to them in French: "Rentrez en vousmemes; entrez
40010. dans la barque, et n'en faites pas une barque de Charon." * There was
40011. talk of all the government offices having been already removed from
40012. Moscow, and to this Shinshin's witticism was added--that for that alone
40013. Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mamonov's
40014. regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bezukhov
40015. had spent even more on his, but that the best thing about Bezukhov's
40016. action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the
40017. head of his regiment without charging anything for the show.
40018. 
40019. 
40020.      * "Think it over; get into the barque, and take care not to
40021.      make it a barque of Charon."
40022. 
40023. 
40024. "You don't spare anyone," said Julie Drubetskaya as she collected
40025. and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed
40026. fingers.
40027. 
40028. Julie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell
40029. soiree.
40030. 
40031. "Bezukhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What
40032. pleasure is there to be so caustique?"
40033. 
40034. "A forfeit!" cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called "mon
40035. chevalier," and who was going with her to Nizhni.
40036. 
40037. In Julie's set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed
40038. that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a
40039. slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary
40040. Contributions.
40041. 
40042. "Another forfeit for a Gallicism," said a Russian writer who was
40043. present. "'What pleasure is there to be' is not Russian!"
40044. 
40045. "You spare no one," continued Julie to the young man without heeding the
40046. author's remark.
40047. 
40048. "For caustique--I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay again
40049. for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I won't be
40050. responsible," she remarked, turning to the author: "I have neither the
40051. money nor the time, like Prince Galitsyn, to engage a master to teach me
40052. Russian!"
40053. 
40054. "Ah, here he is!" she added. "Quand on... No, no," she said to the
40055. militia officer, "you won't catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its
40056. rays!" and she smiled amiably at Pierre. "We were just talking of you,"
40057. she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman. "We were
40058. saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than Mamonov's."
40059. 
40060. "Oh, don't talk to me of my regiment," replied Pierre, kissing his
40061. hostess' hand and taking a seat beside her. "I am so sick of it."
40062. 
40063. "You will, of course, command it yourself?" said Julie, directing a sly,
40064. sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.
40065. 
40066. The latter in Pierre's presence had ceased to be caustic, and his face
40067. expressed perplexity as to what Julie's smile might mean. In spite of
40068. his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre's personality immediately
40069. checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.
40070. 
40071. "No," said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. "I
40072. should make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I
40073. should hardly be able to climb onto a horse."
40074. 
40075. Among those whom Julie's guests happened to choose to gossip about were
40076. the Rostovs.
40077. 
40078. "I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way," said Julie. "And he
40079. is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The Razumovskis wanted
40080. to buy his house and his estate near Moscow, but it drags on and on. He
40081. asks too much."
40082. 
40083. "No, I think the sale will come off in a few days," said someone.
40084. "Though it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now."
40085. 
40086. "Why?" asked Julie. "You don't think Moscow is in danger?"
40087. 
40088. "Then why are you leaving?"
40089. 
40090. "I? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is
40091. going: and besides--I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon."
40092. 
40093. "Well, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen."
40094. 
40095. "If he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his
40096. debts," said the militia officer, speaking of Rostov.
40097. 
40098. "A kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so long in
40099. Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago. Natalie is quite
40100. well again now, isn't she?" Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile.
40101. 
40102. "They are waiting for their younger son," Pierre replied. "He joined
40103. Obolenski's Cossacks and went to Belaya Tserkov where the regiment is
40104. being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and
40105. are expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave long ago, but the
40106. countess won't on any account leave Moscow till her son returns."
40107. 
40108. "I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkharovs'. Natalie has
40109. recovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily some
40110. people get over everything!"
40111. 
40112. "Get over what?" inquired Pierre, looking displeased.
40113. 
40114. Julie smiled.
40115. 
40116. "You know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de
40117. Souza's novels."
40118. 
40119. "What knights? What do you mean?" demanded Pierre, blushing.
40120. 
40121. "Oh, come, my dear count! C'est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous admire,
40122. ma parole d'honneur!" *
40123. 
40124. 
40125.     * "It is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!"
40126. 
40127. 
40128. "Forfeit, forfeit!" cried the militia officer.
40129. 
40130. "All right, one can't talk--how tiresome!"
40131. 
40132. "What is 'the talk of all Moscow'?" Pierre asked angrily, rising to his
40133. feet.
40134. 
40135. "Come now, Count, you know!"
40136. 
40137. "I don't know anything about it," said Pierre.
40138. 
40139. "I know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always more
40140. friendly with Vera--that dear Vera."
40141. 
40142. "No, madame!" Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, "I have not
40143. taken on myself the role of Natalie Rostova's knight at all, and have
40144. not been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot understand the
40145. cruelty..."
40146. 
40147. "Qui s'excuse s'accuse," * said Julie, smiling and waving the lint
40148. triumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the
40149. subject. "Do you know what I heard today? Poor Mary Bolkonskaya arrived
40150. in Moscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her father?"
40151. 
40152. 
40153.     * "Who excuses himself, accuses himself."
40154. 
40155. 
40156. "Really? Where is she? I should like very much to see her," said Pierre.
40157. 
40158. "I spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their estate
40159. near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew."
40160. 
40161. "Well, and how is she?" asked Pierre.
40162. 
40163. "She is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is quite a
40164. romance. Nicholas Rostov! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill
40165. her and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in and saved her...."
40166. 
40167. "Another romance," said the militia officer. "Really, this general
40168. flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche
40169. is one and Princess Bolkonskaya another."
40170. 
40171. "Do you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune
40172. homme." *
40173. 
40174. 
40175.     * "A little bit in love with the young man."
40176. 
40177. 
40178. "Forfeit, forfeit, forfeit!"
40179. 
40180. "But how could one say that in Russian?"
40181. 
40182. 
40183. 
40184. 
40185. 
40186. CHAPTER XVIII
40187. 
40188. 
40189. When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchin's broadsheets
40190. that had been brought that day.
40191. 
40192. The first declared that the report that Count Rostopchin had forbidden
40193. people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was glad that
40194. ladies and tradesmen's wives were leaving the city. "There will be less
40195. panic and less gossip," ran the broadsheet "but I will stake my life
40196. on it that scoundrel will not enter Moscow." These words showed Pierre
40197. clearly for the first time that the French would enter Moscow. The
40198. second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at Vyazma, that
40199. Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as many of the
40200. inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were ready for them
40201. at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which could be had at a low
40202. price. The tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former
40203. Chigirin talks. Pierre pondered over these broadsheets. Evidently the
40204. terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul
40205. but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near.
40206. 
40207. "Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?" he asked himself
40208. for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on the table
40209. and began to lay them out for a game of patience.
40210. 
40211. "If this patience comes out," he said to himself after shuffling the
40212. cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, "if it comes out,
40213. it means... what does it mean?"
40214. 
40215. He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the
40216. eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.
40217. 
40218. "Then it will mean that I must go to the army," said Pierre to himself.
40219. "Come in, come in!" he added to the princess.
40220. 
40221. Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist,
40222. was still living in Pierre's house. The two younger ones had both
40223. married.
40224. 
40225. "Excuse my coming to you, cousin," she said in a reproachful and
40226. agitated voice. "You know some decision must be come to. What is going
40227. to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is
40228. it that we are staying on?"
40229. 
40230. "On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine," said Pierre
40231. in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling
40232. uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.
40233. 
40234. "Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivanovna told me today
40235. how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them
40236. credit! And the people too are quite mutinous--they no longer obey,
40237. even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin
40238. beating us. One can't walk in the streets. But, above all, the French
40239. will be here any day now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one
40240. thing of you, cousin," she went on, "arrange for me to be taken to
40241. Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I can't live under Bonaparte's rule."
40242. 
40243. "Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On the
40244. contrary..."
40245. 
40246. "I won't submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you
40247. don't want to do this..."
40248. 
40249. "But I will, I'll give the order at once."
40250. 
40251. The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with.
40252. Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.
40253. 
40254. "But you have been misinformed," said Pierre. "Everything is quiet in
40255. the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! I've just been
40256. reading..." He showed her the broadsheet. "Count Rostopchin writes that
40257. he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow."
40258. 
40259. "Oh, that count of yours!" said the princess malevolently. "He is a
40260. hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didn't
40261. he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, 'whoever it might be,
40262. should be dragged to the lockup by his hair'? (How silly!) 'And honor
40263. and glory to whoever captures him,' he says. This is what his cajolery
40264. has brought us to! Barbara Ivanovna told me the mob near killed her
40265. because she said something in French."
40266. 
40267. "Oh, but it's so... You take everything so to heart," said Pierre, and
40268. began laying out his cards for patience.
40269. 
40270. Although that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army,
40271. but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation,
40272. irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting
40273. something terrible.
40274. 
40275. Next day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre's head steward
40276. came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his
40277. regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates. In
40278. general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising
40279. a regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to
40280. repress a smile.
40281. 
40282. "Well then, sell it," said he. "What's to be done? I can't draw back
40283. now!"
40284. 
40285. The worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the better
40286. was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he
40287. expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was left in town. Julie
40288. had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends only the
40289. Rostovs remained, but he did not go to see them.
40290. 
40291. To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Vorontsovo
40292. to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe,
40293. and a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The balloon was not yet
40294. ready, but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor's
40295. desire. The Emperor had written to Count Rostopchin as follows:
40296. 
40297. 
40298. As soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and
40299. intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutuzov to let
40300. him know. I have informed him of the matter.
40301. 
40302. Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for
40303. the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy's
40304. hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of
40305. the commander in chief.
40306. 
40307. 
40308. On his way home from Vorontsovo, as he was passing the Bolotnoe Place
40309. Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the Lobnoe Place, stopped and got out
40310. of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The
40311. flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the
40312. flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and
40313. a green jacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and
40314. pale, stood near. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With
40315. a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchman's
40316. face, Pierre pushed his way in through the crowd.
40317. 
40318. "What is it? Who is it? What is it for?" he kept asking.
40319. 
40320. But the attention of the crowd--officials, burghers, shopkeepers,
40321. peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses--was so eagerly centered
40322. on what was passing in Lobnoe Place that no one answered him. The stout
40323. man rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to
40324. appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but
40325. suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded
40326. grown-up men cry, though angry with himself for doing so. In the crowd
40327. people began talking loudly, to stifle their feelings of pity as it
40328. seemed to Pierre.
40329. 
40330. "He's cook to some prince."
40331. 
40332. "Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his
40333. teeth on edge!" said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre,
40334. when the Frenchman began to cry.
40335. 
40336. The clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be
40337. appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in
40338. dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.
40339. 
40340. Pierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back
40341. to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took his
40342. seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so
40343. audibly that the coachman asked him:
40344. 
40345. "What is your pleasure?"
40346. 
40347. "Where are you going?" shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to
40348. Lubyanka Street.
40349. 
40350. "To the Governor's, as you ordered," answered the coachman.
40351. 
40352. "Fool! Idiot!" shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman--a thing he rarely
40353. did. "Home, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!" "I must get away
40354. this very day," he murmured to himself.
40355. 
40356. At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the
40357. Lobnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no
40358. longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that
40359. it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the
40360. man ought to have known it for himself.
40361. 
40362. On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstafey--his head coachman who
40363. knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow--that
40364. he would leave that night for the army at Mozhaysk, and that his saddle
40365. horses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged that day,
40366. so on Evstafey's representation Pierre had to put off his departure till
40367. next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.
40368. 
40369. On the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain, and
40370. after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night
40371. in Perkhushkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that
40372. evening. (This was the battle of Shevardino.) He was told that there in
40373. Perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer
40374. his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching
40375. Mozhaysk.
40376. 
40377. Every house in Mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel
40378. where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be
40379. had. It was full of officers.
40380. 
40381. Everywhere in Mozhaysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the
40382. march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon
40383. were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the
40384. farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea
40385. of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and
40386. joyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a feeling akin to
40387. what he had felt at the Sloboda Palace during the Emperor's visit--a
40388. sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing
40389. something. He now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that
40390. constitutes men's happiness--the comforts of life, wealth, even
40391. life itself--is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away, compared with
40392. something... With what? Pierre could not say, and he did not try to
40393. determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in
40394. sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the question of what to
40395. sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and
40396. joyous sensation.
40397. 
40398. 
40399. 
40400. 
40401. 
40402. CHAPTER XIX
40403. 
40404. 
40405. On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevardino Redoubt was
40406. fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on
40407. the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodino itself took place.
40408. 
40409. Why and how were the battles of Shevardino and Borodino given and
40410. accepted? Why was the battle of Borodino fought? There was not the least
40411. sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result
40412. for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer
40413. to the destruction of Moscow--which we feared more than anything in
40414. the world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were
40415. brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army--which they feared
40416. more than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite
40417. obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and Kutuzov accepted that battle.
40418. 
40419. If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must
40420. have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles
40421. and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army,
40422. he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally
40423. clear to Kutuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a
40424. quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For Kutuzov this was
40425. mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one
40426. man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore
40427. should not exchange. When my opponent has sixteen men and I have
40428. fourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than he, but when I have exchanged
40429. thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as I am.
40430. 
40431. Before the battle of Borodino our strength in proportion to the French
40432. was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than
40433. one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and
40434. twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a
40435. hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced Kutuzov accepted the
40436. battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius,
40437. gave it, losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of
40438. communication still more. If it is said that he expected to end the
40439. campaign by occupying Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by
40440. occupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleon's
40441. historians themselves tell us that from Smolensk onwards he wished
40442. to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the
40443. occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had
40444. seen at Smolensk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and
40445. had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his
40446. wish to negotiate.
40447. 
40448. In giving and accepting battle at Borodino, Kutuzov acted involuntarily
40449. and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had occurred, the historians
40450. provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the
40451. generals who, of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved
40452. and involuntary.
40453. 
40454. The ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish
40455. the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to accustom
40456. ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are
40457. meaningless.
40458. 
40459. On the other question, how the battle of Borodino and the preceding
40460. battle of Shevardino were fought, there also exists a definite and
40461. well-known, but quite false, conception. All the historians describe the
40462. affair as follows:
40463. 
40464. The Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smolensk sought out
40465. for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a
40466. position at Borodino.
40467. 
40468. The Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the left
40469. of the highroad (from Moscow to Smolensk) and almost at a right angle
40470. to it, from Borodino to Utitsa, at the very place where the battle was
40471. fought.
40472. 
40473. In front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set up on
40474. the Shevardino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, we
40475. are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the
40476. twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in position on
40477. the field of Borodino.
40478. 
40479. So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to
40480. look into the matter can easily convince himself.
40481. 
40482. The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary,
40483. during the retreat passed many positions better than Borodino. They did
40484. not stop at any one of these positions because Kutuzov did not wish to
40485. occupy a position he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand
40486. for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough, and because
40487. Miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia, and for many other
40488. reasons. The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger,
40489. and that the position at Borodino (the one where the battle was fought),
40490. far from being strong, was no more a position than any other spot one
40491. might find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at
40492. hazard.
40493. 
40494. Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of
40495. Borodino to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that
40496. is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the
40497. twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be
40498. fought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no
40499. entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the
40500. twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the
40501. position of the Shevardino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless
40502. in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it
40503. more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts
40504. exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at
40505. night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to
40506. observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the
40507. battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the Shevardino Redoubt
40508. was not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to
40509. the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagration were convinced that the
40510. Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that Kutuzov
40511. himself in his report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of
40512. the Shevardino Redoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much
40513. later, when reports on the battle of Borodino were written at leisure,
40514. that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to
40515. justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented
40516. as infallible) that the Shevardino Redoubt was an advanced post--whereas
40517. in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank--and
40518. that the battle of Borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position
40519. previously selected, where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot
40520. which was almost unentrenched.
40521. 
40522. The case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river
40523. Kolocha--which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute
40524. angle--so that the left flank was at Shevardino, the right flank near
40525. the village of Novoe, and the center at Borodino at the confluence of
40526. the rivers Kolocha and Voyna.
40527. 
40528. To anyone who looks at the field of Borodino without thinking of how
40529. the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river
40530. Kolocha, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to
40531. prevent an enemy from advancing along the Smolensk road to Moscow.
40532. 
40533. Napoleon, riding to Valuevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the
40534. history books say he did) the position of the Russians from Utitsa
40535. to Borodino (he could not have seen that position because it did not
40536. exist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while
40537. pursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the
40538. Russian position--at the Shevardino Redoubt--and unexpectedly for the
40539. Russians moved his army across the Kolocha. And the Russians, not having
40540. time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the
40541. position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which
40542. had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By crossing to the other
40543. side of the Kolocha to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the
40544. whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the Russian
40545. side) and transferred it to the plain between Utitsa, Semenovsk, and
40546. Borodino--a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other
40547. plain in Russia--and there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of
40548. August took place.
40549. 
40550. Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the
40551. Kolocha, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt
40552. but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that
40553. the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the
40554. battle would have taken place where we expected it. In that case
40555. we should probably have defended the Shevardino Redoubt--our left
40556. flank--still more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the
40557. center or on the right, and the engagement would have taken place on the
40558. twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. But as the
40559. attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of
40560. our rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at Gridneva), and
40561. as the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a
40562. general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first
40563. and chief action of the battle of Borodino was already lost on the
40564. twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the
40565. twenty-sixth.
40566. 
40567. After the loss of the Shevardino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the
40568. morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and
40569. were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to
40570. be.
40571. 
40572. Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,
40573. unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was
40574. increased by the fact that the Russian commanders--not having fully
40575. realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left
40576. flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from
40577. right to left--maintained their extended position from the village of
40578. Novoe to Utitsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to
40579. left during the battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle
40580. the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left
40581. flank with but half as many men. (Poniatowski's action against Utitsa,
40582. and Uvarov's on the right flank against the French, were actions
40583. distinct from the main course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodino
40584. did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders'
40585. mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian
40586. army and people) it has been described. The battle of Borodino was not
40587. fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly
40588. weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the
40589. Shevardino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodino on an
40590. open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous
40591. as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not
40592. merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive
40593. result, but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete
40594. disintegration and flight.
40595. 
40596. 
40597. 
40598. 
40599. 
40600. CHAPTER XX
40601. 
40602. 
40603. On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozhaysk. At the
40604. descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the
40605. town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and
40606. the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on
40607. foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by
40608. its singers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who
40609. had been wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers,
40610. shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The
40611. carts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying
40612. or sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep
40613. incline to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged with
40614. rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to
40615. the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost
40616. all of them stared with naive, childlike curiosity at Pierre's white hat
40617. and green swallow-tail coat.
40618. 
40619. Pierre's coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to
40620. one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill
40621. with its singers, surrounded Pierre's carriage and blocked the road.
40622. Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in which
40623. the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into
40624. the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierre's head was
40625. the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily. One of the
40626. carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre. The
40627. driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one
40628. of its tireless hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his
40629. little horse.
40630. 
40631. One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following
40632. the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to
40633. look at Pierre.
40634. 
40635. "I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to
40636. Moscow?" he asked.
40637. 
40638. Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was
40639. looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded,
40640. now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men
40641. were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had
40642. probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags
40643. and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby's head. His nose
40644. and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the
40645. cathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired
40646. recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looked
40647. at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third lay prone so that his
40648. face was not visible. The cavalry singers were passing close by:
40649. 
40650.    Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,
40651.    Living in a foreign land.
40652. 
40653. they sang their soldiers' dance song.
40654. 
40655. As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the
40656. metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of
40657. the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of
40658. merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded near the
40659. panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber, and sad.
40660. 
40661. The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry
40662. singers.
40663. 
40664. "Oh, the coxcombs!" he muttered reproachfully.
40665. 
40666. "It's not the soldiers only, but I've seen peasants today, too....
40667. The peasants--even they have to go," said the soldier behind the cart,
40668. addressing Pierre with a sad smile. "No distinctions made nowadays....
40669. They want the whole nation to fall on them--in a word, it's Moscow! They
40670. want to make an end of it."
40671. 
40672. In spite of the obscurity of the soldier's words Pierre understood what
40673. he wanted to say and nodded approval.
40674. 
40675. The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.
40676. 
40677. He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but only
40678. saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different
40679. branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at his white
40680. hat and green tail coat.
40681. 
40682. Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and
40683. eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was
40684. driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon,
40685. and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driver's
40686. seat to pull up.
40687. 
40688. "Count! Your excellency, how come you to be here?" asked the doctor.
40689. 
40690. "Well, you know, I wanted to see..."
40691. 
40692. "Yes, yes, there will be something to see...."
40693. 
40694. Pierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of
40695. taking part in a battle.
40696. 
40697. The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutuzov.
40698. 
40699. "Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?" he
40700. said, exchanging glances with his young companion. "Anyhow his Serene
40701. Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. That's what you must
40702. do."
40703. 
40704. The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.
40705. 
40706. "You think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is
40707. exactly?" said Pierre.
40708. 
40709. "The position?" repeated the doctor. "Well, that's not my line. Drive
40710. past Tatarinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the hillock
40711. and you'll see."
40712. 
40713. "Can one see from there?... If you would..."
40714. 
40715. But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.
40716. 
40717. "I would go with you but on my honor I'm up to here"--and he pointed to
40718. his throat. "I'm galloping to the commander of the corps. How do matters
40719. stand?... You know, Count, there'll be a battle tomorrow. Out of an army
40720. of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded,
40721. and we haven't stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for
40722. six thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we need other things as
40723. well--we must manage as best we can!"
40724. 
40725. The strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who
40726. had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had
40727. noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death
40728. amazed Pierre.
40729. 
40730. "They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?"
40731. And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozhaysk hill,
40732. the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the
40733. sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.
40734. 
40735. "The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment
40736. think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded. Yet from
40737. among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they wonder at my
40738. hat! Strange!" thought Pierre, continuing his way to Tatarinova.
40739. 
40740. In front of a landowner's house to the left of the road stood carriages,
40741. wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The commander in chief
40742. was putting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and
40743. hardly any of the staff were there--they had gone to the church service.
40744. Pierre drove on toward Gorki.
40745. 
40746. When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he
40747. saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with
40748. crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and
40749. perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the
40750. right of the road.
40751. 
40752. Some of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth
40753. along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.
40754. 
40755. Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On seeing
40756. these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their
40757. position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at
40758. Mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said: "They
40759. want the whole nation to fall on them." The sight of these bearded
40760. peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots
40761. and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward
40762. the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed
40763. Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment
40764. than anything he had yet seen or heard.
40765. 
40766. 
40767. 
40768. 
40769. 
40770. CHAPTER XXI
40771. 
40772. 
40773. Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen,
40774. ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield
40775. could be seen.
40776. 
40777. It was about eleven o'clock. The sun shone somewhat to the left and
40778. behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising like
40779. an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.
40780. 
40781. From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the Smolensk
40782. highroad, passing through a village with a white church some five
40783. hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was Borodino.
40784. Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding
40785. down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of Valuevo visible
40786. about four miles away, where Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond Valuevo
40787. the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in
40788. the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the
40789. cross and belfry of the Kolocha Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and
40790. there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the
40791. forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite
40792. masses of troops--ours and the enemy's. The ground to the right--along
40793. the course of the Kolocha and Moskva rivers--was broken and hilly.
40794. Between the hollows the villages of Bezubova and Zakharino showed in the
40795. distance. On the left the ground was more level; there were fields of
40796. grain, and the smoking ruins of Semenovsk, which had been burned down,
40797. could be seen.
40798. 
40799. All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the
40800. right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere
40801. could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only fields,
40802. meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and
40803. streams; and try as he would he could descry no military "position" in
40804. this place which teemed with life, nor could he even distinguish our
40805. troops from the enemy's.
40806. 
40807. "I must ask someone who knows," he thought, and addressed an officer who
40808. was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.
40809. 
40810. "May I ask you," said Pierre, "what village that is in front?"
40811. 
40812. "Burdino, isn't it?" said the officer, turning to his companion.
40813. 
40814. "Borodino," the other corrected him.
40815. 
40816. The officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up to
40817. Pierre.
40818. 
40819. "Are those our men there?" Pierre inquired.
40820. 
40821. "Yes, and there, further on, are the French," said the officer. "There
40822. they are, there... you can see them."
40823. 
40824. "Where? Where?" asked Pierre.
40825. 
40826. "One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!"
40827. 
40828. The officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left
40829. beyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that Pierre
40830. had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.
40831. 
40832. "Ah, those are the French! And over there?..." Pierre pointed to a knoll
40833. on the left, near which some troops could be seen.
40834. 
40835. "Those are ours."
40836. 
40837. "Ah, ours! And there?..." Pierre pointed to another knoll in the
40838. distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow
40839. where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible.
40840. 
40841. "That's his again," said the officer. (It was the Shevardino Redoubt.)
40842. "It was ours yesterday, but now it is his."
40843. 
40844. "Then how about our position?"
40845. 
40846. "Our position?" replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. "I
40847. can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our
40848. entrenchments. There, you see? There's our center, at Borodino, just
40849. there," and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white
40850. church. "That's where one crosses the Kolocha. You see down there where
40851. the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there's the bridge. That's our
40852. center. Our right flank is over there"--he pointed sharply to the right,
40853. far away in the broken ground--"That's where the Moskva River is, and
40854. we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong ones. The left
40855. flank..." here the officer paused. "Well, you see, that's difficult to
40856. explain.... Yesterday our left flank was there at Shevardino, you see,
40857. where the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wing--now it is
40858. over there, do you see that village and the smoke? That's Semenovsk,
40859. yes, there," he pointed to Raevski's knoll. "But the battle will hardly
40860. be there. His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will
40861. probably pass round to the right of the Moskva. But wherever it may be,
40862. many a man will be missing tomorrow!" he remarked.
40863. 
40864. An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving
40865. these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking, but
40866. at this point, evidently not liking the officer's remark, interrupted
40867. him.
40868. 
40869. "Gabions must be sent for," said he sternly.
40870. 
40871. The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might
40872. think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak
40873. of it.
40874. 
40875. "Well, send number three company again," the officer replied hurriedly.
40876. 
40877. "And you, are you one of the doctors?"
40878. 
40879. "No, I've come on my own," answered Pierre, and he went down the hill
40880. again, passing the militiamen.
40881. 
40882. "Oh, those damned fellows!" muttered the officer who followed him,
40883. holding his nose as he ran past the men at work.
40884. 
40885. "There they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... They'll be
40886. here in a minute..." voices were suddenly heard saying; and officers,
40887. soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.
40888. 
40889. A church procession was coming up the hill from Borodino. First along
40890. the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms
40891. reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.
40892. 
40893. Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the
40894. procession.
40895. 
40896. "They are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of God!"
40897. someone cried.
40898. 
40899. "The Smolensk Mother of God," another corrected him.
40900. 
40901. The militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who had
40902. been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to meet the
40903. church procession. Following the battalion that marched along the dusty
40904. road came priests in their vestments--one little old man in a hood with
40905. attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large,
40906. dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was the icon that had
40907. been brought from Smolensk and had since accompanied the army. Behind,
40908. before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked,
40909. ran, and bowed to the ground.
40910. 
40911. At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had
40912. been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by
40913. others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot
40914. rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with
40915. the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon.
40916. The singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd
40917. of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon.
40918. Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot
40919. reserved for them. A bald general with a St. George's Cross on his neck
40920. stood just behind the priest's back, and without crossing himself (he
40921. was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which
40922. he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the
40923. patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial
40924. pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest
40925. while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre
40926. recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not
40927. look at them--his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious
40928. expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were
40929. all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were
40930. singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and
40931. mechanically to sing: "Save from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of
40932. God," and the priest and deacon chimed in: "For to Thee under God we all
40933. flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection," there again kindled in
40934. all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity
40935. of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of
40936. the hill at Mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met
40937. that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back,
40938. and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.
40939. 
40940. The crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre.
40941. Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way
40942. was made for him, was approaching the icon.
40943. 
40944. It was Kutuzov, who had been riding round the position and on his way
40945. back to Tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held. Pierre
40946. recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which distinguished him
40947. from everybody else.
40948. 
40949. With a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body,
40950. with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the
40951. eye he had lost, Kutuzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into
40952. the crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an
40953. accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and
40954. bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind Kutuzov was Bennigsen and
40955. the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who attracted
40956. the attention of all the superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers
40957. continued their prayers without looking at him.
40958. 
40959. When the service was over, Kutuzov stepped up to the icon, sank heavily
40960. to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried vainly to
40961. rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight. His
40962. white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as
40963. a child does with naively pouting lips, and again bowed till he touched
40964. the ground with his hand. The other generals followed his example,
40965. then the officers, and after them with excited faces, pressing on one
40966. another, crowding, panting, and pushing, scrambled the soldiers and
40967. militiamen.
40968. 
40969. 
40970. 
40971. 
40972. 
40973. CHAPTER XXII
40974. 
40975. 
40976. Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.
40977. 
40978. "Count Peter Kirilovich! How did you get here?" said a voice.
40979. 
40980. Pierre looked round. Boris Drubetskoy, brushing his knees with his hand
40981. (he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon),
40982. came up to him smiling. Boris was elegantly dressed, with a slightly
40983. martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long coat and like
40984. Kutuzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.
40985. 
40986. Meanwhile Kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself in the
40987. shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run
40988. to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and
40989. brilliant suite surrounded him.
40990. 
40991. The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre stopped
40992. some thirty paces from Kutuzov, talking to Boris.
40993. 
40994. He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the
40995. position.
40996. 
40997. "This is what you must do," said Boris. "I will do the honors of the
40998. camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen
40999. will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; I'll mention it to him.
41000. But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us. We are
41001. just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend the night
41002. with me and we'll arrange a game of cards. Of course you know Dmitri
41003. Sergeevich? Those are his quarters," and he pointed to the third house
41004. in the village of Gorki.
41005. 
41006. "But I should like to see the right flank. They say it's very strong,"
41007. said Pierre. "I should like to start from the Moskva River and ride
41008. round the whole position."
41009. 
41010. "Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank."
41011. 
41012. "Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkonski's regiment? Can you point it
41013. out to me?"
41014. 
41015. "Prince Andrew's? We shall pass it and I'll take you to him."
41016. 
41017. "What about the left flank?" asked Pierre
41018. 
41019. "To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state our
41020. left flank is in," said Boris confidentially lowering his voice. "It is
41021. not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll
41022. quite differently, but..." Boris shrugged his shoulders, "his Serene
41023. Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see..." but
41024. Boris did not finish, for at that moment Kaysarov, Kutuzov's adjutant,
41025. came up to Pierre. "Ah, Kaysarov!" said Boris, addressing him with an
41026. unembarrassed smile, "I was just trying to explain our position to
41027. the count. It is amazing how his Serene Highness could so foresee the
41028. intentions of the French!"
41029. 
41030. "You mean the left flank?" asked Kaysarov.
41031. 
41032. "Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong."
41033. 
41034. Though Kutuzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, Boris
41035. had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had
41036. established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom Boris
41037. had been in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetskoy an invaluable
41038. man.
41039. 
41040. In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: Kutuzov's
41041. party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Boris belonged to the
41042. latter and no one else, while showing servile respect to Kutuzov, could
41043. so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that
41044. Bennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come
41045. when Kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even
41046. if Kutuzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by
41047. Bennigsen. In any case many great rewards would have to be given for
41048. tomorrow's action, and new men would come to the front. So Boris was
41049. full of nervous vivacity all day.
41050. 
41051. After Kaysarov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had not
41052. time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon
41053. him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed
41054. animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of
41055. the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions
41056. of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different
41057. expression he saw on other faces--an expression that spoke not of
41058. personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death.
41059. Kutuzov noticed Pierre's figure and the group gathered round him.
41060. 
41061. "Call him to me," said Kutuzov.
41062. 
41063. An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness' wish, and Pierre went
41064. toward Kutuzov's bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It was
41065. Dolokhov.
41066. 
41067. "How did that fellow get here?" asked Pierre.
41068. 
41069. "He's a creature that wriggles in anywhere!" was the answer. "He
41070. has been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He's been
41071. proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy's picket
41072. line at night.... He's a brave fellow."
41073. 
41074. Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutuzov.
41075. 
41076. "I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send
41077. me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I shouldn't
41078. lose anything..." Dolokhov was saying.
41079. 
41080. "Yes, yes."
41081. 
41082. "But if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland
41083. for which I am ready to die."
41084. 
41085. "Yes, yes."
41086. 
41087. "And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his
41088. skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene
41089. Highness."
41090. 
41091. "Yes... Yes..." Kutuzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more and
41092. more as he looked at Pierre.
41093. 
41094. Just then Boris, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to
41095. Pierre's side near Kutuzov and in a most natural manner, without
41096. raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted
41097. conversation:
41098. 
41099. "The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What
41100. heroism, Count!"
41101. 
41102. Boris evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his
41103. Serene Highness. He knew Kutuzov's attention would be caught by those
41104. words, and so it was.
41105. 
41106. "What are you saying about the militia?" he asked Boris.
41107. 
41108. "Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness--for death--they have put
41109. on clean shirts."
41110. 
41111. "Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!" said Kutuzov; and he closed his
41112. eyes and swayed his head. "A matchless people!" he repeated with a sigh.
41113. 
41114. "So you want to smell gunpowder?" he said to Pierre. "Yes, it's a
41115. pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife's adorers. Is
41116. she well? My quarters are at your service."
41117. 
41118. And as often happens with old people, Kutuzov began looking about
41119. absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.
41120. 
41121. Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew
41122. Kaysarov, his adjutant's brother.
41123. 
41124. "Those verses... those verses of Marin's... how do they go, eh? Those he
41125. wrote about Gerakov: 'Lectures for the corps inditing'... Recite them,
41126. recite them!" said he, evidently preparing to laugh.
41127. 
41128. Kaysarov recited.... Kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of
41129. the verses.
41130. 
41131. When Pierre had left Kutuzov, Dolokhov came up to him and took his hand.
41132. 
41133. "I am very glad to meet you here, Count," he said aloud, regardless
41134. of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn
41135. tone. "On the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to
41136. survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the
41137. misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to
41138. have any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me."
41139. 
41140. Pierre looked at Dolokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him.
41141. With tears in his eyes Dolokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.
41142. 
41143. Boris said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to
41144. Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.
41145. 
41146. "It will interest you," said he.
41147. 
41148. "Yes, very much," replied Pierre.
41149. 
41150. Half an hour later Kutuzov left for Tatarinova, and Bennigsen and his
41151. suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the line.
41152. 
41153. 
41154. 
41155. 
41156. 
41157. CHAPTER XXIII
41158. 
41159. 
41160. From Gorki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which, when
41161. they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as
41162. being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay
41163. lay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of
41164. Borodino and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of
41165. troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging.
41166. This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as
41167. the Raevski Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special
41168. attention to it. He did not know that it would become more memorable to
41169. him than any other spot on the plain of Borodino.
41170. 
41171. They then crossed the hollow to Semenovsk, where the soldiers were
41172. dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode
41173. downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by
41174. hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows
41175. of the plowed land, and reached some fleches * which were still being
41176. dug.
41177. 
41178. 
41179.     * A kind of entrenchment.
41180. 
41181. 
41182. At the fleches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevardino
41183. Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several
41184. horsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or
41185. Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of
41186. horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the
41187. scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men
41188. rode away from the mound and disappeared.
41189. 
41190. Bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining
41191. the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each
41192. faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but
41193. was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the
41194. task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and,
41195. noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:
41196. 
41197. "I don't think this interests you?"
41198. 
41199. "On the contrary it's very interesting!" replied Pierre not quite
41200. truthfully.
41201. 
41202. From the fleches they rode still farther to the left, along a road
41203. winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of the
41204. wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of
41205. the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front
41206. of them for some time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only
41207. when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear
41208. in the thicket. After going through the wood for about a mile and a half
41209. they came out on a glade where troops of Tuchkov's corps were stationed
41210. to defend the left flank.
41211. 
41212. Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with
41213. much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military
41214. importance. In front of Tuchkov's troops was some high ground not
41215. occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying
41216. that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around
41217. unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed
41218. the same opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they
41219. were put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on his own authority ordered
41220. the troops to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank
41221. increased Pierre's doubt of his own capacity to understand military
41222. matters. Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the
41223. position of the troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and
41224. shared their opinion, but for that very reason he could not understand
41225. how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross
41226. and palpable a blunder.
41227. 
41228. Pierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed,
41229. put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as
41230. an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an
41231. approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know this and moved
41232. the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the
41233. matter to the commander in chief.
41234. 
41235. 
41236. 
41237. 
41238. 
41239. CHAPTER XXIV
41240. 
41241. 
41242. On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his
41243. elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkovo at the further
41244. end of his regiment's encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he
41245. could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty year-old birches
41246. with their lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of
41247. oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose the smoke of
41248. campfires--the soldiers' kitchens.
41249. 
41250. Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to
41251. him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as
41252. he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.
41253. 
41254. He had received and given the orders for next day's battle and had
41255. nothing more to do. But his thoughts--the simplest, clearest, and
41256. therefore most terrible thoughts--would give him no peace. He knew that
41257. tomorrow's battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken
41258. part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of death
41259. presented itself to him--not in relation to any worldly matter or with
41260. reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to himself, to
41261. his own soul--vividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as a certainty. And
41262. from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and
41263. preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without
41264. shadows, without perspective, without distinction of outline. All life
41265. appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been
41266. gazing by artificial light through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those
41267. badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. "Yes,
41268. yes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured,
41269. and tormented me," said he to himself, passing in review the principal
41270. pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold
41271. white daylight of his clear perception of death. "There they are, those
41272. rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious.
41273. Glory, the good of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself--how
41274. important these pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they
41275. seemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the
41276. cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me." The
41277. three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his
41278. love for a woman, his father's death, and the French invasion which had
41279. overrun half Russia. "Love... that little girl who seemed to me brimming
41280. over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made romantic plans
41281. of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I was!" he said aloud
41282. bitterly. "Ah me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her
41283. faithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove
41284. in the fable she was to pine apart from me.... But it was much simpler
41285. really.... It was all very simple and horrible."
41286. 
41287. "When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his
41288. land, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside,
41289. unconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his path,
41290. and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says
41291. it is a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, when he is not
41292. here and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is the trial
41293. intended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I
41294. shall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own
41295. men, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them
41296. did yesterday, and the French will come and take me by head and heels
41297. and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under their noses, and new
41298. conditions of life will arise, which will seem quite ordinary to others
41299. and about which I shall know nothing. I shall not exist..."
41300. 
41301. He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their
41302. motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. "To die... to be
41303. killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still
41304. be, but no me...."
41305. 
41306. And the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the
41307. smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed
41308. terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose
41309. quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.
41310. 
41311. After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. "Who's that?"
41312. he cried.
41313. 
41314. The red-nosed Captain Timokhin, formerly Dolokhov's squadron commander,
41315. but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the
41316. shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.
41317. 
41318. Prince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come
41319. about, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss
41320. them when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.
41321. 
41322. "Devil take it!" said the voice of a man stumbling over something.
41323. 
41324. Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped
41325. over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It was
41326. unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general,
41327. and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of
41328. his last visit to Moscow.
41329. 
41330. "You? What a surprise!" said he. "What brings you here? This is
41331. unexpected!"
41332. 
41333. As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness--they
41334. expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached
41335. the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew's face he felt
41336. constrained and ill at ease.
41337. 
41338. "I have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me," said
41339. Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word
41340. "interesting." "I wish to see the battle."
41341. 
41342. "Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they
41343. stop it?" said Prince Andrew sarcastically. "Well, and how's Moscow? And
41344. my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?" he asked seriously.
41345. 
41346. "Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskaya told me so. I went to see them, but
41347. missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow."
41348. 
41349. 
41350. 
41351. 
41352. 
41353. CHAPTER XXV
41354. 
41355. 
41356. The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently
41357. reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have
41358. tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with
41359. surprise at Pierre's huge stout figure and listened to his talk of
41360. Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince
41361. Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre
41362. addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.
41363. 
41364. "So you understand the whole position of our troops?" Prince Andrew
41365. interrupted him.
41366. 
41367. "Yes--that is, how do you mean?" said Pierre. "Not being a military man
41368. I can't say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general
41369. position."
41370. 
41371. "Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may," said
41372. Prince Andrew.
41373. 
41374. "Oh!" said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince
41375. Andrew. "Well, and what do you think of Kutuzov's appointment?" he
41376. asked.
41377. 
41378. "I was very glad of his appointment, that's all I know," replied Prince
41379. Andrew.
41380. 
41381. "And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying
41382. heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?"
41383. 
41384. "Ask them," replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.
41385. 
41386. Pierre looked at Timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile
41387. with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.
41388. 
41389. "We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your
41390. excellency," said Timokhin timidly, and continually turning to glance at
41391. his colonel.
41392. 
41393. "Why so?" asked Pierre.
41394. 
41395. "Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when
41396. we were retreating from Sventsyani we dare not touch a stick or a wisp
41397. of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all;
41398. wasn't it so, your excellency?" and again Timokhin turned to the prince.
41399. "But we daren't. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for
41400. that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became
41401. straight forward. Now we see light..."
41402. 
41403. "Then why was it forbidden?"
41404. 
41405. Timokhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer
41406. such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.
41407. 
41408. "Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the
41409. enemy," said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. "It is very sound:
41410. one can't permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to
41411. marauding. At Smolensk too he judged correctly that the French might
41412. outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand
41413. this," cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him
41414. involuntarily: "he could not understand that there, for the first time,
41415. we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the
41416. men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for
41417. two days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold. He
41418. ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went for nothing.
41419. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do the best he could,
41420. he thought out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable. He is
41421. unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and
41422. accurately as every German has to. How can I explain?... Well, say your
41423. father has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your
41424. father's requirements better than you could, then it's all right to let
41425. him serve. But if your father is mortally sick you'll send the valet
41426. away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands,
41427. and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could.
41428. So it has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could
41429. serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger
41430. she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been making him
41431. out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the only result will
41432. be that afterwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they will make
41433. him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor, and that will be still
41434. more unjust. He is an honest and very punctilious German."
41435. 
41436. "And they say he's a skillful commander," rejoined Pierre.
41437. 
41438. "I don't understand what is meant by 'a skillful commander,'" replied
41439. Prince Andrew ironically.
41440. 
41441. "A skillful commander?" replied Pierre. "Why, one who foresees all
41442. contingencies... and foresees the adversary's intentions."
41443. 
41444. "But that's impossible," said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter
41445. settled long ago.
41446. 
41447. Pierre looked at him in surprise.
41448. 
41449. "And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?" he remarked.
41450. 
41451. "Yes," replied Prince Andrew, "but with this little difference, that
41452. in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not
41453. limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always
41454. stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while
41455. in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes
41456. weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can
41457. never be known to anyone. Believe me," he went on, "if things
41458. depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making
41459. arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in
41460. the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow's
41461. battle will depend and not on those others.... Success never depends,
41462. and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers,
41463. and least of all on position."
41464. 
41465. "But on what then?"
41466. 
41467. "On the feeling that is in me and in him," he pointed to Timokhin, "and
41468. in each soldier."
41469. 
41470. Prince Andrew glanced at Timokhin, who looked at his commander in alarm
41471. and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity
41472. Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from
41473. expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.
41474. 
41475. "A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose
41476. the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours,
41477. but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle,
41478. and we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for
41479. there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could.
41480. 'We've lost, so let us run,' and we ran. If we had not said that till
41481. the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we
41482. shan't say it! You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the
41483. right flank too extended," he went on. "That's all nonsense, there's
41484. nothing of the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most
41485. diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that
41486. our men or theirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is
41487. killed, but all that is being done at present is only play. The fact is
41488. that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only
41489. do not help matters, but hinder. They are only concerned with their own
41490. petty interests."
41491. 
41492. "At such a moment?" said Pierre reproachfully.
41493. 
41494. "At such a moment!" Prince Andrew repeated. "To them it is only a moment
41495. affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross
41496. or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred
41497. thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and
41498. the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side
41499. that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you
41500. like I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at
41501. the top may make, we shall win tomorrow's battle. Tomorrow, happen what
41502. may, we shall win!"
41503. 
41504. "There now, your excellency! That's the truth, the real truth," said
41505. Timokhin. "Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion,
41506. believe me, wouldn't drink their vodka! 'It's not the day for that!'
41507. they say."
41508. 
41509. All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the shed
41510. with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone
41511. Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation
41512. when they heard the clatter of three horses' hoofs on the road not far
41513. from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince Andrew recognized
41514. Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by
41515. continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these
41516. words:
41517. 
41518. "Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht genug
41519. Preis geben," * said one of them.
41520. 
41521. 
41522.      * "The war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently
41523.      commend that view."
41524. 
41525. 
41526. "Oh, ja," said the other, "der Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwachen,
41527. so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung
41528. nehmen." *
41529. 
41530. 
41531.      * "Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of
41532.      course one cannot take into account the loss of private
41533.      individuals."
41534. 
41535. 
41536. "Oh, no," agreed the other.
41537. 
41538. "Extend widely!" said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had
41539. ridden past. "In that 'extend' were my father, son, and sister, at
41540. Bald Hills. That's all the same to him! That's what I was saying to
41541. you--those German gentlemen won't win the battle tomorrow but will only
41542. make all the mess they can, because they have nothing in their German
41543. heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven't in their
41544. hearts the one thing needed tomorrow--that which Timokhin has. They
41545. have yielded up all Europe to him, and have now come to teach us. Fine
41546. teachers!" and again his voice grew shrill.
41547. 
41548. "So you think we shall win tomorrow's battle?" asked Pierre.
41549. 
41550. "Yes, yes," answered Prince Andrew absently. "One thing I would do if
41551. I had the power," he began again, "I would not take prisoners. Why take
41552. prisoners? It's chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on
41553. their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me
41554. every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals.
41555. And so thinks Timokhin and the whole army. They should be executed!
41556. Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been
41557. said at Tilsit."
41558. 
41559. "Yes, yes," muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew.
41560. "I quite agree with you!"
41561. 
41562. The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozhaysk hill and all
41563. that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now
41564. understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the
41565. impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and
41566. stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up
41567. for him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in
41568. physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen,
41569. and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as
41570. it were lightheartedly.
41571. 
41572. "Not take prisoners," Prince Andrew continued: "That by itself would
41573. quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have
41574. played at war--that's what's vile! We play at magnanimity and all that
41575. stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and
41576. sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she
41577. is so kindhearted that she can't look at blood, but enjoys eating the
41578. calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of
41579. chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It's
41580. all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged
41581. us and we humbugged them. They plunder other people's houses, issue
41582. false paper money, and worst of all they kill my children and my
41583. father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no
41584. prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I have
41585. through the same sufferings..."
41586. 
41587. Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or
41588. not Moscow was taken as Smolensk had been, was suddenly checked in his
41589. speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a
41590. few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips
41591. quivered as he began speaking.
41592. 
41593. "If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only
41594. when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would
41595. not be war because Paul Ivanovich had offended Michael Ivanovich. And
41596. when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the
41597. determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these
41598. Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow
41599. him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia
41600. without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in
41601. life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to
41602. accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in
41603. that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is
41604. now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military
41605. calling is the most highly honored.
41606. 
41607. "But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the
41608. habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war
41609. are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country's
41610. inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud
41611. and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class
41612. are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance,
41613. cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the
41614. highest class, respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese,
41615. wear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the
41616. highest rewards.
41617. 
41618. "They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill
41619. and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for
41620. having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they
41621. announce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed
41622. the greater their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear
41623. them?" exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. "Ah, my
41624. friend, it has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have
41625. begun to understand too much. And it doesn't do for man to taste of the
41626. tree of knowledge of good and evil.... Ah, well, it's not for long!" he
41627. added.
41628. 
41629. "However, you're sleepy, and it's time for me to sleep. Go back to
41630. Gorki!" said Prince Andrew suddenly.
41631. 
41632. "Oh no!" Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,
41633. compassionate eyes.
41634. 
41635. "Go, go! Before a battle one must have one's sleep out," repeated Prince
41636. Andrew.
41637. 
41638. He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. "Good-by, be
41639. off!" he shouted. "Whether we meet again or not..." and turning away
41640. hurriedly he entered the shed.
41641. 
41642. It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the
41643. expression of Prince Andrew's face was angry or tender.
41644. 
41645. For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow
41646. him or go away. "No, he does not want it!" Pierre concluded. "And I know
41647. that this is our last meeting!" He sighed deeply and rode back to Gorki.
41648. 
41649. On re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he could
41650. not sleep.
41651. 
41652. He closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On
41653. one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening
41654. in Petersburg. Natasha with animated and excited face was telling him
41655. how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost
41656. her way in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of
41657. the forest, her feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and
41658. constantly interrupted her story to say: "No, I can't! I'm not telling
41659. it right; no, you don't understand," though he encouraged her by saying
41660. that he did understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to
41661. say. But Natasha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that
41662. they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced
41663. that day and wished to convey. "He was such a delightful old man, and
41664. it was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I can't
41665. describe it," she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew smiled
41666. now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes. "I
41667. understood her," he thought. "I not only understood her, but it was
41668. just that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that frankness of
41669. soul--that very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body--it
41670. was that soul I loved in her... loved so strongly and happily..." and
41671. suddenly he remembered how his love had ended. "He did not need anything
41672. of that kind. He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort. He
41673. only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did not
41674. deign to unite his fate. And I?... and he is still alive and gay!"
41675. 
41676. Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began
41677. pacing up and down in front of the shed.
41678. 
41679. 
41680. 
41681. 
41682. 
41683. CHAPTER XXVI
41684. 
41685. 
41686. On August 25, the eve of the battle of Borodino, M. de Beausset, prefect
41687. of the French Emperor's palace, arrived at Napoleon's quarters at
41688. Valuevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the latter from
41689. Madrid.
41690. 
41691. Donning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had
41692. brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first
41693. compartment of Napoleon's tent, where he began opening the box while
41694. conversing with Napoleon's aides-de-camp who surrounded him.
41695. 
41696. Fabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking to some
41697. generals of his acquaintance.
41698. 
41699. The Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his
41700. toilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and
41701. now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing
41702. him down. Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle,
41703. was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor's pampered body with an
41704. expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau
41705. de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon's short hair was wet and
41706. matted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed
41707. physical satisfaction. "Go on, harder, go on!" he muttered to the valet
41708. who was rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp,
41709. who had entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of
41710. prisoners taken in yesterday's action, was standing by the door after
41711. delivering his message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon,
41712. frowning, looked at him from under his brows.
41713. 
41714. "No prisoners!" said he, repeating the aide-de-camp's words. "They
41715. are forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the Russian
41716. army.... Go on... harder, harder!" he muttered, hunching his back and
41717. presenting his fat shoulders.
41718. 
41719. "All right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too," he said,
41720. nodding to the aide-de-camp.
41721. 
41722. "Yes, sire," and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the
41723. tent.
41724. 
41725. Two valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of
41726. the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.
41727. 
41728. De Beausset's hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present
41729. he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in front of the
41730. entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected
41731. rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.
41732. 
41733. Napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were
41734. not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him
41735. a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to
41736. him, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him
41737. of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at
41738. the other end of Europe, with but one thought--to be worthy of their
41739. Emperor--and but one fear--to fail to please him. The result of
41740. that battle had been deplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during
41741. Fabvier's account, as if he had not expected that matters could go
41742. otherwise in his absence.
41743. 
41744. "I must make up for that in Moscow," said Napoleon. "I'll see you
41745. later," he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had
41746. prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered
41747. it with a cloth.
41748. 
41749. De Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the
41750. old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,
41751. presenting an envelope.
41752. 
41753. Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.
41754. 
41755. "You have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?" he
41756. asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial
41757. tone.
41758. 
41759. "Sire, all Paris regrets your absence," replied de Beausset as was
41760. proper.
41761. 
41762. But though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this
41763. kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was
41764. pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching his ear.
41765. 
41766. "I am very sorry to have made you travel so far," said he.
41767. 
41768. "Sire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,"
41769. replied de Beausset.
41770. 
41771. Napoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the
41772. right. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a
41773. gold snuffbox, which he took.
41774. 
41775. "Yes, it has happened luckily for you," he said, raising the open
41776. snuffbox to his nose. "You are fond of travel, and in three days you
41777. will see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital.
41778. You will have a pleasant journey."
41779. 
41780. De Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of
41781. which he had not till then been aware).
41782. 
41783. "Ha, what's this?" asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were
41784. looking at something concealed under a cloth.
41785. 
41786. With courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his
41787. back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the
41788. same time, and said:
41789. 
41790. "A present to Your Majesty from the Empress."
41791. 
41792. It was a portrait, painted in bright colors by Gerard, of the son borne
41793. to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for
41794. some reason everyone called "The King of Rome."
41795. 
41796. A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine
41797. Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the
41798. terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.
41799. 
41800. Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting
41801. the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory
41802. apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in
41803. Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.
41804. 
41805. "The King of Rome!" he said, pointing to the portrait with a graceful
41806. gesture. "Admirable!"
41807. 
41808. With the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of
41809. his face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look
41810. of pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said and did would
41811. be historical, and it seemed to him that it would now be best for
41812. him--whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the
41813. terrestrial globe--to show, in contrast to that grandeur, the simplest
41814. paternal tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward, glanced round
41815. at a chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and sat down on it
41816. before the portrait. At a single gesture from him everyone went out on
41817. tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and his emotion.
41818. 
41819. Having sat still for a while he touched--himself not knowing why--the
41820. thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait,
41821. rose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the
41822. portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed
41823. round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of
41824. Rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.
41825. 
41826. And while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with
41827. him, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the
41828. officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.
41829. 
41830. "Vive l'Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l'Empereur!" came those
41831. ecstatic cries.
41832. 
41833. After breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset's presence dictated his order of
41834. the day to the army.
41835. 
41836. "Short and energetic!" he remarked when he had read over the
41837. proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It
41838. ran:
41839. 
41840. 
41841. Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends on
41842. you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable
41843. quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you did at
41844. Austerlitz, Friedland, Vitebsk, and Smolensk. Let our remotest posterity
41845. recall your achievements this day with pride. Let it be said of each of
41846. you: "He was in the great battle before Moscow!"
41847. 
41848. 
41849. "Before Moscow!" repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who was
41850. so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent
41851. to where the horses stood saddled.
41852. 
41853. "Your Majesty is too kind!" replied de Beausset to the invitation to
41854. accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and
41855. was afraid of doing so.
41856. 
41857. But Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount. When
41858. Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before his
41859. son's portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.
41860. 
41861. "Take him away!" he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to
41862. the portrait. "It is too soon for him to see a field of battle."
41863. 
41864. De Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to
41865. indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor's words.
41866. 
41867. 
41868. 
41869. 
41870. 
41871. CHAPTER XXVII
41872. 
41873. 
41874. On the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon spent
41875. the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, considering plans
41876. submitted to him by his marshals, and personally giving commands to his
41877. generals.
41878. 
41879. The original line of the Russian forces along the river Kolocha had
41880. been dislocated by the capture of the Shevardino Redoubt on the
41881. twenty-fourth, and part of the line--the left flank--had been drawn
41882. back. That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the
41883. ground was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone,
41884. military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It would
41885. seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion,
41886. nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his
41887. marshals, nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality
41888. called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to Napoleon; yet the
41889. historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded
41890. Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.
41891. 
41892. Napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound
41893. air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously,
41894. and without communicating to the generals around him the profound
41895. course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final
41896. conclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a suggestion
41897. from Davout, who was now called Prince d'Eckmuhl, to turn the Russian
41898. left wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without explaining
41899. why not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to attack the
41900. fleches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though
41901. the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement
41902. through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.
41903. 
41904. Having inspected the country opposite the Shevardino Redoubt, Napoleon
41905. pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two
41906. batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the Russian
41907. entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field
41908. artillery should be placed.
41909. 
41910. After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the
41911. dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.
41912. 
41913. These dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm
41914. and other historians with profound respect, were as follows:
41915. 
41916. 
41917. At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the
41918. plain occupied by the Prince d'Eckmuhl will open fire on the opposing
41919. batteries of the enemy.
41920. 
41921. At the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps,
41922. General Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan's division and all the
41923. howitzers of Dessaix's and Friant's divisions, will move forward, open
41924. fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy's battery, against which
41925. will operate:
41926. 
41927.         24 guns of the artillery of the Guards
41928.         30 guns of Campan's division
41929. 
41930.  and     8 guns of Friant's and Dessaix's divisions
41931.         --
41932. 
41933.  in all 62 guns.
41934. 
41935. 
41936. The commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouche, will
41937. place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the
41938. flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left,
41939. which will have forty guns in all directed against it.
41940. 
41941. General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the
41942. howitzers of the Guard's artillery against either one or other of the
41943. entrenchments.
41944. 
41945. During the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the wood
41946. on the village and turn the enemy's position.
41947. 
41948. General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first
41949. fortification.
41950. 
41951. After the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in
41952. accordance with the enemy's movements.
41953. 
41954. The cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the
41955. right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand's division and of
41956. the vice-King's division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack
41957. commence on the right wing.
41958. 
41959. The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges,
41960. advancing to the same heights as Morand's and Gibrard's divisions, which
41961. under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into
41962. line with the rest of the forces.
41963. 
41964. All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et
41965. methode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.
41966. 
41967. The Imperial Camp near Mozhaysk,
41968. 
41969. September, 6, 1812.
41970. 
41971. 
41972. 
41973. These dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows
41974. oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius,
41975. related to Napoleon's orders to deal with four points--four different
41976. orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.
41977. 
41978. In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the
41979. spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouche; which
41980. were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and
41981. shower shells on the Russian fleches and redoubts. This could not be
41982. done, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not
41983. carry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until
41984. the nearest commander, contrary to Napoleon's instructions, moved them
41985. forward.
41986. 
41987. The second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through the
41988. wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done and
41989. was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village through the
41990. wood, met Tuchkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn
41991. the Russian position.
41992. 
41993. The third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to seize
41994. the first fortification. General Campan's division did not seize the
41995. first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood
41996. it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.
41997. 
41998. The fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village (Borodino)
41999. and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as
42000. Morand's and Gdrard's divisions (for whose movements no directions are
42001. given), which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt
42002. and come into line with the rest of the forces.
42003. 
42004. As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible
42005. sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders
42006. given him, he was to advance from the left through Borodino to the
42007. redoubt while the divisions of Morand and Gerard were to advance
42008. simultaneously from the front.
42009. 
42010. All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could
42011. not be executed. After passing through Borodino the vice-King was driven
42012. back to the Kolocha and could get no farther; while the divisions of
42013. Morand and Gerard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the
42014. redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing
42015. probably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of
42016. the orders in the disposition was, or could be, executed. But in the
42017. disposition it is said that, after the fight has commenced in this
42018. manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy's movements,
42019. and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be
42020. made by Napoleon during the battle. But this was not and could not be
42021. done, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as
42022. appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one
42023. of his orders during the fight could be executed.
42024. 
42025. 
42026. 
42027. 
42028. 
42029. CHAPTER XXVIII
42030. 
42031. 
42032. Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodino
42033. because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the
42034. orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more
42035. full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world
42036. have been changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped by
42037. the will of one man--Peter the Great--and that France from a republic
42038. became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one
42039. man--Napoleon--to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon
42040. had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and
42041. convincing.
42042. 
42043. If it had depended on Napoleon's will to fight or not to fight the
42044. battle of Borodino, and if this or that other arrangement depended on
42045. his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will
42046. might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring
42047. Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been
42048. the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is
42049. indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest
42050. (without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre
42051. of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IX's stomach being deranged. But
42052. to men who do not admit that Russia was formed by the will of one man,
42053. Peter I, or that the French Empire was formed and the war with Russia
42054. begun by the will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not merely
42055. untrue and irrational, but contrary to all human reality. To the
42056. question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself,
42057. namely, that the course of human events is predetermined from on
42058. high--depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part
42059. in the events, and that a Napoleon's influence on the course of these
42060. events is purely external and fictitious.
42061. 
42062. Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of
42063. St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX's will, though he gave the
42064. order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and
42065. strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand
42066. men at Borodino was not due to Napoleon's will, though he ordered the
42067. commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done
42068. because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear, yet human
42069. dignity--which tells me that each of us is, if not more at least not
42070. less a man than the great Napoleon--demands the acceptance of that
42071. solution of the question, and historic investigation abundantly confirms
42072. it.
42073. 
42074. At the battle of Borodino Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.
42075. That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who killed
42076. people.
42077. 
42078. The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of Borodino
42079. not because of Napoleon's orders but by their own volition. The whole
42080. army--French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch--hungry, ragged, and
42081. weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road
42082. to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then
42083. forbidden them to fight the Russians, they would have killed him and
42084. have proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable.
42085. 
42086. When they heard Napoleon's proclamation offering them, as compensation
42087. for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been
42088. in the battle before Moscow, they cried "Vive l'Empereur!" just as they
42089. had cried "Vive l'Empereur!" at the sight of the portrait of the boy
42090. piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would
42091. have cried "Vive l'Empereur!" at any nonsense that might be told them.
42092. There was nothing left for them to do but cry "Vive l'Empereur!" and go
42093. to fight, in order to get food and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it
42094. was not because of Napoleon's commands that they killed their fellow
42095. men.
42096. 
42097. And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none
42098. of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what
42099. was going on before him. So the way in which these people killed one
42100. another was not decided by Napoleon's will but occurred independently of
42101. him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took
42102. part in the common action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took
42103. place by his will. And so the question whether he had or had not a
42104. cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the
42105. transport soldiers.
42106. 
42107. Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was
42108. the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on former
42109. occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as
42110. previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon's cold on
42111. the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.
42112. 
42113. The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even
42114. better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. His
42115. pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, but
42116. much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse
42117. than previous ones because the battle of Borodino was the first Napoleon
42118. did not win. The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders
42119. seem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks
42120. of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the
42121. very worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people
42122. fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a
42123. battle that has been won.
42124. 
42125. The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were
42126. a model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were
42127. criticized--criticized for their very perfection, for their excessive
42128. minuteness.
42129. 
42130. Napoleon at the battle of Borodino fulfilled his office as
42131. representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other
42132. battles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he
42133. inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not
42134. contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of
42135. battle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his
42136. role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.
42137. 
42138. 
42139. 
42140. 
42141. 
42142. CHAPTER XXIX
42143. 
42144. 
42145. On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:
42146. 
42147. "The chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!"
42148. 
42149. Having ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to him
42150. about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empress'
42151. household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details
42152. relating to the court.
42153. 
42154. He showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset's love of
42155. travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who
42156. knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron
42157. while a patient is being strapped to the operating table. "The matter is
42158. in my hands and is clear and definite in my head. When the time comes to
42159. set to work I shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and
42160. the more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you
42161. ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius."
42162. 
42163. Having finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before
42164. the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. He
42165. was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and
42166. in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the
42167. evening, he went into the large division of the tent at three o'clock in
42168. the morning, loudly blowing his nose. He asked whether the Russians had
42169. not withdrawn, and was told that the enemy's fires were still in the
42170. same places. He nodded approval.
42171. 
42172. The adjutant in attendance came into the tent.
42173. 
42174. "Well, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?" Napoleon
42175. asked him.
42176. 
42177. "Without doubt, sire," replied Rapp.
42178. 
42179. Napoleon looked at him.
42180. 
42181. "Do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at Smolensk?"
42182. continued Rapp. "The wine is drawn and must be drunk."
42183. 
42184. Napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his
42185. hand.
42186. 
42187. "This poor army!" he suddenly remarked. "It has diminished greatly since
42188. Smolensk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so
42189. and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards
42190. are intact?" he remarked interrogatively.
42191. 
42192. "Yes, sire," replied Rapp.
42193. 
42194. Napoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch.
42195. He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was impossible
42196. to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had
42197. all been given and were now being executed.
42198. 
42199. "Have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the
42200. Guards?" asked Napoleon sternly.
42201. 
42202. "Yes, sire."
42203. 
42204. "The rice too?"
42205. 
42206. Rapp replied that he had given the Emperor's order about the rice, but
42207. Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that
42208. his order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch. Napoleon
42209. ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently sipped his
42210. own.
42211. 
42212. "I have neither taste nor smell," he remarked, sniffing at his glass.
42213. "This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine--what is the good of
42214. medicine when it can't cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but
42215. they don't help at all. What can doctors cure? One can't cure anything.
42216. Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its
42217. nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it
42218. will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies.
42219. Our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the
42220. watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that
42221. blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all."
42222. 
42223. And having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond,
42224. Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.
42225. 
42226. "Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?" asked he. "It is the art of
42227. being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That's all."
42228. 
42229. Rapp made no reply.
42230. 
42231. "Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutuzov!" said Napoleon. "We shall
42232. see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks
42233. and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... We shall
42234. see!"
42235. 
42236. He looked at his watch. It was still only four o'clock. He did not feel
42237. sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do. He
42238. rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went
42239. out of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible
42240. moisture was descending from above. Near by, the campfires were dimly
42241. burning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of the
42242. Russian line shone through the smoke. The weather was calm, and the
42243. rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to take
42244. up their positions were clearly audible.
42245. 
42246. Napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and
42247. listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in
42248. a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn
42249. himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped
42250. in front of him.
42251. 
42252. "What year did you enter the service?" he asked with that affectation
42253. of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the
42254. soldiers.
42255. 
42256. The man answered the question.
42257. 
42258. "Ah! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?"
42259. 
42260. "It has, Your Majesty."
42261. 
42262. Napoleon nodded and walked away.
42263. 
42264. 
42265. At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevardino.
42266. 
42267. It was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in
42268. the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the
42269. faint morning light.
42270. 
42271. On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in
42272. the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a third report
42273. shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the
42274. right.
42275. 
42276. The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out
42277. and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.
42278. 
42279. Napoleon with his suite rode up to the Shevardino Redoubt where he
42280. dismounted. The game had begun.
42281. 
42282. 
42283. 
42284. 
42285. 
42286. CHAPTER XXX
42287. 
42288. 
42289. On returning to Gorki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre ordered
42290. his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning,
42291. and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner Boris
42292. had given up to him.
42293. 
42294. Before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left
42295. the hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was
42296. shaking him.
42297. 
42298. "Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!" he kept repeating
42299. pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at
42300. him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.
42301. 
42302. "What? Has it begun? Is it time?" Pierre asked, waking up.
42303. 
42304. "Hear the firing," said the groom, a discharged soldier. "All the
42305. gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past long
42306. ago."
42307. 
42308. Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was bright,
42309. fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from behind a
42310. cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still half broken
42311. by the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on the
42312. dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on the
42313. windows, the fence, and on Pierre's horses standing before the hut. The
42314. roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a
42315. Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.
42316. 
42317. "It's time, Count; it's time!" cried the adjutant.
42318. 
42319. Telling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the
42320. street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the
42321. day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the
42322. staff could be heard conversing in French, and Kutuzov's gray head in
42323. a white cap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his
42324. shoulders. He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before
42325. him.
42326. 
42327. Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him,
42328. spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired from that
42329. spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and
42330. covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the
42331. bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it
42332. through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden tinted
42333. light and long dark shadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of
42334. the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green
42335. color; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and
42336. was pierced beyond Valuevo by the Smolensk highroad crowded with troops.
42337. Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses.
42338. There were troops to be seen everywhere, in front and to the right and
42339. left. All this was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed
42340. Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodino
42341. and the hollows on both sides of the Kolocha.
42342. 
42343. Above the Kolocha, in Borodino and on both sides of it, especially to
42344. the left where the Voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into
42345. the Kolocha, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to
42346. become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored
42347. and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist,
42348. and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning
42349. sun were reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from
42350. the dew, and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the
42351. riverbanks and in Borodino. A white church could be seen through the
42352. mist, and here and there the roofs of huts in Borodino as well as dense
42353. masses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests and ordnance. And all
42354. this moved, or seemed to move, as the smoke and mist spread out over
42355. the whole space. Just as in the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodino, so
42356. along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods
42357. and fields to the left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high
42358. ground, clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of
42359. nothing, now singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others
42360. dense, which, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over
42361. the whole expanse.
42362. 
42363. These puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of the firing
42364. produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.
42365. 
42366. "Puff!"--suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from
42367. violet into gray and milky white, and "boom!" came the report a second
42368. later.
42369. 
42370. "Puff! puff!"--and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending
42371. together; and "boom, boom!" came the sounds confirming what the eye had
42372. seen.
42373. 
42374. Pierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a round
42375. compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating
42376. to one side, and--"puff" (with a pause)--"puff, puff!" three and
42377. then four more appeared and then from each, with the same
42378. interval--"boom--boom, boom!" came the fine, firm, precise sounds in
42379. reply. It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes
42380. stood still while woods, fields, and glittering bayonets ran past them.
42381. From the left, over fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were
42382. continually appearing followed by their solemn reports, while nearer
42383. still, in the hollows and woods, there burst from the muskets small
42384. cloudlets that had no time to become balls, but had their little echoes
42385. in just the same way. "Trakh-ta-ta-takh!" came the frequent crackle of
42386. musketry, but it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports
42387. of the cannon.
42388. 
42389. Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, that
42390. movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutuzov and his suite,
42391. to compare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking
42392. at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the
42393. same feelings. All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth
42394. of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood
42395. after his talk with Prince Andrew.
42396. 
42397. "Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!" Kutuzov was
42398. saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the
42399. battlefield.
42400. 
42401. Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down
42402. the knoll.
42403. 
42404. "To the crossing!" said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one
42405. of the staff who asked where he was going.
42406. 
42407. "I'll go there too, I too!" thought Pierre, and followed the general.
42408. 
42409. The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to
42410. his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest,
42411. clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes
42412. pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles
42413. were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he
42414. galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to smile as they
42415. watched him from the knoll.
42416. 
42417. 
42418. 
42419. 
42420. 
42421. CHAPTER XXXI
42422. 
42423. 
42424. Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping
42425. turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped
42426. in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass
42427. either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers
42428. everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with
42429. some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same
42430. dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat,
42431. who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse's
42432. hoofs.
42433. 
42434. "Why ride into the middle of the battalion?" one of them shouted at him.
42435. 
42436. Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,
42437. bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse,
42438. galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.
42439. 
42440. There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing.
42441. Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the
42442. bridge across the Kolocha between Gorki and Borodino, which the French
42443. (having occupied Borodino) were attacking in the first phase of the
42444. battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that
42445. soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow,
42446. among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the
42447. smoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing
42448. going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did
42449. not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the
42450. projectiles that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side
42451. of the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded,
42452. though many fell near him. He looked about him with a smile which did
42453. not leave his face.
42454. 
42455. "Why's that fellow in front of the line?" shouted somebody at him again.
42456. 
42457. "To the left!... Keep to the right!" the men shouted to him.
42458. 
42459. Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of Raevski's
42460. adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently
42461. also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.
42462. 
42463. "How have you got here?" he said, and galloped on.
42464. 
42465. Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of
42466. getting in someone's way again, galloped after the adjutant.
42467. 
42468. "What's happening here? May I come with you?" he asked.
42469. 
42470. "One moment, one moment!" replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout
42471. colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and
42472. then addressed Pierre.
42473. 
42474. "Why have you come here, Count?" he asked with a smile. "Still
42475. inquisitive?"
42476. 
42477. "Yes, yes," assented Pierre.
42478. 
42479. But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.
42480. 
42481. "Here it's tolerable," said he, "but with Bagration on the left flank
42482. they're getting it frightfully hot."
42483. 
42484. "Really?" said Pierre. "Where is that?"
42485. 
42486. "Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in
42487. our battery it is still bearable," said the adjutant. "Will you come?"
42488. 
42489. "Yes, I'll come with you," replied Pierre, looking round for his groom.
42490. 
42491. It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being
42492. carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day
42493. before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his
42494. head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.
42495. 
42496. "Why haven't they carried him away?" Pierre was about to ask, but seeing
42497. the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he
42498. checked himself.
42499. 
42500. Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the
42501. adjutant to Raevski's Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutant's
42502. and jolted him at every step.
42503. 
42504. "You don't seem to be used to riding, Count?" remarked the adjutant.
42505. 
42506. "No it's not that, but her action seems so jerky," said Pierre in a
42507. puzzled tone.
42508. 
42509. "Why... she's wounded!" said the adjutant. "In the off foreleg above the
42510. knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of
42511. fire!"
42512. 
42513. Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery
42514. which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the
42515. noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet,
42516. with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up
42517. the hill on foot.
42518. 
42519. "Is the general here?" asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.
42520. 
42521. "He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way," someone told him,
42522. pointing to the right.
42523. 
42524. The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.
42525. 
42526. "Don't trouble about me," said Pierre. "I'll go up onto the knoll if I
42527. may?"
42528. 
42529. "Yes, do. You'll see everything from there and it's less dangerous, and
42530. I'll come for you."
42531. 
42532. Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet
42533. again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that
42534. day.
42535. 
42536. The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known
42537. to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raevski's Redoubt, and to the
42538. French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre,
42539. around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as
42540. the key to the whole position.
42541. 
42542. This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had
42543. been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired
42544. through openings in the earthwork.
42545. 
42546. In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired
42547. incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending
42548. that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches
42549. had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most
42550. important point of the battle.
42551. 
42552. On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one
42553. of the least significant parts of the field.
42554. 
42555. Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench
42556. surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with
42557. an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about the
42558. battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers
42559. who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past
42560. him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being fired
42561. continually one after another with a deafening roar, enveloping the
42562. whole neighborhood in powder smoke.
42563. 
42564. In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support,
42565. here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were
42566. separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and
42567. as it were family feeling of animation.
42568. 
42569. The intrusion of Pierre's nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an
42570. unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with
42571. surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior artillery
42572. officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if
42573. to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity.
42574. 
42575. A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just
42576. out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns
42577. entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.
42578. 
42579. "Sir," he said, "permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be
42580. here."
42581. 
42582. The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre.
42583. But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat
42584. was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench
42585. with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up
42586. and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard,
42587. their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a
42588. kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs,
42589. cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the
42590. regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him,
42591. gave him a nickname ("our gentleman"), and made kindly fun of him among
42592. themselves.
42593. 
42594. A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around
42595. with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.
42596. 
42597. "And how's it you're not afraid, sir, really now?" a red-faced,
42598. broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set
42599. of sound, white teeth.
42600. 
42601. "Are you afraid, then?" said Pierre.
42602. 
42603. "What else do you expect?" answered the soldier. "She has no mercy, you
42604. know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One can't
42605. help being afraid," he said laughing.
42606. 
42607. Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre.
42608. They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the
42609. discovery that he did so delighted them.
42610. 
42611. "It's the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it's wonderful!
42612. There's a gentleman for you!"
42613. 
42614. "To your places!" cried the young officer to the men gathered round
42615. Pierre.
42616. 
42617. The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or
42618. second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with
42619. great precision and formality.
42620. 
42621. The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more
42622. intense over the whole field, especially to the left where Bagration's
42623. fleches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it
42624. almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole attention
42625. was engrossed by watching the family circle--separated from all
42626. else--formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling
42627. of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield
42628. was now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier
42629. lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he
42630. observed the faces of those around him.
42631. 
42632. By ten o'clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the
42633. battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more
42634. frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around.
42635. But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices
42636. and jokes were heard on all sides.
42637. 
42638. "A live one!" shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.
42639. 
42640. "Not this way! To the infantry!" added another with loud laughter,
42641. seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.
42642. 
42643. "Are you bowing to a friend, eh?" remarked another, chaffing a peasant
42644. who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.
42645. 
42646. Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see
42647. what was happening in front.
42648. 
42649. "They've withdrawn the front line, it has retired," said they, pointing
42650. over the earthwork.
42651. 
42652. "Mind your own business," an old sergeant shouted at them. "If they've
42653. retired it's because there's work for them to do farther back."
42654. 
42655. And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a
42656. shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.
42657. 
42658. "To the fifth gun, wheel it up!" came shouts from one side.
42659. 
42660. "Now then, all together, like bargees!" rose the merry voices of those
42661. who were moving the gun.
42662. 
42663. "Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman's hat off!" cried the red-faced
42664. humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. "Awkward baggage!" he added
42665. reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man's
42666. leg.
42667. 
42668. "Now then, you foxes!" said another, laughing at some militiamen who,
42669. stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.
42670. 
42671. "So this gruel isn't to your taste? Oh, you crows! You're scared!" they
42672. shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg
42673. had been torn off.
42674. 
42675. "There, lads... oh, oh!" they mimicked the peasants, "they don't like it
42676. at all!"
42677. 
42678. Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after
42679. every loss, the liveliness increased more and more.
42680. 
42681. As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and
42682. rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to
42683. what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and
42684. more intense glowed in the faces of these men.
42685. 
42686. Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know
42687. what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire
42688. which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the
42689. same way in his own soul.
42690. 
42691. At ten o'clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of
42692. the battery and along the Kamenka streamlet retreated. From the battery
42693. they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on
42694. their muskets. A general with his suite came to the battery, and after
42695. speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again
42696. having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down,
42697. so as to be less exposed to fire. After this from amid the ranks of
42698. infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts
42699. of command, and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry
42700. moved forward.
42701. 
42702. Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck
42703. by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking
42704. backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.
42705. 
42706. The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their
42707. long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few
42708. minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from
42709. that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the
42710. battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed. Around
42711. the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No one any
42712. longer took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being
42713. in the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid strides from one
42714. gun to another with a frowning face. The young officer, with his face
42715. still more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The
42716. soldiers handed up the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business
42717. with strained smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as
42718. though they were on springs.
42719. 
42720. The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which
42721. Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the
42722. commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to
42723. his superior.
42724. 
42725. "I have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are
42726. we to continue firing?" he asked.
42727. 
42728. "Grapeshot!" the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking
42729. over the wall of the trench.
42730. 
42731. Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending
42732. double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything
42733. became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre's eyes.
42734. 
42735. One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a
42736. soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before,
42737. now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting
42738. "Hurrah!" were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre.
42739. 
42740. A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was
42741. standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes
42742. and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were
42743. entering the battery ran back.
42744. 
42745. "All with grapeshot!" shouted the officer.
42746. 
42747. The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed
42748. him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of
42749. some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.
42750. 
42751. "The scoundrels! What are they doing?" shouted the officer, turning to
42752. Pierre.
42753. 
42754. The officer's face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under
42755. his frowning brow.
42756. 
42757. "Run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!" he yelled,
42758. angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.
42759. 
42760. "I'll go," said Pierre.
42761. 
42762. The officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite side.
42763. 
42764. "Don't fire.... Wait!" he shouted.
42765. 
42766. The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against
42767. Pierre.
42768. 
42769. "Eh, sir, this is no place for you," said he, and ran down the slope.
42770. 
42771. Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was
42772. sitting.
42773. 
42774. One cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in front,
42775. beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. "Where am I going?"
42776. he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition
42777. wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on.
42778. Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground. At the
42779. same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a
42780. deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle.
42781. 
42782. When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his
42783. hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed,
42784. only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a
42785. horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while
42786. another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and
42787. piercing cries.
42788. 
42789. 
42790. 
42791. 
42792. 
42793. CHAPTER XXXII
42794. 
42795. 
42796. Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery,
42797. as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.
42798. 
42799. On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something
42800. there but that no shots were being fired from the battery. He had no
42801. time to realize who these men were. He saw the senior officer lying on
42802. the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something
42803. down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was
42804. struggling forward shouting "Brothers!" and trying to free himself from
42805. some men who were holding him by the arm. He also saw something else
42806. that was strange.
42807. 
42808. But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that
42809. the soldier shouting "Brothers!" was a prisoner, and that another man
42810. had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run
42811. into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue
42812. uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something. Instinctively
42813. guarding against the shock--for they had been running together at full
42814. speed before they saw one another--Pierre put out his hands and seized
42815. the man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one hand and by the
42816. throat with the other. The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by
42817. his collar.
42818. 
42819. For some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another's
42820. unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and
42821. what they were to do next. "Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him
42822. prisoner?" each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently more
42823. inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre's strong
42824. hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and
42825. tighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when just above their
42826. heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre
42827. that the French officer's head had been torn off, so swiftly had he
42828. ducked it.
42829. 
42830. Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further thought
42831. as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery
42832. and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who,
42833. it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he reached the foot
42834. of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who,
42835. stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward
42836. the battery. (This was the attack for which Ermolov claimed the credit,
42837. declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible:
42838. it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some St. George's
42839. Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to
42840. take who got there.)
42841. 
42842. The French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops shouting
42843. "Hurrah!" pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult
42844. to call them back.
42845. 
42846. The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was
42847. a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds of
42848. wounded--some known to Pierre and some unknown--Russians and French,
42849. with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried on
42850. stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto the knoll where
42851. he had spent over an hour, and of that family circle which had received
42852. him as a member he did not find a single one. There were many dead whom
42853. he did not know, but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in
42854. the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth
42855. wall. The red-faced man was still twitching, but they did not carry him
42856. away.
42857. 
42858. Pierre ran down the slope once more.
42859. 
42860. "Now they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have
42861. done!" he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers
42862. moving from the battlefield.
42863. 
42864. But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and
42865. especially to the left, near Semenovsk, something seemed to be seething
42866. in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but
42867. even increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks
42868. with all his remaining strength.
42869. 
42870. 
42871. 
42872. 
42873. 
42874. CHAPTER XXXIII
42875. 
42876. 
42877. The chief action of the battle of Borodino was fought within the seven
42878. thousand feet between Borodino and Bagration's fleches. Beyond that
42879. space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians
42880. with Uvarov's cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond Utitsa,
42881. Poniatowski's collision with Tuchkov; but these two were detached and
42882. feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the
42883. battlefield. On the field between Borodino and the fleches, beside the
42884. wood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible
42885. from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.
42886. 
42887. The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred
42888. guns.
42889. 
42890. Then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,
42891. Campan's and Dessaix's, advanced from the French right, while Murat's
42892. troops advanced on Borodino from their left.
42893. 
42894. From the Shevardino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the fleches were
42895. two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies
42896. to Borodino, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there,
42897. especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality.
42898. The soldiers of Dessaix's division advancing against the fleches could
42899. only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and
42900. the fleches. As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke
42901. of the guns and musketry on the fleches grew so dense that it covered
42902. the whole approach on that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could
42903. be caught of something black--probably men--and at times the glint of
42904. bayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were
42905. French or Russian, could not be discovered from the Shevardino Redoubt.
42906. 
42907. The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into
42908. Napoleon's face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at the
42909. fleches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if
42910. the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved. Sometimes shouts
42911. were heard through the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was
42912. being done there.
42913. 
42914. Napoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in
42915. its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes
42916. Russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could not tell
42917. where what he had seen was.
42918. 
42919. He descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.
42920. 
42921. Occasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at
42922. the battlefield.
42923. 
42924. But not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where
42925. he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which some of his
42926. generals had taken their stand, but even from the fleches themselves--in
42927. which by this time there were now Russian and now French soldiers,
42928. alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or
42929. maddened--even at those fleches themselves it was impossible to make out
42930. what was taking place. There for several hours amid incessant cannon and
42931. musketry fire, now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now
42932. infantry, and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not
42933. knowing what to do with one another, screamed, and ran back again.
42934. 
42935. From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his
42936. marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress
42937. of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was
42938. impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given
42939. moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place
42940. of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also
42941. because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon
42942. circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming
42943. false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that
42944. Borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the Kolocha was in the
42945. hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the
42946. troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up
42947. on the farther side and wait. But before that order was given--almost
42948. as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodino--the bridge had been
42949. retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which Pierre
42950. had been present at the beginning of the battle.
42951. 
42952. An adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and frightened face
42953. and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, Campan
42954. wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been
42955. told that the French had been repulsed, the fleches had in fact been
42956. recaptured by other French troops, and Davout was alive and only
42957. slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy
42958. reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either been executed before
42959. he gave them or could not be and were not executed.
42960. 
42961. The marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle
42962. but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only
42963. occasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements
42964. without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to
42965. fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even
42966. their orders, like Napoleon's, were seldom carried out, and then but
42967. partially. For the most part things happened contrary to their orders.
42968. Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers
42969. ordered to remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians
42970. unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward,
42971. and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians.
42972. In this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the Semenovsk hollow
42973. and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and
42974. galloped full speed back again. The infantry moved in the same way,
42975. sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to
42976. go to. All orders as to where and when to move the guns, when to send
42977. infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantry--all
42978. such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the
42979. units concerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less
42980. Napoleon. They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling
42981. orders or for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at
42982. stake is what is dearest to man--his own life--and it sometimes seems
42983. that safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and
42984. these men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to
42985. the mood of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward
42986. and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops. All
42987. their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the harm of
42988. disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over
42989. the fields on which these men were floundering about. As soon as they
42990. left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about, their
42991. superiors, located in the background, re-formed them and brought them
42992. under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them
42993. back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death
42994. they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance
42995. promptings of the throng.
42996. 
42997. 
42998. 
42999. 
43000. 
43001. CHAPTER XXXIV
43002. 
43003. 
43004. Napoleon's generals--Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that region
43005. of fire and sometimes even entered it--repeatedly led into it huge
43006. masses of well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always happened
43007. in their former battles, instead of the news they expected of the
43008. enemy's flight, these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized
43009. and terrified mobs. The generals re-formed them, but their numbers
43010. constantly decreased. In the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant
43011. to Napoleon to demand reinforcements.
43012. 
43013. Napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when Murat's
43014. adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would be routed
43015. if His Majesty would let him have another division.
43016. 
43017. "Reinforcements?" said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at
43018. the adjutant--a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Murat's
43019. own--as though he did not understand his words.
43020. 
43021. "Reinforcements!" thought Napoleon to himself. "How can they need
43022. reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a
43023. weak, unentrenched Russian wing?"
43024. 
43025. "Tell the King of Naples," said he sternly, "that it is not noon yet,
43026. and I don't yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!..."
43027. 
43028. The handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without
43029. removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being
43030. slaughtered.
43031. 
43032. Napoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began
43033. talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.
43034. 
43035. In the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest
43036. Napoleon, Berthier's eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who
43037. was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard.
43038. Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in
43039. a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending
43040. reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the
43041. Emperor would give another division.
43042. 
43043. Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down
43044. without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the
43045. generals of the suite around him.
43046. 
43047. "You are very fiery, Belliard," said Napoleon, when he again came up to
43048. the general. "In the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake. Go
43049. and have another look and then come back to me."
43050. 
43051. Before Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the
43052. battlefield galloped up.
43053. 
43054. "Now then, what do you want?" asked Napoleon in the tone of a man
43055. irritated at being continually disturbed.
43056. 
43057. "Sire, the prince..." began the adjutant.
43058. 
43059. "Asks for reinforcements?" said Napoleon with an angry gesture.
43060. 
43061. The adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but the
43062. Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came back, and
43063. called Berthier.
43064. 
43065. "We must give reserves," he said, moving his arms slightly apart.
43066. "Who do you think should be sent there?" he asked of Berthier (whom he
43067. subsequently termed "that gosling I have made an eagle").
43068. 
43069. "Send Claparede's division, sire," replied Berthier, who knew all the
43070. divisions regiments, and battalions by heart.
43071. 
43072. Napoleon nodded assent.
43073. 
43074. The adjutant galloped to Claparede's division and a few minutes later
43075. the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. Napoleon
43076. gazed silently in that direction.
43077. 
43078. "No!" he suddenly said to Berthier. "I can't send Claparede. Send
43079. Friant's division."
43080. 
43081. Though there was no advantage in sending Friant's division instead of
43082. Claparede's, and even in obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping
43083. Claparede and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly.
43084. Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the
43085. part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines--a role he so justly
43086. understood and condemned.
43087. 
43088. Friant's division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke
43089. of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a
43090. gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all asked
43091. for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding their
43092. positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the French army was
43093. melting away.
43094. 
43095. Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.
43096. 
43097. M. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning,
43098. came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His
43099. Majesty.
43100. 
43101. "I hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?" said he.
43102. 
43103. Napoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the negation to
43104. refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de Beausset ventured
43105. with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not
43106. having lunch when one can get it.
43107. 
43108. "Go away..." exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.
43109. 
43110. A beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M. de
43111. Beausset's face and he glided away to the other generals.
43112. 
43113. Napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an
43114. ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and always
43115. winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the
43116. game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he
43117. loses.
43118. 
43119. His troops were the same, his generals the same, the same preparations
43120. had been made, the same dispositions, and the same proclamation courte
43121. et energique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that
43122. he was now even more experienced and skillful than before. Even the
43123. enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and Friedland--yet the terrible
43124. stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent.
43125. 
43126. All the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success: the
43127. concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by reserves to break
43128. the enemy's line, and a cavalry attack by "the men of iron," all these
43129. methods had already been employed, yet not only was there no victory,
43130. but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded,
43131. of reinforcements needed, of the impossibility of driving back the
43132. Russians, and of disorganization among his own troops.
43133. 
43134. Formerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a
43135. few phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with
43136. congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the
43137. corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and
43138. stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather
43139. in the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena,
43140. Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was happening
43141. to his troops.
43142. 
43143. Despite news of the capture of the fleches, Napoleon saw that this was
43144. not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former
43145. battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about
43146. him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and
43147. they all shunned one another's eyes--only a de Beausset could fail to
43148. grasp the meaning of what was happening.
43149. 
43150. But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of
43151. a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all
43152. efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that
43153. the least accident might now--with the fight balanced on such a strained
43154. center--destroy him and his army.
43155. 
43156. When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in
43157. which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon,
43158. or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the
43159. concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the
43160. Russians still holding their ground--a terrible feeling like a nightmare
43161. took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy
43162. him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall on his left wing,
43163. might break through his center, he himself might be killed by a stray
43164. cannon ball. All this was possible. In former battles he had only
43165. considered the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky
43166. chances presented themselves, and he expected them all. Yes, it was like
43167. a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him,
43168. and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows
43169. should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and
43170. limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in
43171. his helplessness.
43172. 
43173. The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French
43174. army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a campstool
43175. below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. Berthier
43176. approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to
43177. ascertain the position of affairs.
43178. 
43179. "What? What do you say?" asked Napoleon. "Yes, tell them to bring me my
43180. horse."
43181. 
43182. He mounted and rode toward Semenovsk.
43183. 
43184. Amid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through
43185. which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly
43186. or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before
43187. seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area. The roar of
43188. guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave
43189. a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux
43190. vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at Semenovsk, and through the
43191. smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They
43192. were Russians.
43193. 
43194. The Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semenovsk village and its
43195. knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent
43196. forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous
43197. slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the
43198. Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie
43199. from which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what was going on
43200. before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to
43201. depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair, for the first
43202. time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.
43203. 
43204. One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to lead
43205. the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near Napoleon,
43206. exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general's senseless
43207. offer.
43208. 
43209. Napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.
43210. 
43211. "At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard
43212. destroyed!" he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevardino.
43213. 
43214. 
43215. 
43216. 
43217. 
43218. CHAPTER XXXV
43219. 
43220. 
43221. On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat
43222. Kutuzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no
43223. orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.
43224. 
43225. "Yes, yes, do that," he replied to various proposals. "Yes, yes: go,
43226. dear boy, and have a look," he would say to one or another of those
43227. about him; or, "No, don't, we'd better wait!" He listened to the reports
43228. that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded
43229. that of him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he
43230. were not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in
43231. something else--in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who
43232. were reporting. By long years of military experience he knew, and with
43233. the wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible for one man to
43234. direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death, and he
43235. knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a
43236. commander in chief, nor the place where the troops are stationed, nor by
43237. the number of cannon or of slaughtered men, but by that intangible force
43238. called the spirit of the army, and he watched this force and guided it
43239. in as far as that was in his power.
43240. 
43241. Kutuzov's general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention,
43242. and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master
43243. the fatigue of his old and feeble body.
43244. 
43245. At eleven o'clock they brought him news that the fleches captured by the
43246. French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagration was wounded. Kutuzov
43247. groaned and swayed his head.
43248. 
43249. "Ride over to Prince Peter Ivanovich and find out about it exactly," he
43250. said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of Wurttemberg
43251. who was standing behind him.
43252. 
43253. "Will Your Highness please take command of the first army?"
43254. 
43255. Soon after the duke's departure--before he could possibly have reached
43256. Semenovsk--his adjutant came back from him and told Kutuzov that the
43257. duke asked for more troops.
43258. 
43259. Kutuzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhturov to take over the
43260. command of the first army, and a request to the duke--whom he said he
43261. could not spare at such an important moment--to return to him. When
43262. they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the staff
43263. officers congratulated him, Kutuzov smiled.
43264. 
43265. "Wait a little, gentlemen," said he. "The battle is won, and there is
43266. nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to
43267. wait before we rejoice."
43268. 
43269. But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.
43270. 
43271. When Scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that the
43272. French had captured the fleches and the village of Semenovsk, Kutuzov,
43273. guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbinin's looks that the
43274. news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking Scherbinin's
43275. arm, led him aside.
43276. 
43277. "Go, my dear fellow," he said to Ermolov, "and see whether something
43278. can't be done."
43279. 
43280. Kutuzov was in Gorki, near the center of the Russian position. The
43281. attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several
43282. times repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond Borodino,
43283. and on their left flank Uvarov's cavalry had put the French to flight.
43284. 
43285. Toward three o'clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of all
43286. who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him,
43287. Kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was satisfied with
43288. the day's success--a success exceeding his expectations, but the old
43289. man's strength was failing him. Several times his head dropped low as if
43290. it were falling and he dozed off. Dinner was brought him.
43291. 
43292. Adjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince Andrew
43293. had said, "the war should be extended widely," and whom Bagration so
43294. detested, rode up while Kutuzov was at dinner. Wolzogen had come from
43295. Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank.
43296. The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men running
43297. back and the disordered rear of the army, weighed all the circumstances,
43298. concluded that the battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the
43299. commander in chief with that news.
43300. 
43301. Kutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced
43302. at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids.
43303. 
43304. Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kutuzov with a
43305. half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his
43306. cap.
43307. 
43308. He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance
43309. intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to
43310. Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom
43311. he was dealing with. "Der alte Herr" (as in their own set the Germans
43312. called Kutuzov) "is making himself very comfortable," thought Wolzogen,
43313. and looking severely at the dishes in front of Kutuzov he began to
43314. report to "the old gentleman" the position of affairs on the left flank
43315. as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood
43316. it.
43317. 
43318. "All the points of our position are in the enemy's hands and we cannot
43319. dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away and it is
43320. impossible to stop them," he reported.
43321. 
43322. Kutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as
43323. if not understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing "the old
43324. gentleman's" agitation, said with a smile:
43325. 
43326. "I have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness
43327. what I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder..."
43328. 
43329. "You have seen? You have seen?..." Kutuzov shouted frowning, and rising
43330. quickly he went up to Wolzogen.
43331. 
43332. "How... how dare you!..." he shouted, choking and making a threatening
43333. gesture with his trembling arms: "How dare you, sir, say that to me? You
43334. know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information
43335. is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to
43336. me, the commander in chief, than to him."
43337. 
43338. Wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kutuzov interrupted him.
43339. 
43340. "The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right
43341. flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what
43342. you don't know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform
43343. him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow," said Kutuzov
43344. sternly.
43345. 
43346. All were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of
43347. the panting old general.
43348. 
43349. "They are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army!
43350. The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred
43351. soil of Russia," said Kutuzov crossing himself, and he suddenly sobbed
43352. as his eyes filled with tears.
43353. 
43354. Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently
43355. aside, marveling at "the old gentleman's" conceited stupidity.
43356. 
43357. "Ah, here he is, my hero!" said Kutuzov to a portly, handsome,
43358. dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.
43359. 
43360. This was Raevski, who had spent the whole day at the most important part
43361. of the field of Borodino.
43362. 
43363. Raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and
43364. that the French no longer ventured to attack.
43365. 
43366. After hearing him, Kutuzov said in French:
43367. 
43368. "Then you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?"
43369. 
43370. "On the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is always
43371. the most stubborn who remain victors," replied Raevski, "and in my
43372. opinion..."
43373. 
43374. "Kaysarov!" Kutuzov called to his adjutant. "Sit down and write out
43375. the order of the day for tomorrow. And you," he continued, addressing
43376. another, "ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack."
43377. 
43378. While Kutuzov was talking to Raevski and dictating the order of the day,
43379. Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General Barclay wished to
43380. have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given.
43381. 
43382. Kutuzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to
43383. be written out which the former commander in chief, to avoid personal
43384. responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.
43385. 
43386. And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains
43387. throughout an army one and the same temper, known as "the spirit of
43388. the army," and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kutuzov's words, his
43389. order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of
43390. the army to the other.
43391. 
43392. It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the
43393. farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at
43394. different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kutuzov had said,
43395. but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was
43396. not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in
43397. the commander in chief's soul as in that of every Russian.
43398. 
43399. And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing
43400. from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe,
43401. the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.
43402. 
43403. 
43404. 
43405. 
43406. 
43407. CHAPTER XXXVI
43408. 
43409. 
43410. Prince Andrew's regiment was among the reserves which till after one
43411. o'clock were stationed inactive behind Semenovsk, under heavy artillery
43412. fire. Toward two o'clock the regiment, having already lost more than
43413. two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap
43414. between Semenovsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished
43415. that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred
43416. enemy guns was directed between one and two o'clock.
43417. 
43418. Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here
43419. lost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the
43420. right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious
43421. domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing
43422. cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as
43423. if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which
43424. the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men
43425. were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually
43426. being dragged away and the wounded carried off.
43427. 
43428. With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not
43429. yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred
43430. paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same
43431. mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the
43432. ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful
43433. shot and the cry of "stretchers!" was heard. Most of the time, by their
43434. officers' order, the men sat on the ground. One, having taken off his
43435. shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight
43436. again; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished
43437. his bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his
43438. bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put
43439. his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed
43440. ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed
43441. fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when
43442. rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great
43443. masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any
43444. attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or
43445. some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval
43446. were heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by
43447. occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was
43448. as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,
43449. commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of
43450. the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace.
43451. "Hey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She'll fall.... Ah,
43452. they don't see it!" came identical shouts from the ranks all along the
43453. regiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown
43454. dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner
43455. in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell
43456. close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted
43457. aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But
43458. such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had
43459. been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale
43460. and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.
43461. 
43462. Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up
43463. and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the
43464. meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back.
43465. There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything
43466. went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded
43467. carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the
43468. rear they returned immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew,
43469. considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them
43470. an example, walked about among the ranks, but he soon became convinced
43471. that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach
43472. them. All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were
43473. unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their
43474. situation. He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the
43475. grass, and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big
43476. strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the
43477. mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he must walk
43478. from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers
43479. from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his
43480. palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained
43481. of the previous day's thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with
43482. weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle
43483. of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the
43484. tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and
43485. waited. "Here it comes... this one is coming our way again!" he thought,
43486. listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. "One,
43487. another! Again! It has hit...." He stopped and looked at the ranks. "No,
43488. it has gone over. But this one has hit!" And again he started trying
43489. to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five
43490. paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A
43491. chill ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many
43492. had been hit--a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.
43493. 
43494. "Adjutant!" he shouted. "Order them not to crowd together."
43495. 
43496. The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew.
43497. From the other side a battalion commander rode up.
43498. 
43499. "Look out!" came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird
43500. whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped
43501. with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the
43502. battalion commander's horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it
43503. was right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the
43504. major, and galloped aside. The horse's terror infected the men.
43505. 
43506. "Lie down!" cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.
43507. 
43508. Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him
43509. and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and
43510. the meadow.
43511. 
43512. "Can this be death?" thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new,
43513. envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke
43514. that curled up from the rotating black ball. "I cannot, I do not wish
43515. to die. I love life--I love this grass, this earth, this air...." He
43516. thought this, and at the same time remembered that people were looking
43517. at him.
43518. 
43519. "It's shameful, sir!" he said to the adjutant. "What..."
43520. 
43521. He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of
43522. an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame,
43523. a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side,
43524. raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several officers ran up to him.
43525. From the right side of his abdomen, blood was welling out making a large
43526. stain on the grass.
43527. 
43528. The militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the
43529. officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass,
43530. breathing heavily and noisily.
43531. 
43532. "What are you waiting for? Come along!"
43533. 
43534. The peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but he
43535. moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.
43536. 
43537. "Pick him up, lift him, it's all the same!" cried someone.
43538. 
43539. They again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.
43540. 
43541. "Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My
43542. God!"--voices among the officers were heard saying.
43543. 
43544. "It flew a hair's breadth past my ear," said the adjutant.
43545. 
43546. The peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started
43547. hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing station.
43548. 
43549. "Keep in step! Ah... those peasants!" shouted an officer, seizing by
43550. their shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly and
43551. jolting the stretcher.
43552. 
43553. "Get into step, Fedor... I say, Fedor!" said the foremost peasant.
43554. 
43555. "Now that's right!" said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into
43556. step.
43557. 
43558. "Your excellency! Eh, Prince!" said the trembling voice of Timokhin, who
43559. had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.
43560. 
43561. Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the
43562. stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids
43563. drooped.
43564. 
43565. 
43566. The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the
43567. wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of
43568. three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood.
43569. In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating
43570. oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the
43571. grains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch
43572. trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than five acres,
43573. bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded
43574. stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive
43575. faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the
43576. spot. Disregarding the officers' orders, the soldiers stood leaning
43577. against their stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend
43578. the difficult problem of what was taking place before them. From the
43579. tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans. Occasionally
43580. dressers ran out to fetch water, or to point out those who were to be
43581. brought in next. The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents
43582. groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for vodka. Some were
43583. delirious. Prince Andrew's bearers, stepping over the wounded who had
43584. not yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental commander, close up to
43585. one of the tents and there stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew
43586. opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going
43587. on around him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the
43588. whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life.
43589. Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and
43590. attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired
43591. noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the
43592. head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a
43593. crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.
43594. 
43595. "We kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we grabbed
43596. the King himself!" cried he, looking around him with eyes that glittered
43597. with fever. "If only reserves had come up just then, lads, there
43598. wouldn't have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely..."
43599. 
43600. Like all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him with
43601. shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. "But isn't it all the
43602. same now?" thought he. "And what will be there, and what has there been
43603. here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in
43604. this life I did not and do not understand."
43605. 
43606. 
43607. 
43608. 
43609. 
43610. CHAPTER XXXVII
43611. 
43612. 
43613. One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron,
43614. holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small
43615. bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head and looked
43616. about him, but above the level of the wounded men. He evidently wanted a
43617. little respite. After turning his head from right to left for some time,
43618. he sighed and looked down.
43619. 
43620. "All right, immediately," he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince
43621. Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.
43622. 
43623. Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.
43624. 
43625. "It seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a
43626. chance!" remarked one.
43627. 
43628. Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been
43629. cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew could not
43630. make out distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all
43631. sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted
43632. him. All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked,
43633. bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as
43634. a few weeks previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled
43635. the dirty pond beside the Smolensk road. Yes, it was the same flesh,
43636. the same chair a canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with
43637. horror, as by a presentiment.
43638. 
43639. There were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, and
43640. on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he was left
43641. alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two
43642. tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by
43643. the uniform thrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and
43644. a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back.
43645. 
43646. "Ooh, ooh, ooh!" grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy
43647. snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth,
43648. he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing,
43649. and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many people were
43650. crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back.
43651. His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely
43652. familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest
43653. to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all
43654. the time with a feverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking
43655. convulsively. Two doctors--one of whom was pale and trembling--were
43656. silently doing something to this man's other, gory leg. When he had
43657. finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the
43658. spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.
43659. 
43660. He glanced at Prince Andrew's face and quickly turned away.
43661. 
43662. "Undress him! What are you waiting for?" he cried angrily to the
43663. dressers.
43664. 
43665. His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince
43666. Andrew's mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to
43667. undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent
43668. down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to
43669. someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to
43670. lose consciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of
43671. his thighbone had been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the
43672. wound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince
43673. Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the
43674. lips, and hurried away.
43675. 
43676. After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a
43677. blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All
43678. the best and happiest moments of his life--especially his earliest
43679. childhood, when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning
43680. over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the
43681. pillow, felt happy in the mere consciousness of life--returned to his
43682. memory, not merely as something past but as something present.
43683. 
43684. The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose
43685. head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and
43686. trying to quiet him.
43687. 
43688. "Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!" his frightened moans could
43689. be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.
43690. 
43691. Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep. Whether because he
43692. was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life,
43693. or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or
43694. because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him
43695. was groaning so piteously--he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and
43696. almost happy tears.
43697. 
43698. The wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood
43699. and with the boot still on.
43700. 
43701. "Oh! Oh, ooh!" he sobbed, like a woman.
43702. 
43703. The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew
43704. from seeing his face, moved away.
43705. 
43706. "My God! What is this? Why is he here?" said Prince Andrew to himself.
43707. 
43708. In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been
43709. amputated, he recognized Anatole Kuragin. Men were supporting him in
43710. their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen
43711. lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. "Yes, it is
43712. he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,"
43713. thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him.
43714. "What is the connection of that man with my childhood and life?" he
43715. asked himself without finding an answer. And suddenly a new unexpected
43716. memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to
43717. him. He remembered Natasha as he had seen her for the first time at the
43718. ball in 1810, with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy
43719. face ready for rapture, and love and tenderness for her, stronger
43720. and more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul. He now remembered the
43721. connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly
43722. gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered
43723. everything, and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy
43724. heart.
43725. 
43726. Prince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving
43727. tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and their errors.
43728. 
43729. "Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those
43730. who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on
43731. earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understand--that
43732. is what made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me
43733. had I lived. But now it is too late. I know it!"
43734. 
43735. 
43736. 
43737. 
43738. 
43739. CHAPTER XXXVIII
43740. 
43741. 
43742. The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded,
43743. together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty
43744. generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the
43745. consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an
43746. unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the
43747. killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of
43748. mind. This day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame
43749. that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his
43750. greatness. He rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the
43751. Shevardino knoll, where he sat on his campstool, his sallow face
43752. swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse,
43753. involuntarily listening, with downcast eyes, to the sounds of firing.
43754. With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he
43755. regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest.
43756. A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the
43757. artificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own
43758. person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield.
43759. The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility
43760. of suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not desire
43761. Moscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any more glory?). The
43762. one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he
43763. had been on the Semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed
43764. to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to
43765. strengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkovo.
43766. Napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought
43767. to him of the effect those batteries produced.
43768. 
43769. An adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns
43770. had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they
43771. still held their ground.
43772. 
43773. "Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on," said the
43774. adjutant.
43775. 
43776. "They want more!..." said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.
43777. 
43778. "Sire?" asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.
43779. 
43780. "They want more!" croaked Napoleon frowning. "Let them have it!"
43781. 
43782. Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for
43783. which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him,
43784. was being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary
43785. greatness, and again--as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing
43786. something for itself--he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy,
43787. and inhuman role predestined for him.
43788. 
43789. And not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience
43790. darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening
43791. lay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the end
43792. of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the
43793. significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and
43794. truth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to
43795. grasp their meaning. He could not disavow his actions, belauded as they
43796. were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and
43797. all humanity.
43798. 
43799. Not only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men
43800. killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as he
43801. looked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and,
43802. deceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that
43803. there were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone
43804. did he write in a letter to Paris that "the battle field was superb,"
43805. because fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the island of St.
43806. Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his
43807. leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done, he wrote:
43808. 
43809. 
43810. The Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times:
43811. it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and
43812. security of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.
43813. 
43814. It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the
43815. beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening out,
43816. full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system was
43817. already founded; all that remained was to organize it.
43818. 
43819. Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I
43820. too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were
43821. stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have
43822. discussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account to
43823. the peoples as clerk to master.
43824. 
43825. Europe would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people, and
43826. anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the
43827. common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all navigable
43828. rivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all, and that
43829. the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards
43830. for the sovereigns.
43831. 
43832. On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent,
43833. peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed
43834. her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, all
43835. aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated my son in the
43836. Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and his constitutional
43837. reign would have begun.
43838. 
43839. Paris would have been the capital of the world, and the French the envy
43840. of the nations!
43841. 
43842. My leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company
43843. with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to
43844. leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country couple,
43845. every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs,
43846. and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and
43847. everywhere.
43848. 
43849. 
43850. Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner
43851. of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the
43852. peoples' welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by
43853. the employment of power confer benefactions.
43854. 
43855. 
43856. "Of four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula," he wrote further
43857. of the Russian war, "half were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles,
43858. Bavarians, Wurttembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and
43859. Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third
43860. composed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine,
43861. Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the
43862. Thirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it
43863. included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French. The
43864. Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand men;
43865. the Russian army in its retreat from Vilna to Moscow lost in the various
43866. battles four times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow
43867. cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and want
43868. in the woods; finally, in its march from Moscow to the Oder the Russian
43869. army also suffered from the severity of the season; so that by the time
43870. it reached Vilna it numbered only fifty thousand, and at Kalisch less
43871. than eighteen thousand."
43872. 
43873. 
43874. He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the
43875. horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the
43876. whole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found
43877. justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who
43878. perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.
43879. 
43880. 
43881. 
43882. 
43883. 
43884. CHAPTER XXXIX
43885. 
43886. 
43887. Several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and
43888. various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the Davydov
43889. family and to the crown serfs--those fields and meadows where for
43890. hundreds of years the peasants of Borodino, Gorki, Shevardino, and
43891. Semenovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At the
43892. dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space
43893. of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms, wounded and
43894. unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves back to Mozhaysk
43895. from the one army and back to Valuevo from the other. Other crowds,
43896. exhausted and hungry, went forward led by their officers. Others held
43897. their ground and continued to fire.
43898. 
43899. Over the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of
43900. bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now spread a
43901. mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood.
43902. Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded,
43903. on the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: "Enough,
43904. men! Enough! Cease... bethink yourselves! What are you doing?"
43905. 
43906. To the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest,
43907. it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to
43908. slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the
43909. question arose in every soul: "For what, for whom, must I kill and be
43910. killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I don't want to do
43911. so anymore!" By evening this thought had ripened in every soul. At any
43912. moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were
43913. doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere.
43914. 
43915. But though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of
43916. what they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off,
43917. some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and
43918. they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match,
43919. though only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though
43920. they stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood
43921. and powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both
43922. sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done
43923. by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds
43924. continued.
43925. 
43926. Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have
43927. said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would
43928. disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have
43929. said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the
43930. French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor the Russians made
43931. that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out.
43932. 
43933. The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking
43934. the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the
43935. way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the
43936. beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French
43937. from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all
43938. the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian
43939. army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their
43940. positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army.
43941. 
43942. The French, with the memory of all their former victories during
43943. fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon's invincibility, with the
43944. consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had
43945. lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact,
43946. twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. The French
43947. who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position
43948. ought to have made that effort, for as long as the Russians continued to
43949. block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French had not been
43950. attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain. But the French
43951. did not make that effort. Some historians say that Napoleon need only
43952. have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have
43953. been won. To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his
43954. Guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. It
43955. could not be. Napoleon did not give his Guards, not because he did not
43956. want to, but because it could not be done. All the generals, officers,
43957. and soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done, because the
43958. flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it.
43959. 
43960. It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling
43961. of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and
43962. soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,
43963. after all their experience of previous battles--when after one tenth of
43964. such efforts the enemy had fled--experienced a similar feeling of terror
43965. before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly
43966. at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral force of the
43967. attacking French army was exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is
43968. defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called
43969. standards, and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were
43970. standing, but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral
43971. superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the
43972. Russians at Borodino. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal
43973. that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were
43974. perishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, weaker
43975. by one half, could help swerving. By impetus gained, the French army was
43976. still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort
43977. on the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal
43978. wound it had received at Borodino. The direct consequence of the battle
43979. of Borodino was Napoleon's senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat
43980. along the old Smolensk road, the destruction of the invading army of
43981. five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on
43982. which at Borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger
43983. spirit had been laid.

43995. CHAPTER I
43996. 
43997. 
43998. Absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind.
43999. Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he
44000. examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the
44001. same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary
44002. division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements. There is a
44003. well known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that
44004. Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite
44005. of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise. By
44006. the time Achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the
44007. tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead
44008. of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered
44009. another one hundredth, and so on forever. This problem seemed to
44010. the ancients insoluble. The absurd answer (that Achilles could never
44011. overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily
44012. divided into discontinuous elements, whereas the motion both of Achilles
44013. and of the tortoise was continuous.
44014. 
44015. By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a
44016. solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we have admitted
44017. the conception of the infinitely small, and the resulting geometrical
44018. progression with a common ratio of one tenth, and have found the sum of
44019. this progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.
44020. 
44021. A modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with
44022. the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex
44023. problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.
44024. 
44025. This modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing
44026. with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small,
44027. and so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity)
44028. and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot
44029. avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of
44030. examining continuous motion.
44031. 
44032. In seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens.
44033. The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary
44034. human wills, is continuous.
44035. 
44036. To understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of
44037. history. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all
44038. those human wills, man's mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected
44039. units. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected
44040. series of continuous events and examine it apart from others, though
44041. there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event always
44042. flows uninterruptedly from another.
44043. 
44044. The second method is to consider the actions of some one man--a king or
44045. a commander--as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas
44046. the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a
44047. single historic personage.
44048. 
44049. Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually
44050. takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But however small the
44051. units it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others,
44052. or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to say that the will of
44053. many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is
44054. in itself false.
44055. 
44056. It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions
44057. drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some larger or
44058. smaller unit as the subject of observation--as criticism has every
44059. right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be
44060. arbitrarily selected.
44061. 
44062. Only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the
44063. differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and
44064. attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum of
44065. these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.
44066. 
44067. The first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an
44068. extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave their customary
44069. pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other, plunder and
44070. slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair, and for some
44071. years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive
44072. movement which first increases and then slackens. What was the cause of
44073. this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the mind of man.
44074. 
44075. The historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and
44076. doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris, calling
44077. these sayings and doings "the Revolution"; then they give a detailed
44078. biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him;
44079. tell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that
44080. is why this movement took place and those are its laws.
44081. 
44082. But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation, but
44083. plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious, because in
44084. it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger. The sum of
44085. human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and only the sum of
44086. those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.
44087. 
44088. "But every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors;
44089. every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been
44090. great men," says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time
44091. conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the
44092. conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of
44093. a war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my
44094. watch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring
44095. church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock
44096. reach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is
44097. caused by the position of the hands of the watch.
44098. 
44099. Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see
44100. the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to conclude
44101. that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the
44102. movement of the engine.
44103. 
44104. The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks
44105. are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak
44106. is budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow
44107. when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the
44108. unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the
44109. force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I see only a
44110. coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of
44111. life, and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the
44112. hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the engine, and the
44113. oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing, the engine
44114. moving, or of the winds of spring. To that I must entirely change my
44115. point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the
44116. bells, and of the wind. History must do the same. And attempts in this
44117. direction have already been made.
44118. 
44119. To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of
44120. our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and
44121. study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are
44122. moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance
44123. in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is
44124. evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering
44125. the laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much
44126. mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has
44127. been devoted to describing the actions of various kings, commanders,
44128. and ministers and propounding the historians' own reflections concerning
44129. these actions.
44130. 
44131. 
44132. 
44133. 
44134. 
44135. CHAPTER II
44136. 
44137. 
44138. The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. The Russian
44139. army and people avoided a collision till Smolensk was reached, and again
44140. from Smolensk to Borodino. The French army pushed on to Moscow, its
44141. goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, just as the
44142. velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth. Behind
44143. it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead
44144. were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal. Every soldier in
44145. Napoleon's army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.
44146. 
44147. The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred
44148. of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and
44149. consolidated. At Borodino a collision took place. Neither army was
44150. broken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately after the
44151. collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another
44152. having a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability the ball
44153. of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some
44154. distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its force.
44155. 
44156. The Russians retreated eighty miles--to beyond Moscow--and the French
44157. reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks after that
44158. there was not a single battle. The French did not move. As a bleeding,
44159. mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained inert in Moscow
44160. for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back:
44161. they made a dash for the Kaluga road, and (after a victory--for at
44162. Malo-Yaroslavets the field of conflict again remained theirs) without
44163. undertaking a single serious battle, they fled still more rapidly back
44164. to Smolensk, beyond Smolensk, beyond the Berezina, beyond Vilna, and
44165. farther still.
44166. 
44167. On the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, Kutuzov and the whole
44168. Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodino was a victory.
44169. Kutuzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare for a
44170. fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone,
44171. but because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who had taken
44172. part in the battle knew it.
44173. 
44174. But all that evening and next day reports came in one after another
44175. of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle
44176. proved physically impossible.
44177. 
44178. It was impossible to give battle before information had been collected,
44179. the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition replenished, the
44180. slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to replace those who had been
44181. killed, and before the men had had food and sleep. And meanwhile, the
44182. very next morning after the battle, the French army advanced of itself
44183. upon the Russians, carried forward by the force of its own momentum now
44184. seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance
44185. from its aim. Kutuzov's wish was to attack next day, and the whole
44186. army desired to do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so is not
44187. sufficient, there must also be a possibility of doing it, and that
44188. possibility did not exist. It was impossible not to retreat a day's
44189. march, and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another
44190. and a third day's march, and at last, on the first of September when
44191. the army drew near Moscow--despite the strength of the feeling that had
44192. arisen in all ranks--the force of circumstances compelled it to retire
44193. beyond Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, day's march, and
44194. abandoned Moscow to the enemy.
44195. 
44196. For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are
44197. made by generals--as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may
44198. imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle--the
44199. questions present themselves: Why did Kutuzov during the retreat not do
44200. this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Fili?
44201. Why did he not retire at once by the Kaluga road, abandoning Moscow? and
44202. so on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know,
44203. the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any
44204. commander in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all
44205. resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in
44206. our studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of
44207. troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our
44208. plans from some given moment. A commander in chief is never dealing
44209. with the beginning of any event--the position from which we always
44210. contemplate it. The commander in chief is always in the midst of a
44211. series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the
44212. whole import of an event that is occurring. Moment by moment the event
44213. is imperceptibly shaping itself, and at every moment of this continuous,
44214. uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the
44215. midst of a most complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies,
44216. authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions and is
44217. continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him,
44218. which constantly conflict with one another.
44219. 
44220. Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutuzov should
44221. have moved his army to the Kaluga road long before reaching Fili, and
44222. that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander
44223. in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not
44224. one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based
44225. on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.
44226. 
44227. A commander in chief's business, it would seem, is simply to choose one
44228. of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not
44229. wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to
44230. cross to the Kaluga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from
44231. Miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire. An
44232. order must be given him at once, that instant. And the order to retreat
44233. carries us past the turn to the Kaluga road. And after the adjutant
44234. comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken,
44235. and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go, and a
44236. courier from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does
44237. not admit of the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander in
44238. chief's rival, the man who is undermining him (and there are always
44239. not merely one but several such), presents a new project diametrically
44240. opposed to that of turning to the Kaluga road, and the commander in
44241. chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and
44242. a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of
44243. rewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants of the district pray to
44244. be defended, and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and
44245. gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer
44246. previously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who has been
44247. on reconnaissance, all describe the position of the enemy's army
44248. differently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these
44249. inevitable conditions of a commander in chief's actions describe to
44250. us, for instance, the position of the army at Fili and assume that the
44251. commander in chief could, on the first of September, quite freely decide
44252. whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army
44253. less than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had
44254. that question been settled? At Drissa and at Smolensk and most
44255. palpably of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevardino and on
44256. the twenty-sixth at Borodino, and each day and hour and minute of the
44257. retreat from Borodino to Fili.
44258. 
44259. 
44260. 
44261. 
44262. 
44263. CHAPTER III
44264. 
44265. 
44266. When Ermolov, having been sent by Kutuzov to inspect the position, told
44267. the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before Moscow
44268. and that they must retreat, Kutuzov looked at him in silence.
44269. 
44270. "Give me your hand," said he and, turning it over so as to feel the
44271. pulse, added: "You are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you are
44272. saying!"
44273. 
44274. Kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond Moscow
44275. without a battle.
44276. 
44277. On the Poklonny Hill, four miles from the Dorogomilov gate of Moscow,
44278. Kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside.
44279. A great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count Rostopchin, who
44280. had come out from Moscow, joined them. This brilliant company separated
44281. into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages
44282. of the position, the state of the army, the plans suggested, the
44283. situation of Moscow, and military questions generally. Though they had
44284. not been summoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they
44285. all felt that this was really a council of war. The conversations all
44286. dealt with public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal
44287. news, it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general
44288. matters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all
44289. these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the
44290. height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking
44291. among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose
44292. bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might
44293. overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being said
44294. and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not himself
44295. take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After hearing
44296. what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned
44297. away with an air of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of
44298. anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been
44299. chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental
44300. capacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had
44301. been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days
44302. before. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was
44303. described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform.
44304. (This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian
44305. army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the
44306. possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.) Count Rostopchin
44307. was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city
44308. train bands under the walls of the capital, but that he still could not
44309. help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening, and
44310. that had he known it sooner things would have been different.... A
44311. fifth group, displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions,
44312. discussed the direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group
44313. was talking absolute nonsense. Kutuzov's expression grew more and more
44314. preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that
44315. to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
44316. those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless
44317. commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the
44318. battle would still not take place. It would not take place because the
44319. commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but
44320. in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its
44321. inevitable abandonment. How could the commanders lead their troops to
44322. a field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The lower-grade
44323. officers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the
44324. position impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced
44325. as they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position being
44326. defended and others still discussed it, the question was no longer
44327. important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue.
44328. This Kutuzov knew well.
44329. 
44330. Bennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian
44331. patriotism (Kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing) by
44332. insisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as daylight
44333. to Kutuzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on Kutuzov who had
44334. brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if
44335. it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not
44336. given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this
44337. intrigue did not now occupy the old man's mind. One terrible question
44338. absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. The
44339. question for him now was: "Have I really allowed Napoleon to reach
44340. Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been
44341. yesterday when I ordered Platov to retreat, or was it the evening
44342. before, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it
44343. earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow
44344. must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must
44345. be given." To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to
44346. resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power to
44347. which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince Prozorovski,
44348. under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced
44349. that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against
44350. the Emperor's wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen
44351. commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain
44352. command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all
44353. the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear,
44354. and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But
44355. something had to be decided, and these conversations around him which
44356. were assuming too free a character must be stopped.
44357. 
44358. He called the most important generals to him.
44359. 
44360. "My head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself," said he, rising
44361. from the bench, and he rode to Fili where his carriages were waiting.
44362. 
44363. 
44364. 
44365. 
44366. 
44367. CHAPTER IV
44368. 
44369. 
44370. The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the
44371. better and roomier part of Andrew Savostyanov's hut. The men, women, and
44372. children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across
44373. the passage. Only Malasha, Andrew's six-year-old granddaughter whom
44374. his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar
44375. while drinking his tea, remained on the top of the brick oven in the
44376. larger room. Malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the
44377. faces, uniforms, and decorations of the generals, who one after another
44378. came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner
44379. under the icons. "Granddad" himself, as Malasha in her own mind called
44380. Kutuzov, sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep
44381. in a folding armchair, and continually cleared his throat and pulled at
44382. the collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed
44383. to pinch his neck. Those who entered went up one by one to the field
44384. marshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant
44385. Kaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing
44386. Kutuzov, but the latter moved his hand angrily and Kaysarov understood
44387. that his Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen.
44388. 
44389. Round the peasant's deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils, and
44390. papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another
44391. bench and put it beside the table. Ermolov, Kaysarov, and Toll, who had
44392. just arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost place, immediately
44393. under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high forehead merging into
44394. his bald crown. He had a St. George's Cross round his neck and looked
44395. pale and ill. He had been feverish for two days and was now shivering
44396. and in pain. Beside him sat Uvarov, who with rapid gesticulations was
44397. giving him some information, speaking in low tones as they all did.
44398. Chubby little Dokhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows
44399. raised and arms folded on his stomach. On the other side sat Count
44400. Ostermann-Tolstoy, seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts. His broad
44401. head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand.
44402. Raevski, twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his
44403. habit, glanced now at Kutuzov and now at the door with a look of
44404. impatience. Konovnitsyn's firm, handsome, and kindly face was lit up by
44405. a tender, sly smile. His glance met Malasha's, and the expression of his
44406. eyes caused the little girl to smile.
44407. 
44408. They were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of inspecting
44409. the position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited for him from
44410. four till six o'clock and did not begin their deliberations all that
44411. time but talked in low tones of other matters.
44412. 
44413. Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutuzov leave his corner and
44414. draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been
44415. placed there to light up his face.
44416. 
44417. Bennigsen opened the council with the question: "Are we to abandon
44418. Russia's ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to
44419. defend it?" A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a frown
44420. on every face and only Kutuzov's angry grunts and occasional cough
44421. broke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. Malasha too looked at
44422. "Granddad." She was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he
44423. seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.
44424. 
44425. "Russia's ancient and sacred capital!" he suddenly said, repeating
44426. Bennigsen's words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the
44427. false note in them. "Allow me to tell you, your excellency, that that
44428. question has no meaning for a Russian." (He lurched his heavy body
44429. forward.) "Such a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question
44430. I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one.
44431. The question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow
44432. without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well
44433. as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion," and he
44434. sank back in his chair.
44435. 
44436. The discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost.
44437. Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at
44438. Fili was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love
44439. of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank
44440. during the night and attack the French right flank the following day.
44441. Opinions were divided, and arguments were advanced for and against that
44442. project. Ermolov, Dokhturov, and Raevski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether
44443. feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital
44444. or guided by other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not
44445. to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course
44446. of events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other
44447. generals, however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of
44448. Moscow, spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat.
44449. Malasha, who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her,
44450. understood the meaning of the council differently. It seemed to her that
44451. it was only a personal struggle between "Granddad" and "Long-coat" as
44452. she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to
44453. one another, and in her heart she sided with "Granddad." In the midst of
44454. the conversation she noticed "Granddad" give Bennigsen a quick, subtle
44455. glance, and then to her joys he saw that "Granddad" said something to
44456. "Long-coat" which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced
44457. angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kutuzov's calm
44458. and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen's
44459. proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to
44460. attack the French right wing.
44461. 
44462. "Gentlemen," said Kutuzov, "I cannot approve of the count's plan. Moving
44463. troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military
44464. history supports that view. For instance..." Kutuzov seemed to reflect,
44465. searching for an example, then with a clear, naive look at Bennigsen he
44466. added: "Oh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count
44467. well remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our
44468. troops were rearranged too near the enemy..."
44469. 
44470. There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all.
44471. 
44472. The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all
44473. felt that there was no more to be said.
44474. 
44475. During one of these pauses Kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to
44476. speak. They all looked at him.
44477. 
44478. "Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken
44479. crockery," said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. "Gentlemen,
44480. I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I," he
44481. paused, "by the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country,
44482. order a retreat."
44483. 
44484. After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and
44485. circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.
44486. 
44487. Some of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different from
44488. the way they had spoken during the council, communicated something to
44489. their commander in chief.
44490. 
44491. Malasha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully
44492. backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its
44493. projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted
44494. out of the room.
44495. 
44496. When he had dismissed the generals Kutuzov sat a long time with his
44497. elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible question:
44498. "When, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable? When was
44499. that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame for it?"
44500. 
44501. "I did not expect this," said he to his adjutant Schneider when the
44502. latter came in late that night. "I did not expect this! I did not think
44503. this would happen."
44504. 
44505. "You should take some rest, your Serene Highness," replied Schneider.
44506. 
44507. "But no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!" exclaimed
44508. Kutuzov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist. "They
44509. shall too, if only..."
44510. 
44511. 
44512. 
44513. 
44514. 
44515. CHAPTER V
44516. 
44517. 
44518. At that very time, in circumstances even more important than retreating
44519. without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow,
44520. Rostopchin, who is usually represented as being the instigator of that
44521. event, acted in an altogether different manner from Kutuzov.
44522. 
44523. After the battle of Borodino the abandonment and burning of Moscow was
44524. as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.
44525. 
44526. Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the
44527. feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.
44528. 
44529. The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns
44530. and villages on Russian soil beginning with Smolensk, without the
44531. participation of Count Rostopchin and his broadsheets. The people
44532. awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear
44533. anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to
44534. find what it should do at that most difficult moment. And as soon as the
44535. enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property,
44536. while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left.
44537. 
44538. The consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and
44539. is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this,
44540. and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian
44541. Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July
44542. and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who
44543. went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half
44544. their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses
44545. itself not by phrases or by giving one's children to save the fatherland
44546. and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically,
44547. and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results.
44548. 
44549. "It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running
44550. away from Moscow," they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopchin
44551. impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed
44552. to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing
44553. it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that
44554. Rostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had
44555. committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the
44556. rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had
44557. remained intact and that during Napoleon's occupation the inhabitants
44558. had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen
44559. whom the Russians, and especially the Russian ladies, then liked so
44560. much.
44561. 
44562. They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to
44563. whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It was
44564. out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst thing
44565. that could happen. They went away even before the battle of Borodino and
44566. still more rapidly after it, despite Rostopchin's calls to defend Moscow
44567. or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of
44568. the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were
44569. to destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense Rostopchin wrote in
44570. his broadsheets. They knew that it was for the army to fight, and that
44571. if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house
44572. serfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that
44573. they must go away, sorry as they were to abandon their property
44574. to destruction. They went away without thinking of the tremendous
44575. significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to
44576. destruction, for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when
44577. abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned. They went away each on his
44578. own account, and yet it was only in consequence of their going away
44579. that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the
44580. greatest glory of the Russian people. The lady who, afraid of being
44581. stopped by Count Rostopchin's orders, had already in June moved with her
44582. Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her Saratov estate, with
44583. a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparte's servant, was really,
44584. simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia. But
44585. Count Rostopchin, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the
44586. government offices removed; now distributed quite useless weapons to
44587. the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the icons, and now
44588. forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints; now
44589. seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six
44590. of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich; now
44591. hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his
44592. own house; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding
44593. them for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory of
44594. having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed;
44595. now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him, and now
44596. reproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French residents from
44597. Moscow, and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalme (the center of the whole
44598. French colony in Moscow) to remain, but ordered the venerable old
44599. postmaster Klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particular
44600. offense; now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French
44601. and now, to get rid of them, handed over to them a man to be killed
44602. and himself drove away by a back gate; now declared that he would
44603. not survive the fall of Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums
44604. concerning his share in the affair--this man did not understand the
44605. meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself
44606. that would astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic
44607. feat; and like a child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable
44608. event--the abandonment and burning of Moscow--and tried with his puny
44609. hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore
44610. him along with it.
44611. 
44612. 
44613. 
44614. 
44615. 
44616. CHAPTER VI
44617. 
44618. 
44619. Helene, having returned with the court from Vilna to Petersburg, found
44620. herself in a difficult position.
44621. 
44622. In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who
44623. occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In Vilna she had formed
44624. an intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she returned to Petersburg
44625. both the magnate and the prince were there, and both claimed their
44626. rights. Helene was faced by a new problem--how to preserve her intimacy
44627. with both without offending either.
44628. 
44629. What would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did
44630. not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bezukhova, who evidently
44631. deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had she attempted
44632. concealment, or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position
44633. by cunning, she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself
44634. guilty. But Helene, like a really great man who can do whatever
44635. he pleases, at once assumed her own position to be correct, as she
44636. sincerely believed it to be, and that everyone else was to blame.
44637. 
44638. The first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her, she
44639. lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said firmly: "That's
44640. just like a man--selfish and cruel! I expected nothing else. A woman
44641. sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her reward! What
44642. right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and
44643. friendships? He is a man who has been more than a father to me!" The
44644. prince was about to say something, but Helene interrupted him.
44645. 
44646. "Well, yes," said she, "it may be that he has other sentiments for me
44647. than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door
44648. on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude!
44649. Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I
44650. render account only to God and to my conscience," she concluded, laying
44651. her hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to
44652. heaven.
44653. 
44654. "But for heaven's sake listen to me!"
44655. 
44656. "Marry me, and I will be your slave!"
44657. 
44658. "But that's impossible."
44659. 
44660. "You won't deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you..." said Helene,
44661. beginning to cry.
44662. 
44663. The prince tried to comfort her, but Helene, as if quite distraught,
44664. said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,
44665. that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but
44666. she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had
44667. never been her husband's wife, and that she had been sacrificed.
44668. 
44669. "But the law, religion..." said the prince, already yielding.
44670. 
44671. "The law, religion... What have they been invented for if they can't
44672. arrange that?" said Helene.
44673. 
44674. The prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him,
44675. and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the Society of Jesus,
44676. with whom he was on intimate terms.
44677. 
44678. A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which Helene gave at
44679. her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur de Jobert,
44680. a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes,
44681. a Jesuit a robe courte * was presented to her, and in the garden by the
44682. light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a
44683. long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the
44684. consolations the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and
44685. the next. Helene was touched, and more than once tears rose to her eyes
44686. and to those of Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance,
44687. for which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with
44688. her future directeur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de
44689. Jobert came to see Helene when she was alone, and after that often came
44690. again.
44691. 
44692. 
44693.     * Lay member of the Society of Jesus.
44694. 
44695. 
44696. One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt
44697. down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, middle-aged
44698. Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself afterward
44699. described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her
44700. soul. It was explained to her that this was la grace.
44701. 
44702. After that a long-frocked abbe was brought to her. She confessed to
44703. him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box
44704. containing the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to
44705. partake of. A few days later Helene learned with pleasure that she had
44706. now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the
44707. Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document.
44708. 
44709. All that was done around her and to her at this time, all the attention
44710. devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant,
44711. refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now in (she wore
44712. only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave her pleasure,
44713. but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim. And
44714. as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets
44715. the better of cleverer ones, Helene--having realized that the main
44716. object of all these words and all this trouble was, after converting her
44717. to Catholicism, to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to
44718. which she received indications)-before parting with her money insisted
44719. that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband
44720. should be performed. In her view the aim of every religion was merely
44721. to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to
44722. human desires. And with this aim, in one of her talks with her Father
44723. Confessor, she insisted on an answer to the question, in how far was she
44724. bound by her marriage?
44725. 
44726. They were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room.
44727. The scent of flowers came in at the window. Helene was wearing a white
44728. dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbe, a well-fed
44729. man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and white
44730. hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to Helene and, with a
44731. subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty,
44732. occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the
44733. subject. Helene with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his
44734. plump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks and every moment expected the
44735. conversation to take a fresh turn. But the abbe, though he evidently
44736. enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was absorbed in his mastery of the
44737. matter.
44738. 
44739. The course of the Father Confessor's arguments ran as follows: "Ignorant
44740. of the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow of conjugal
44741. fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married state without
44742. faith in the religious significance of marriage, committed an act of
44743. sacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have
44744. had. Yet in spite of this your vow was binding. You swerved from it.
44745. What did you commit by so acting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial
44746. sin, for you acted without evil intention. If now you married again
44747. with the object of bearing children, your sin might be forgiven. But the
44748. question is again a twofold one: firstly..."
44749. 
44750. But suddenly Helene, who was getting bored, said with one of her
44751. bewitching smiles: "But I think that having espoused the true religion I
44752. cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me."
44753. 
44754. The director of her conscience was astounded at having the case
44755. presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus' egg. He was
44756. delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil's progress, but could
44757. not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.
44758. 
44759. "Let us understand one another, Countess," said he with a smile, and
44760. began refuting his spiritual daughter's arguments.
44761. 
44762. 
44763. 
44764. 
44765. 
44766. CHAPTER VII
44767. 
44768. 
44769. Helene understood that the question was very simple and easy from
44770. the ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making
44771. difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter
44772. would be regarded by the secular authorities.
44773. 
44774. So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society.
44775. She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she
44776. had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only
44777. way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her. The elderly
44778. magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage
44779. with a woman whose husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but
44780. Helene's imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as
44781. marrying a maiden had its effect on him too. Had Helene herself shown
44782. the least sign of hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would
44783. certainly have been lost; but not only did she show no signs of secrecy
44784. or shame, on the contrary, with good-natured naivete she told her
44785. intimate friends (and these were all Petersburg) that both the prince
44786. and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was
44787. afraid of grieving either.
44788. 
44789. A rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Helene wanted to
44790. be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have
44791. opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and
44792. interesting Helene was in doubt which of the two men she should marry.
44793. The question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was
44794. the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There
44795. were, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of
44796. such a question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament
44797. of marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent,
44798. while the majority were interested in Helene's good fortune and in the
44799. question which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was
44800. right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not
44801. discuss, for that question had evidently been settled by people "wiser
44802. than you or me," as they said, and to doubt the correctness of that
44803. decision would be to risk exposing one's stupidity and incapacity to
44804. live in society.
44805. 
44806. Only Marya Dmitrievna Akhrosimova, who had come to Petersburg that
44807. summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express
44808. an opinion contrary to the general one. Meeting Helene at a ball she
44809. stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said
44810. in her gruff voice: "So wives of living men have started marrying
44811. again! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been
44812. forestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all the
44813. brothels," and with these words Marya Dmitrievna, turning up her wide
44814. sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round,
44815. moved across the room.
44816. 
44817. Though people were afraid of Marya Dmitrievna she was regarded in
44818. Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only noticed,
44819. and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had used, supposing
44820. the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.
44821. 
44822. Prince Vasili, who of late very often forgot what he had said and
44823. repeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his
44824. daughter whenever he chanced to see her:
44825. 
44826. "Helene, I have a word to say to you," and he would lead her
44827. aside, drawing her hand downward. "I have heard of certain projects
44828. concerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your father's
44829. heart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my
44830. dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to say," and
44831. concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his
44832. daughter's and move away.
44833. 
44834. Bilibin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man,
44835. and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as
44836. Helene always has--men friends who can never change into lovers--once
44837. gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.
44838. 
44839. "Listen, Bilibin," said Helene (she always called friends of that sort
44840. by their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her white,
44841. beringed fingers. "Tell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do.
44842. Which of the two?"
44843. 
44844. Bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with a
44845. smile on his lips.
44846. 
44847. "You are not taking me unawares, you know," said he. "As a true friend,
44848. I have thought and thought again about your affair. You see, if you
44849. marry the prince"--he meant the younger man--and he crooked one finger,
44850. "you forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will
44851. displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of
44852. connection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last days
44853. happy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be making
44854. a mesalliance by marrying you," and Bilibin smoothed out his forehead.
44855. 
44856. "That's a true friend!" said Helene beaming, and again touching
44857. Bilibin's sleeve. "But I love them, you know, and don't want to distress
44858. either of them. I would give my life for the happiness of them both."
44859. 
44860. Bilibin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could
44861. help in that difficulty.
44862. 
44863. "Une maitresse-femme! * That's what is called putting things squarely.
44864. She would like to be married to all three at the same time," thought he.
44865. 
44866. 
44867.     * A masterly woman.
44868. 
44869. 
44870. "But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?" Bilibin asked,
44871. his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so
44872. naive a question. "Will he agree?"
44873. 
44874. "Oh, he loves me so!" said Helene, who for some reason imagined that
44875. Pierre too loved her. "He will do anything for me."
44876. 
44877. Bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.
44878. 
44879. "Even divorce you?" said he.
44880. 
44881. Helene laughed.
44882. 
44883. Among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed
44884. marriage was Helene's mother, Princess Kuragina. She was continually
44885. tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned
44886. a subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the
44887. idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce
44888. and remarriage during a husband's lifetime, and the priest told her that
44889. it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel
44890. which (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband
44891. is alive.
44892. 
44893. Armed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, she
44894. drove to her daughter's early one morning so as to find her alone.
44895. 
44896. Having listened to her mother's objections, Helene smiled blandly and
44897. ironically.
44898. 
44899. "But it says plainly: 'Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced...'"
44900. said the old princess.
44901. 
44902. "Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de betises. Vous ne comprenez rein. Dans ma
44903. position j'ai des devoirs," * said Helene changing from Russian, in
44904. which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear,
44905. into French which suited it better.
44906. 
44907. 
44908.      * "Oh, Mamma, don't talk nonsense! You don't understand
44909.      anything. In my position I have obligations."
44910. 
44911. 
44912. "But, my dear...."
44913. 
44914. "Oh, Mamma, how is it you don't understand that the Holy Father, who has
44915. the right to grant dispensations..."
44916. 
44917. Just then the lady companion who lived with Helene came in to announce
44918. that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.
44919. 
44920. "Non, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse contre
44921. lui, parce qu'il m'a manque parole." *
44922. 
44923. 
44924.      * "No, tell him I don't wish to see him, I am furious with
44925.      him for not keeping his word to me."
44926. 
44927. 
44928. "Comtesse, a tout peche misericorde," * said a fair-haired young man
44929. with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.
44930. 
44931. 
44932.     * "Countess, there is mercy for every sin."
44933. 
44934. 
44935. The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who had
44936. entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter and
44937. sidled out of the room.
44938. 
44939. "Yes, she is right," thought the old princess, all her convictions
44940. dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. "She is right, but how
44941. is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so
44942. simple," she thought as she got into her carriage.
44943. 
44944. 
44945. By the beginning of August Helene's affairs were clearly defined and
44946. she wrote a letter to her husband--who, as she imagined, loved her very
44947. much--informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her having
44948. embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all the
44949. formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to him by
44950. the bearer of the letter.
44951. 
44952. 
44953. And so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful
44954. keeping--Your friend Helene.
44955. 
44956. 
44957. This letter was brought to Pierre's house when he was on the field of
44958. Borodino.
44959. 
44960. 
44961. 
44962. 
44963. 
44964. CHAPTER VIII
44965. 
44966. 
44967. Toward the end of the battle of Borodino, Pierre, having run down
44968. from Raevski's battery a second time, made his way through a gully to
44969. Knyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and
44970. seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in
44971. the crowds of soldiers.
44972. 
44973. The one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly
44974. from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return
44975. to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own
44976. bed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he
44977. be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt. But such
44978. ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.
44979. 
44980. Though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he
44981. was going, still on all sides there was what there had been on the field
44982. of battle. There were still the same suffering, exhausted, and sometimes
44983. strangely indifferent faces, the same blood, the same soldiers'
44984. overcoats, the same sounds of firing which, though distant now, still
44985. aroused terror, and besides this there were the foul air and the dust.
44986. 
44987. Having gone a couple of miles along the Mozhaysk road, Pierre sat down
44988. by the roadside.
44989. 
44990. Dusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay leaning on
44991. his elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in
44992. the darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying
44993. toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered and sat up. He
44994. had no idea how long he had been there. In the middle of the night three
44995. soldiers, having brought some firewood, settled down near him and began
44996. lighting a fire.
44997. 
44998. The soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire to burn
44999. and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and
45000. put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with
45001. the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were
45002. eating and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.
45003. 
45004. "And who may you be?" one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently
45005. meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: "If you want to eat
45006. we'll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest
45007. man."
45008. 
45009. "I, I..." said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social
45010. position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and
45011. better understood by them. "By rights I am a militia officer, but my men
45012. are not here. I came to the battle and have lost them."
45013. 
45014. "There now!" said one of the soldiers.
45015. 
45016. Another shook his head.
45017. 
45018. "Would you like a little mash?" the first soldier asked, and handed
45019. Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.
45020. 
45021. Pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called
45022. the food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food
45023. he had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping himself
45024. to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was lit up by
45025. the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.
45026. 
45027. "Where have you to go to? Tell us!" said one of them.
45028. 
45029. "To Mozhaysk."
45030. 
45031. "You're a gentleman, aren't you?"
45032. 
45033. "Yes."
45034. 
45035. "And what's your name?"
45036. 
45037. "Peter Kirilych."
45038. 
45039. "Well then, Peter Kirilych, come along with us, we'll take you there."
45040. 
45041. In the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozhaysk.
45042. 
45043. By the time they got near Mozhaysk and began ascending the steep hill
45044. into the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on with the
45045. soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill
45046. and that he had already passed it. He would not soon have remembered
45047. this, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he not halfway up the
45048. hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to look for him in the
45049. town and was returning to the inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the
45050. darkness by his white hat.
45051. 
45052. "Your excellency!" he said. "Why, we were beginning to despair! How is
45053. it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?"
45054. 
45055. "Oh, yes!" said Pierre.
45056. 
45057. The soldiers stopped.
45058. 
45059. "So you've found your folk?" said one of them. "Well, good-by, Peter
45060. Kirilych--isn't it?"
45061. 
45062. "Good-by, Peter Kirilych!" Pierre heard the other voices repeat.
45063. 
45064. "Good-by!" he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.
45065. 
45066. "I ought to give them something!" he thought, and felt in his pocket.
45067. "No, better not!" said another, inner voice.
45068. 
45069. There was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied.
45070. Pierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all, lay
45071. down in his carriage.
45072. 
45073. 
45074. 
45075. 
45076. 
45077. CHAPTER IX
45078. 
45079. 
45080. Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself
45081. falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality,
45082. he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans
45083. and cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and
45084. dread of death seized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and
45085. lifted his head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only
45086. someone's orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud,
45087. and talked to the innkeeper. Above Pierre's head some pigeons, disturbed
45088. by the movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof
45089. of the penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful
45090. smell of stable yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see
45091. the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.
45092. 
45093. "Thank God, there is no more of that!" he thought, covering up his head
45094. again. "Oh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded
45095. to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time, to the
45096. end..." thought he.
45097. 
45098. They, in Pierre's mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the
45099. battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before
45100. the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out
45101. clearly and sharply from everyone else.
45102. 
45103. "To be a soldier, just a soldier!" thought Pierre as he fell asleep,
45104. "to enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what
45105. they are. But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my
45106. outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run
45107. away from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve
45108. as a soldier after the duel with Dolokhov." And the memory of the dinner
45109. at the English Club when he had challenged Dolokhov flashed through
45110. Pierre's mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at Torzhok. And now
45111. a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind.
45112. It was taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him
45113. sat at the end of the table. "Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor.
45114. But he died!" thought Pierre. "Yes, he died, and I did not know he was
45115. alive. How sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive
45116. again!" On one side of the table sat Anatole, Dolokhov, Nesvitski,
45117. Denisov, and others like them (in his dream the category to which these
45118. men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of
45119. those he termed they), and he heard those people, Anatole and Dolokhov,
45120. shouting and singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his
45121. benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words
45122. was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but
45123. pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor
45124. was saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite
45125. distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the
45126. possibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind,
45127. firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they were
45128. kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him. Wishing to
45129. speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his
45130. legs grew cold and bare.
45131. 
45132. He felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak
45133. had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre
45134. opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but
45135. now they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.
45136. 
45137. "It is dawn," thought Pierre. "But that's not what I want. I want to
45138. hear and understand my benefactor's words." Again he covered himself up
45139. with his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there.
45140. There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts that
45141. someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.
45142. 
45143. Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that
45144. someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that
45145. day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to think
45146. and express his thoughts like that when awake.
45147. 
45148. "To endure war is the most difficult subordination of man's freedom to
45149. the law of God," the voice had said. "Simplicity is submission to the
45150. will of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they are simple. They do
45151. not talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden.
45152. Man can be master of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not
45153. fear it possesses all. If there were no suffering, man would not know
45154. his limitations, would not know himself. The hardest thing (Pierre went
45155. on thinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to
45156. unite the meaning of all. To unite all?" he asked himself. "No, not
45157. to unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts
45158. together is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, must harness
45159. them!" he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these
45160. words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the
45161. question that tormented him.
45162. 
45163. "Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness."
45164. 
45165. "Time to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your excellency!"
45166. some voice was repeating. "We must harness, it is time to harness...."
45167. 
45168. It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone
45169. straight into Pierre's face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the
45170. middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump
45171. while carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with
45172. repugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat.
45173. "No, I don't want that, I don't want to see and understand that. I want
45174. to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream. One second
45175. more and I should have understood it all! But what am I to do? Harness,
45176. but how can I harness everything?" and Pierre felt with horror that the
45177. meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed.
45178. 
45179. The groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an officer
45180. had come with news that the French were already near Mozhaysk and that
45181. our men were leaving it.
45182. 
45183. Pierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him, went on
45184. foot through the town.
45185. 
45186. The troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind
45187. them. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses, and
45188. the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that
45189. were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and blows could
45190. be heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken
45191. him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the
45192. way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of
45193. that of Prince Andrew.
45194. 
45195. 
45196. 
45197. 
45198. 
45199. CHAPTER X
45200. 
45201. 
45202. On the thirteenth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of
45203. the city he was met by Count Rostopchin's adjutant.
45204. 
45205. "We have been looking for you everywhere," said the adjutant. "The count
45206. wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on a
45207. very important matter."
45208. 
45209. Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow
45210. commander in chief.
45211. 
45212. Count Rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his summer
45213. villa at Sokolniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house
45214. were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders.
45215. Vasilchikov and Platov had already seen the count and explained to him
45216. that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be
45217. surrendered. Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants,
45218. the officials--the heads of the various government departments--knew
45219. that Moscow would soon be in the enemy's hands, just as Count Rostopchin
45220. himself knew it, and to escape personal responsibility they had all
45221. come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various
45222. departments.
45223. 
45224. As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came
45225. out of Rostopchin's private room.
45226. 
45227. In answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a
45228. despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.
45229. 
45230. While waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the
45231. various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who were there.
45232. They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of
45233. men, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they continued their
45234. conversation.
45235. 
45236. "If they're sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm,
45237. but as things are now one can't answer for anything."
45238. 
45239. "But you see what he writes..." said another, pointing to a printed
45240. sheet he held in his hand.
45241. 
45242. "That's another matter. That's necessary for the people," said the
45243. first.
45244. 
45245. "What is it?" asked Pierre.
45246. 
45247. "Oh, it's a fresh broadsheet."
45248. 
45249. Pierre took it and began reading.
45250. 
45251. 
45252. His Serene Highness has passed through Mozhaysk in order to join up with
45253. the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where
45254. the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty eight guns with ammunition
45255. have been sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he will
45256. defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in
45257. the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed;
45258. things have to be put in order, and we will deal with villains in our
45259. own way! When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and
45260. will raise the cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet
45261. so I hold my peace. An ax will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a
45262. three-pronged fork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a
45263. sheaf of rye. Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of
45264. the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will
45265. have some water blessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I,
45266. too, am well now: one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout
45267. with both.
45268. 
45269. 
45270. "But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the
45271. town," said Pierre, "and that the position..."
45272. 
45273. "Well, of course! That's what we were saying," replied the first
45274. speaker.
45275. 
45276. "And what does he mean by 'One of my eyes was sore but now I am on the
45277. lookout with both'?" asked Pierre.
45278. 
45279. "The count had a sty," replied the adjutant smiling, "and was very much
45280. upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with
45281. him. By the by, Count," he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a
45282. smile, "we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess,
45283. your wife..."
45284. 
45285. "I have heard nothing," Pierre replied unconcernedly. "But what have you
45286. heard?"
45287. 
45288. "Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I
45289. heard."
45290. 
45291. "But what did you hear?"
45292. 
45293. "Well, they say," continued the adjutant with the same smile, "that
45294. the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect it's
45295. nonsense...."
45296. 
45297. "Possibly," remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. "And who
45298. is that?" he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant
45299. overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face.
45300. 
45301. "He? That's a tradesman, that is to say, he's the restaurant
45302. keeper, Vereshchagin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the
45303. proclamation."
45304. 
45305. "Oh, so that is Vereshchagin!" said Pierre, looking at the firm, calm
45306. face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor.
45307. 
45308. "That's not he himself, that's the father of the fellow who wrote the
45309. proclamation," said the adjutant. "The young man is in prison and I
45310. expect it will go hard with him."
45311. 
45312. An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing a
45313. cross round his neck, approached the speaker.
45314. 
45315. "It's a complicated story, you know," said the adjutant. "That
45316. proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of
45317. it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivanovich
45318. here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly
45319. sixty-three hands. He asked one, 'From whom did you get it?' 'From
45320. so-and-so.' He went to the next one. 'From whom did you get it?' and so
45321. on till he reached Vereshchagin, a half educated tradesman, you know, 'a
45322. pet of a trader,'" said the adjutant smiling. "They asked him, 'Who gave
45323. it you?' And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could
45324. only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to
45325. some understanding. He replied: 'From no one; I made it up myself.'
45326. They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: 'I made it
45327. up myself.' And so it was reported to the count, who sent for the man.
45328. 'From whom did you get the proclamation?' 'I wrote it myself.' Well, you
45329. know the count," said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride,
45330. "he flared up dreadfully--and just think of the fellow's audacity,
45331. lying, and obstinacy!"
45332. 
45333.  "And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharev? I
45334. understand!" said Pierre.
45335. 
45336. "Not at all," rejoined the adjutant in dismay. "Klyucharev had his own
45337. sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished.
45338. But the point is that the count was much annoyed. 'How could you have
45339. written it yourself?' said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that
45340. was lying on the table. 'Here it is! You did not write it yourself but
45341. translated it, and translated it abominably, because you don't even know
45342. French, you fool.' And what do you think? 'No,' said he, 'I have not
45343. read any papers, I made it up myself.' 'If that's so, you're a traitor
45344. and I'll have you tried, and you'll be hanged! Say from whom you had
45345. it.' 'I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.' And that was the end
45346. of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it.
45347. He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the
45348. father has come to intercede for him. But he's a good-for-nothing lad!
45349. You know that sort of tradesman's son, a dandy and lady-killer. He
45350. attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match
45351. for him. That's the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop
45352. here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God
45353. Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other.
45354. Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?
45355. He found some scoundrel of a painter..."
45356. 
45357. 
45358. 
45359. 
45360. 
45361. CHAPTER XI
45362. 
45363. 
45364. In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander in
45365. chief.
45366. 
45367. When he entered the private room Count Rostopchin, puckering his face,
45368. was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying
45369. something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.
45370. 
45371. "Ah, how do you do, great warrior?" said Rostopchin as soon as the short
45372. man had left the room. "We have heard of your prowess. But that's not
45373. the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?" he
45374. went on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which
45375. he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. "I am well
45376. informed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope
45377. that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to
45378. ruin Russia."
45379. 
45380. "Yes, I am a Mason," Pierre replied.
45381. 
45382. "There, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. Speranski and
45383. Magnitski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. Klyucharev has
45384. been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of
45385. building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of
45386. their fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and
45387. that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful
45388. person. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage
45389. for his removal from town, and that you have even accepted papers from
45390. him for safe custody. I like you and don't wish you any harm and--as
45391. you are only half my age--I advise you, as a father would, to cease
45392. all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as
45393. possible."
45394. 
45395. "But what did Klyucharev do wrong, Count?" asked Pierre.
45396. 
45397. "That is for me to know, but not for you to ask," shouted Rostopchin.
45398. 
45399. "If he is accused of circulating Napoleon's proclamation it is not
45400. proved that he did so," said Pierre without looking at Rostopchin, "and
45401. Vereshchagin..."
45402. 
45403. "There we are!" Rostopchin shouted at Pierre louder than before,
45404. frowning suddenly. "Vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who will
45405. be punished as he deserves," said he with the vindictive heat with which
45406. people speak when recalling an insult. "But I did not summon you to
45407. discuss my actions, but to give you advice--or an order if you prefer
45408. it. I beg you to leave the town and break off all communication
45409. with such men as Klyucharev. And I will knock the nonsense out of
45410. anybody"--but probably realizing that he was shouting at Bezukhov who
45411. so far was not guilty of anything, he added, taking Pierre's hand in a
45412. friendly manner, "We are on the eve of a public disaster and I haven't
45413. time to be polite to everybody who has business with me. My head is
45414. sometimes in a whirl. Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?"
45415. 
45416. "Why, nothing," answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing the
45417. thoughtful expression of his face.
45418. 
45419. The count frowned.
45420. 
45421. "A word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can, that's
45422. all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my dear
45423. fellow. Oh, by the by!" he shouted through the doorway after Pierre,
45424. "is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy
45425. fathers of the Society of Jesus?"
45426. 
45427. Pierre did not answer and left Rostopchin's room more sullen and angry
45428. than he had ever before shown himself.
45429. 
45430. When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had
45431. come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel
45432. of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners.
45433. They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre
45434. did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and
45435. only answered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone
45436. at last he opened and read his wife's letter.
45437. 
45438. "They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old
45439. man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the
45440. meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting married... One
45441. must forget and understand..." And going to his bed he threw himself on
45442. it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.
45443. 
45444. When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a
45445. special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count Rostopchin to
45446. know whether Count Bezukhov had left or was leaving the town.
45447. 
45448. A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the
45449. drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see
45450. them, went to the back porch and out through the gate.
45451. 
45452. From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of
45453. Bezukhov's household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again
45454. or knew where he was.
45455. 
45456. 
45457. 
45458. 
45459. 
45460. CHAPTER XII
45461. 
45462. 
45463. The Rostovs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is,
45464. till the eve of the enemy's entry into the city.
45465. 
45466. After Petya had joined Obolenski's regiment of Cossacks and left for
45467. Belaya Tserkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized
45468. with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both
45469. gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them
45470. might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck
45471. her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to
45472. get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join Petya, or to get
45473. him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved
45474. possible. Petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless
45475. he was transferred to another regiment on active service. Nicholas was
45476. somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter,
45477. in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with Princess
45478. Mary. The countess did not sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep
45479. dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead. After many consultations and
45480. conversations, the count at last devised means to tranquillize her. He
45481. got Petya transferred from Obolenski's regiment to Bezukhov's, which was
45482. in training near Moscow. Though Petya would remain in the service, this
45483. transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one
45484. of her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her
45485. Petya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed to
45486. places where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As long as
45487. Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her
45488. first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself
45489. for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at
45490. lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a
45491. nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed Petya with his merry black eyes
45492. and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show--when
45493. he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting
45494. somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it--then
45495. his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other
45496. children. The nearer the time came for Petya to return, the more uneasy
45497. grew the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such
45498. happiness. The presence of Sonya, of her beloved Natasha, or even of
45499. her husband irritated her. "What do I want with them? I want no one but
45500. Petya," she thought.
45501. 
45502. At the end of August the Rostovs received another letter from Nicholas.
45503. He wrote from the province of Voronezh where he had been sent to procure
45504. remounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that
45505. one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about Petya.
45506. 
45507. Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostovs' acquaintances
45508. had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to
45509. get away as quickly as possible, she would not hear of leaving before
45510. her treasure, her adored Petya, returned. On the twenty-eighth of August
45511. he arrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him
45512. did not please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from
45513. him her intention of keeping him under her wing, Petya guessed her
45514. designs, and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion
45515. when with her--might "become womanish" as he termed it to himself--he
45516. treated her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached
45517. himself exclusively to Natasha for whom he had always had a particularly
45518. brotherly tenderness, almost lover-like.
45519. 
45520. Owing to the count's customary carelessness nothing was ready for their
45521. departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to
45522. come from their Ryazan and Moscow estates to remove their household
45523. belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.
45524. 
45525. From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle
45526. and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodino were
45527. brought in by the Dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow,
45528. and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions
45529. out by the other gates. In spite of Rostopchin's broadsheets, or because
45530. of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory
45531. rumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed
45532. to leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had
45533. been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave.
45534. Some said there had been another battle after Borodino at which the
45535. French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the
45536. Russian army had been destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia
45537. which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others
45538. whispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had
45539. been seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their
45540. way from Moscow, and so on. But all this was only talk; in reality
45541. (though the Council of Fili, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow,
45542. had not yet been held) both those who went away and those who remained
45543. behind felt, though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly
45544. be abandoned, and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and
45545. save their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break
45546. up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so.
45547. As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die
45548. immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is
45549. awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life,
45550. though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the
45551. conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would
45552. be completely upset.
45553. 
45554. During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole
45555. Rostov family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the
45556. family, Count Ilya Rostov, continually drove about the city collecting
45557. the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders
45558. at home about the preparations for their departure.
45559. 
45560. The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with
45561. everything, was constantly in pursuit of Petya who was always running
45562. away from her, and was jealous of Natasha with whom he spent all his
45563. time. Sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting
45564. things packed. But of late Sonya had been particularly sad and silent.
45565. Nicholas' letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in
45566. her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention
45567. of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas.
45568. 
45569. "I was never pleased at Bolkonski's engagement to Natasha," said the
45570. countess, "but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a
45571. presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!"
45572. 
45573. Sonya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving
45574. the Rostovs' affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the
45575. princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite
45576. her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the
45577. difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and
45578. was busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they
45579. had any orders to give. Petya and Natasha on the contrary, far from
45580. helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to
45581. everyone. Almost all day long the house resounded with their running
45582. feet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were
45583. gay not because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and
45584. mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause
45585. for gaiety and laughter to them. Petya was in high spirits because
45586. having left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine
45587. young man, because he was at home, because he had left Belaya Tserkov
45588. where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to
45589. Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because
45590. Natasha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Natasha was
45591. gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of
45592. the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also
45593. happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others
45594. was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run
45595. freely--and Petya adored her. Above all, they were gay because there was
45596. a war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the town gates, arms were
45597. being given out, everybody was escaping--going away somewhere, and
45598. in general something extraordinary was happening, and that is always
45599. exciting, especially to the young.
45600.

45604. 
45605. CHAPTER XIII
45606. 
45607. 
45608. On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the Rostovs'
45609. house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was
45610. being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been
45611. taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and
45612. ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out
45613. the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was
45614. crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up,
45615. others still empty.
45616. 
45617. The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who
45618. had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in
45619. the yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The
45620. countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was
45621. lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head.
45622. Petya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant
45623. to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army. Sonya was in
45624. the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china. Natasha
45625. was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons,
45626. and scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and
45627. holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which
45628. she had worn at her first Petersburg ball.
45629. 
45630. Natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and
45631. several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was
45632. not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except
45633. with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood beside
45634. Sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave
45635. it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it
45636. amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was
45637. done and what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.
45638. 
45639. "Dunyasha, you pack! You will, won't you, dear?" And when Dunyasha
45640. willingly promised to do it all for her, Natasha sat down on the floor,
45641. took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what
45642. ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie
45643. by the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the
45644. sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch. Natasha got
45645. up and looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of
45646. wounded men had stopped in the street.
45647. 
45648. The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,
45649. postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.
45650. 
45651. Natasha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding
45652. an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.
45653. 
45654. The former housekeeper, old Mavra Kuzminichna, had stepped out of the
45655. crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast
45656. mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside.
45657. Natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her
45658. handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.
45659. 
45660. "Then you have nobody in Moscow?" she was saying. "You would be more
45661. comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family
45662. are leaving."
45663. 
45664. "I don't know if it would be allowed," replied the officer in a weak
45665. voice. "Here is our commanding officer... ask him," and he pointed to a
45666. stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.
45667. 
45668. Natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer
45669. and at once went to meet the major.
45670. 
45671. "May the wounded men stay in our house?" she asked.
45672. 
45673. The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.
45674. 
45675. "Which one do you want, Ma'am'selle?" said he, screwing up his eyes and
45676. smiling.
45677. 
45678. Natasha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole
45679. manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of
45680. her handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some
45681. reflection--as if considering in how far the thing was possible--replied
45682. in the affirmative.
45683. 
45684. "Oh yes, why not? They may," he said.
45685. 
45686. With a slight inclination of her head, Natasha stepped back quickly to
45687. Mavra Kuzminichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer.
45688. 
45689. "They may. He says they may!" whispered Natasha.
45690. 
45691. The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostovs' yard,
45692. and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the
45693. townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the
45694. houses in Povarskaya Street. Natasha was evidently pleased to be dealing
45695. with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and Mavra
45696. Kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their
45697. yard.
45698. 
45699. "Your Papa must be told, though," said Mavra Kuzminichna.
45700. 
45701. "Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move
45702. into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house."
45703. 
45704. "There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we
45705. put them into the wing, the men's room, or the nurse's room, we must ask
45706. permission."
45707. 
45708. "Well, I'll ask."
45709. 
45710. Natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door
45711. into the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffman's
45712. drops.
45713. 
45714. "Are you asleep, Mamma?"
45715. 
45716. "Oh, what sleep-?" said the countess, waking up just as she was dropping
45717. into a doze.
45718. 
45719. "Mamma darling!" said Natasha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her
45720. face close to her mother's, "I am sorry, forgive me, I'll never do it
45721. again; I woke you up! Mavra Kuzminichna has sent me: they have brought
45722. some wounded here--officers. Will you let them come? They have nowhere
45723. to go. I knew you'd let them come!" she said quickly all in one breath.
45724. 
45725. "What officers? Whom have they brought? I don't understand anything
45726. about it," said the countess.
45727. 
45728. Natasha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.
45729. 
45730. "I knew you'd give permission... so I'll tell them," and, having kissed
45731. her mother, Natasha got up and went to the door.
45732. 
45733. In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.
45734. 
45735. "We've stayed too long!" said the count with involuntary vexation. "The
45736. Club is closed and the police are leaving."
45737. 
45738. "Papa, is it all right--I've invited some of the wounded into the
45739. house?" said Natasha.
45740. 
45741. "Of course it is," he answered absently. "That's not the point. I beg
45742. you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we
45743. must go, go, go!...."
45744. 
45745. And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.
45746. 
45747. At dinner Petya having returned home told them the news he had heard.
45748. He said the people had been getting arms in the Kremlin, and that though
45749. Rostopchin's broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three
45750. days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone
45751. to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big
45752. battle there.
45753. 
45754. The countess looked with timid horror at her son's eager, excited face
45755. as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not
45756. going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending
45757. engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the
45758. fatherland--something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there
45759. would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and so,
45760. hoping to arrange to leave before then and take Petya with her as their
45761. protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after dinner called
45762. the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly,
45763. that very night if possible. With a woman's involuntary loving cunning
45764. she, who till then had not shown any alarm, said that she would die of
45765. fright if they did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she
45766. was now afraid of everything.
45767. 
45768. 
45769. 
45770. 
45771. 
45772. CHAPTER XIV
45773. 
45774. 
45775. Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the
45776. countess' fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit
45777. dealer's in Myasnitski Street. When returning by that street she had
45778. been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of
45779. the shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the
45780. cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at
45781. the drink store, having received orders to do so.
45782. 
45783. After dinner the whole Rostov household set to work with enthusiastic
45784. haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The
45785. old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the
45786. house and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying
45787. people, and flurrying them still more. Petya directed things in the
45788. yard. Sonya, owing to the count's contradictory orders, lost her head
45789. and did not know what to do. The servants ran noisily about the house
45790. and yard, shouting and disputing. Natasha, with the ardor characteristic
45791. of all she did suddenly set to work too. At first her intervention in
45792. the business of packing was received skeptically. Everybody expected
45793. some prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely
45794. and passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because
45795. they did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her.
45796. Her first exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her
45797. authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable
45798. Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natasha set
45799. to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost full
45800. up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much china
45801. standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from the
45802. storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it.
45803. 
45804. "Sonya, wait a bit--we'll pack everything into these," said Natasha.
45805. 
45806. "You can't, Miss, we have tried to," said the butler's assistant.
45807. 
45808. "No, wait a minute, please."
45809. 
45810. And Natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates
45811. wrapped in paper.
45812. 
45813. "The dishes must go in here among the carpets," said she.
45814. 
45815. "Why, it's a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases,"
45816. said the butler's assistant.
45817. 
45818. "Oh, wait, please!" And Natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the
45819. things. "These aren't needed," said she, putting aside some plates of
45820. Kiev ware. "These--yes, these must go among the carpets," she said,
45821. referring to the Saxony china dishes.
45822. 
45823. "Don't, Natasha! Leave it alone! We'll get it all packed," urged Sonya
45824. reproachfully.
45825. 
45826. "What a young lady she is!" remarked the major-domo.
45827. 
45828. But Natasha would not give in. She turned everything out and began
45829. quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and
45830. unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had
45831. been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned
45832. out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been
45833. rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only
45834. the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A few
45835. more things might have been taken out, but Natasha insisted on having
45836. her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler's assistant
45837. and Petya--whom she had drawn into the business of packing--press on the
45838. lid, and made desperate efforts herself.
45839. 
45840. "That's enough, Natasha," said Sonya. "I see you were right, but just
45841. take out the top one."
45842. 
45843. "I won't!" cried Natasha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung
45844. over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the
45845. carpets. "Now press, Petya! Press, Vasilich, press hard!" she cried.
45846. 
45847. The carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natasha, clapping her hands,
45848. screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only
45849. lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her
45850. completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that Natasha
45851. had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her
45852. to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might
45853. be corded up. Thanks to Natasha's directions the work now went on
45854. expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable
45855. packed as compactly as possible.
45856. 
45857. But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not
45858. get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count,
45859. having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.
45860. 
45861. Sonya and Natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing.
45862. 
45863. That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskaya, and Mavra
45864. Kuzminichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the
45865. Rostovs' yard. Mavra Kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important
45866. man. He was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood, and was
45867. quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable
45868. old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a
45869. cart.
45870. 
45871. "Please come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house
45872. will be empty," said the old woman to the old attendant.
45873. 
45874. "Well, perhaps," said he with a sigh. "We don't expect to get him home
45875. alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it's a long way from
45876. here, and there's nobody living in it."
45877. 
45878. "Do us the honor to come in, there's plenty of everything in the
45879. master's house. Come in," said Mavra Kuzminichna. "Is he very ill?" she
45880. asked.
45881. 
45882. The attendant made a hopeless gesture.
45883. 
45884. "We don't expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor."
45885. 
45886. And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.
45887. 
45888. "All right!" said the doctor.
45889. 
45890. The old servant returned to the caleche, looked into it, shook his
45891. head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped
45892. beside Mavra Kuzminichna.
45893. 
45894. "O, Lord Jesus Christ!" she murmured.
45895. 
45896. She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.
45897. 
45898. "The masters won't object..." she said.
45899. 
45900. But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him
45901. into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schoss'.
45902. 
45903. This wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkonski.
45904. 
45905. 
45906. 
45907. 
45908. 
45909. CHAPTER XV
45910. 
45911. 
45912. Moscow's last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday.
45913. The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on
45914. Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.
45915. 
45916. Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscow--the rabble,
45917. that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd
45918. of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials,
45919. seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to
45920. the Three Hills. Having waited there for Rostopchin who did not turn
45921. up, they became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then
45922. dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices
45923. too that day indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of
45924. gold, of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and
45925. city articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of
45926. carters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment
45927. a half of what they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five
45928. hundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being
45929. given away for nothing.
45930. 
45931. In the Rostovs' staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former
45932. conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only
45933. indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared
45934. during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their
45935. possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their
45936. estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and
45937. they were offered enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge
45938. sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and
45939. early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants
45940. sent by wounded officers came to the Rostovs' and wounded men dragged
45941. themselves there from the Rostovs' and from neighboring houses where
45942. they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them
45943. a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were
45944. addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused,
45945. saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these
45946. wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one
45947. cart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and
45948. one's own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save all the wounded
45949. and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one's
45950. own family. So thought the major-domo on his master's behalf.
45951. 
45952. On waking up that morning Count Ilya Rostov left his bedroom softly, so
45953. as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning,
45954. and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard
45955. stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch.
45956. The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to
45957. a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the
45958. major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away.
45959. 
45960. "Well, Vasilich, is everything ready?" asked the count, and stroking his
45961. bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and
45962. nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)
45963. 
45964. "We can harness at once, your excellency."
45965. 
45966. "Well, that's right. As soon as the countess wakes we'll be off, God
45967. willing! What is it, gentlemen?" he added, turning to the officer. "Are
45968. you staying in my house?"
45969. 
45970. The officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.
45971. 
45972. "Count, be so good as to allow me... for God's sake, to get into some
45973. corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be
45974. all right on a loaded cart..."
45975. 
45976. Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same
45977. request on behalf of his master.
45978. 
45979. "Oh, yes, yes, yes!" said the count hastily. "I shall be very pleased,
45980. very pleased. Vasilich, you'll see to it. Just unload one or two carts.
45981. Well, what of it... do what's necessary..." said the count, muttering
45982. some indefinite order.
45983. 
45984. But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer's
45985. face had already sealed the order. The count looked around him. In the
45986. yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and
45987. their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at the count and
45988. moving toward the porch.
45989. 
45990. "Please step into the gallery, your excellency," said the major-domo.
45991. "What are your orders about the pictures?"
45992. 
45993. The count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to
45994. refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.
45995. 
45996. "Well, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded," he added in a
45997. soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.
45998. 
45999. At nine o'clock the countess woke up, and Matrena Timofeevna, who had
46000. been her lady's maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of
46001. chief gendarme's duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much
46002. offended and the young ladies' summer dresses could not be left behind.
46003. On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because
46004. her trunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were
46005. being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for
46006. wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered
46007. that they should take with them. The countess sent for her husband.
46008. 
46009. "What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded."
46010. 
46011. "You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer
46012. came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are
46013. things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to
46014. them!... Really now, in our own yard--we asked them in ourselves and
46015. there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them
46016. be taken... where's the hurry?"
46017. 
46018. The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters.
46019. The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of
46020. something detrimental to the children's interests, such as the building
46021. of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater
46022. or an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced
46023. in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.
46024. 
46025. She assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:
46026. "Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting
46027. nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our--all the
46028. children's property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand
46029. rubles' worth of things in the house. I don't consent, my dear, I don't!
46030. Do as you please! It's the government's business to look after the
46031. wounded; they know that. Look at the Lopukhins opposite, they cleared
46032. out everything two days ago. That's what other people do. It's only
46033. we who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the
46034. children."
46035. 
46036. Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without
46037. replying.
46038. 
46039. "Papa, what are you doing that for?" asked Natasha, who had followed him
46040. into her mother's room.
46041. 
46042. "Nothing! What business is it of yours?" muttered the count angrily.
46043. 
46044. "But I heard," said Natasha. "Why does Mamma object?"
46045. 
46046. "What business is it of yours?" cried the count.
46047. 
46048. Natasha stepped up to the window and pondered.
46049. 
46050. "Papa! Here's Berg coming to see us," said she, looking out of the
46051. window.
46052. 
46053. 
46054. 
46055. 
46056. 
46057. CHAPTER XVI
46058. 
46059. 
46060. Berg, the Rostovs' son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders
46061. of Vladimir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post
46062. of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the
46063. first division of the Second Army.
46064. 
46065. On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.
46066. 
46067. He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the
46068. army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there.
46069. So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and
46070. domestic reasons.
46071. 
46072. Berg drove up to his father-in-law's house in his spruce little trap
46073. with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He
46074. looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the
46075. porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.
46076. 
46077. From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the
46078. drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of Natasha
46079. and Sonya, and hastened to inquire after "Mamma's" health.
46080. 
46081. "Health, at a time like this?" said the count. "Come, tell us the news!
46082. Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?"
46083. 
46084. "God Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa," said
46085. Berg. "The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so
46086. to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But
46087. in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly
46088. antique valor of the Russian army, which they--which it" (he
46089. corrected himself) "has shown or displayed in the battle of the
46090. twenty-sixth--there are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you,
46091. Papa" (he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking
46092. had done, but Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his
46093. breast at the words "Russian army"), "I tell you frankly that we, the
46094. commanders, far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind,
46095. could hardly restrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique
46096. valor," he went on rapidly. "General Barclay de Tolly risked his life
46097. everywhere at the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was
46098. stationed on a hillside. You can imagine!"
46099. 
46100. And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had
46101. heard those days. Natasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused
46102. him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some
46103. question.
46104. 
46105. "Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors
46106. cannot be imagined or adequately praised!" said Berg, glancing round
46107. at Natasha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent
46108. look with a smile. "'Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of
46109. her sons!' Isn't it so, Papa?" said he.
46110. 
46111. Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and
46112. dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand,
46113. asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to
46114. express sympathy, remained standing beside her.
46115. 
46116. "Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for
46117. every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get
46118. away...."
46119. 
46120. "I can't think what the servants are about," said the countess, turning
46121. to her husband. "I have just been told that nothing is ready yet.
46122. Somebody after all must see to things. One misses Mitenka at such times.
46123. There won't be any end to it."
46124. 
46125. The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself.
46126. He got up from his chair and went to the door.
46127. 
46128. At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose
46129. and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and
46130. significantly.
46131. 
46132. "And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa," said he.
46133. 
46134. "Hm..." said the count, and stopped.
46135. 
46136. "I was driving past Yusupov's house just now," said Berg with a laugh,
46137. "when the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldn't
46138. buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a
46139. small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear Vera wanted a
46140. chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it." (At the mention
46141. of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone
46142. to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) "And it's
46143. such a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know!
46144. And dear Vera has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you
46145. see. I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me
46146. have one, I will pay the man well, and..."
46147. 
46148. The count frowned and coughed.
46149. 
46150. "Ask the countess, I don't give orders."
46151. 
46152. "If it's inconvenient, please don't," said Berg. "Only I so wanted it,
46153. for dear Vera's sake."
46154. 
46155. "Oh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil..."
46156. cried the old count. "My head's in a whirl!"
46157. 
46158. And he left the room. The countess began to cry.
46159. 
46160. "Yes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!" said Berg.
46161. 
46162. Natasha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to
46163. reach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs.
46164. 
46165. Petya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants
46166. who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the
46167. yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing
46168. into one of them helped by an orderly.
46169. 
46170. "Do you know what it's about?" Petya asked Natasha.
46171. 
46172. She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about.
46173. She did not answer.
46174. 
46175. "It's because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded," said
46176. Petya. "Vasilich told me. I consider..."
46177. 
46178. "I consider," Natasha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to
46179. Petya, "I consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I don't know what.
46180. Are we despicable Germans?"
46181. 
46182. Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and
46183. letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed
46184. headlong up the stairs.
46185. 
46186. Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful
46187. attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down
46188. the room, when Natasha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a
46189. tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps.
46190. 
46191. "It's horrid! It's abominable!" she screamed. "You can't possibly have
46192. ordered it!"
46193. 
46194. Berg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count
46195. stood still at the window and listened.
46196. 
46197. "Mamma, it's impossible: see what is going on in the yard!" she cried.
46198. "They will be left!..."
46199. 
46200. "What's the matter with you? Who are 'they'? What do you want?"
46201. 
46202. "Why, the wounded! It's impossible, Mamma. It's monstrous!... No, Mamma
46203. darling, it's not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what
46204. does it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the
46205. yard... Mamma!... It's impossible!"
46206. 
46207. The count stood by the window and listened without turning round.
46208. Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.
46209. 
46210. The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her
46211. mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn
46212. to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.
46213. 
46214. "Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?" she said, not surrendering
46215. at once.
46216. 
46217. "Mamma, darling, forgive me!"
46218. 
46219. But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband.
46220. 
46221. "My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don't understand about
46222. it," said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.
46223. 
46224. "The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen," muttered the count through
46225. tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of
46226. shame on his breast.
46227. 
46228. "Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?..." asked Natasha. "We will still
46229. take all the most necessary things."
46230. 
46231. The count nodded affirmatively, and Natasha, at the rapid pace at which
46232. she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the
46233. anteroom and downstairs into the yard.
46234. 
46235. The servants gathered round Natasha, but could not believe the strange
46236. order she brought them until the count himself, in his wife's name,
46237. confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the
46238. trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants
46239. set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed
46240. strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could
46241. be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange
46242. to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted
46243. away but that had seemed the only thing to do.
46244. 
46245. The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set
46246. eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The
46247. wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but
46248. happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread
46249. to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the
46250. Rostovs' yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts
46251. but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of
46252. unloading, once started, could not be arrested. It seemed not to matter
46253. whether all or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of
46254. china, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully
46255. packed the night before now lay about the yard, and still they went on
46256. searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and
46257. letting the wounded have another and yet another cart.
46258. 
46259. "We can take four more men," said the steward. "They can have my trap,
46260. or else what is to become of them?"
46261. 
46262. "Let them have my wardrobe cart," said the countess. "Dunyasha can go
46263. with me in the carriage."
46264. 
46265. They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a
46266. house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was bright
46267. and animated. Natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she
46268. had not known for a long time.
46269. 
46270. "What could we fasten this onto?" asked the servants, trying to fix a
46271. trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. "We must keep at least
46272. one cart."
46273. 
46274. "What's in it?" asked Natasha.
46275. 
46276. "The count's books."
46277. 
46278. "Leave it, Vasilich will put it away. It's not wanted."
46279. 
46280. The phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count
46281. Peter could sit.
46282. 
46283. "On the box. You'll sit on the box, won't you, Petya?" cried Natasha.
46284. 
46285. Sonya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was quite
46286. different from Natasha's. She was putting away the things that had to
46287. be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished, and she
46288. tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.
46289. 
46290. 
46291. 
46292. 
46293. 
46294. CHAPTER XVII
46295. 
46296. 
46297. Before two o'clock in the afternoon the Rostovs' four carriages, packed
46298. full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door. One by one
46299. the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.
46300. 
46301. The caleche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sonya's
46302. attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she was
46303. arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at
46304. the entrance.
46305. 
46306. "Whose caleche is that?" she inquired, leaning out of the carriage
46307. window.
46308. 
46309. "Why, didn't you know, Miss?" replied the maid. "The wounded prince: he
46310. spent the night in our house and is going with us."
46311. 
46312. "But who is it? What's his name?"
46313. 
46314. "It's our intended that was--Prince Bolkonski himself! They say he is
46315. dying," replied the maid with a sigh.
46316. 
46317. Sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,
46318. tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey,
46319. was pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to
46320. assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting.
46321. Natasha was not in the room.
46322. 
46323. "Mamma," said Sonya, "Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is
46324. going with us."
46325. 
46326. The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sonya's arm, glanced
46327. around.
46328. 
46329. "Natasha?" she murmured.
46330. 
46331. At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them.
46332. They knew their Natasha, and alarm as to what would happen if she heard
46333. this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.
46334. 
46335. "Natasha does not know yet, but he is going with us," said Sonya.
46336. 
46337. "You say he is dying?"
46338. 
46339. Sonya nodded.
46340. 
46341. The countess put her arms around Sonya and began to cry.
46342. 
46343. "The ways of God are past finding out!" she thought, feeling that the
46344. Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was
46345. now taking place.
46346. 
46347. "Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What's the matter?" asked Natasha, as
46348. with animated face she ran into the room.
46349. 
46350. "Nothing," answered the countess. "If everything is ready let us start."
46351. 
46352. And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face. Sonya
46353. embraced Natasha and kissed her.
46354. 
46355. Natasha looked at her inquiringly.
46356. 
46357. "What is it? What has happened?"
46358. 
46359. "Nothing... No..."
46360. 
46361. "Is it something very bad for me? What is it?" persisted Natasha with
46362. her quick intuition.
46363. 
46364. Sonya sighed and made no reply. The count, Petya, Madame Schoss, Mavra
46365. Kuzminichna, and Vasilich came into the drawing room and, having closed
46366. the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently
46367. seated without looking at one another.
46368. 
46369. The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself
46370. before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced
46371. Mavra Kuzminichna and Vasilich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while
46372. they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs
46373. lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words. The
46374. countess went into the oratory and there Sonya found her on her knees
46375. before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall.
46376. (The most precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected,
46377. were being taken with them.)
46378. 
46379. In the porch and in the yard the men whom Petya had armed with swords
46380. and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts
46381. and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind.
46382. 
46383. As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put in
46384. the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on
46385. each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the
46386. countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house
46387. to the carriages, the caleche, the phaeton, and back again.
46388. 
46389. "They always will forget everything!" said the countess. "Don't you know
46390. I can't sit like that?"
46391. 
46392. And Dunyasha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an
46393. aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the
46394. seat.
46395. 
46396. "Oh, those servants!" said the count, swaying his head.
46397. 
46398. Efim, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to
46399. drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance
46400. round at what was going on behind him. From thirty years' experience
46401. he knew it would be some time yet before the order, "Be off, in God's
46402. name!" would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said
46403. he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch
46404. something that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again
46405. be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg
46406. him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill. He knew
46407. all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen, with more
46408. patience than the horses, especially the near one, the chestnut Falcon,
46409. who was pawing the ground and champing his bit. At last all were
46410. seated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled up, the door was shut,
46411. somebody was sent for a traveling case, and the countess leaned out
46412. and said what she had to say. Then Efim deliberately doffed his hat and
46413. began crossing himself. The postilion and all the other servants did the
46414. same. "Off, in God's name!" said Efim, putting on his hat. "Start!" The
46415. postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar,
46416. the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman
46417. sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out
46418. of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted in
46419. their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In the
46420. carriages, the caleche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they
46421. passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in Moscow
46422. walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.
46423. 
46424. Rarely had Natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting in
46425. the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding
46426. walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the
46427. carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of
46428. wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see
46429. the raised hood of Prince Andrew's caleche. She did not know who was
46430. in it, but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that
46431. caleche. She knew it was right in front.
46432. 
46433. In Kudrino, from the Nikitski, Presnya, and Podnovinsk Streets came
46434. several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostovs', and as they
46435. passed along the Sadovaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows
46436. abreast.
46437. 
46438. As they were going round the Sukharev water tower Natasha, who was
46439. inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking
46440. past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:
46441. 
46442. "Dear me! Mamma, Sonya, look, it's he!"
46443. 
46444. "Who? Who?"
46445. 
46446. "Look! Yes, on my word, it's Bezukhov!" said Natasha, putting her head
46447. out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman's
46448. long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently
46449. a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the
46450. Sukharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man
46451. in a frieze coat.
46452. 
46453. "Yes, it really is Bezukhov in a coachman's coat, with a queer-looking
46454. old boy. Really," said Natasha, "look, look!"
46455. 
46456. "No, it's not he. How can you talk such nonsense?"
46457. 
46458. "Mamma," screamed Natasha, "I'll stake my head it's he! I assure you!
46459. Stop, stop!" she cried to the coachman.
46460. 
46461. But the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchanski Street came
46462. more carts and carriages, and the Rostovs were being shouted at to move
46463. on and not block the way.
46464. 
46465. In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the Rostovs
46466. all saw Pierre--or someone extraordinarily like him--in a coachman's
46467. coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a
46468. small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man
46469. noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and
46470. respectfully touching Pierre's elbow said something to him and pointed
46471. to the carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at
46472. first understand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the
46473. direction the old man indicated, he recognized Natasha, and following
46474. his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But
46475. having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.
46476. 
46477. Natasha's face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical
46478. kindliness.
46479. 
46480. "Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is
46481. wonderful!" she cried, holding out her hand to him. "What are you doing?
46482. Why are you like this?"
46483. 
46484. Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked
46485. along beside her while the coach still moved on.
46486. 
46487. "What is the matter, Count?" asked the countess in a surprised and
46488. commiserating tone.
46489. 
46490. "What? What? Why? Don't ask me," said Pierre, and looked round at
46491. Natasha whose radiant, happy expression--of which he was conscious
46492. without looking at her--filled him with enchantment.
46493. 
46494. "Are you remaining in Moscow, then?"
46495. 
46496. Pierre hesitated.
46497. 
46498. "In Moscow?" he said in a questioning tone. "Yes, in Moscow. Good-by!"
46499. 
46500. "Ah, if only I were a man? I'd certainly stay with you. How splendid!"
46501. said Natasha. "Mamma, if you'll let me, I'll stay!"
46502. 
46503. Pierre glanced absently at Natasha and was about to say something, but
46504. the countess interrupted him.
46505. 
46506. "You were at the battle, we heard."
46507. 
46508. "Yes, I was," Pierre answered. "There will be another battle
46509. tomorrow..." he began, but Natasha interrupted him.
46510. 
46511. "But what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like yourself...."
46512. 
46513. "Oh, don't ask me, don't ask me! I don't know myself. Tomorrow... But
46514. no! Good-by, good-by!" he muttered. "It's an awful time!" and dropping
46515. behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.
46516. 
46517. Natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at
46518. him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.
46519. 
46520. 
46521. 
46522. 
46523. 
46524. CHAPTER XVIII
46525. 
46526. 
46527. For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been living
46528. in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazdeev. This is how it
46529. happened.
46530. 
46531. When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his
46532. interview with Count Rostopchin, he could not for some time make out
46533. where he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that
46534. among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman
46535. who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess Helene, he felt
46536. suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which
46537. he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything was now at an end, all
46538. was in confusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or
46539. wrong, the future held nothing, and there was no escape from this
46540. position. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat
46541. down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door
46542. of the reception room and peeped through the crack, returned flourishing
46543. his arms, and took up a book. His major-domo came in a second time to
46544. say that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess
46545. was very anxious to see him if only for a minute, and that someone from
46546. Bazdeev's widow had called to ask Pierre to take charge of her husband's
46547. books, as she herself was leaving for the country.
46548. 
46549. "Oh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say I will
46550. come directly," Pierre replied to the major-domo.
46551. 
46552. But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which
46553. was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door.
46554. There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this
46555. passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with
46556. both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The hall porter was
46557. standing at the front door. From the landing where Pierre stood there
46558. was a second staircase leading to the back entrance. He went down that
46559. staircase and out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were
46560. some carriages waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate
46561. the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to
46562. him. When he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich
46563. which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen: he hung his head
46564. and quickening his pace went down the street.
46565. 
46566. Of all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph
46567. Bazdeev's books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.
46568. 
46569. He hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the
46570. Patriarch's Ponds, where the widow Bazdeev's house was.
46571. 
46572. Continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were
46573. making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky
46574. body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, Pierre,
46575. experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, began to
46576. talk to his driver.
46577. 
46578. The man told him that arms were being distributed today at the Kremlin
46579. and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills
46580. gates and a great battle would be fought there.
46581. 
46582. Having reached the Patriarch's Ponds Pierre found the Bazdeevs' house,
46583. where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the gate.
46584. Gerasim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at Torzhok five
46585. years before with Joseph Bazdeev, came out in answer to his knock.
46586. 
46587. "At home?" asked Pierre.
46588. 
46589. "Owing to the present state of things Sophia Danilovna has gone to the
46590. Torzhok estate with the children, your excellency."
46591. 
46592. "I will come in all the same, I have to look through the books," said
46593. Pierre.
46594. 
46595. "Be so good as to step in. Makar Alexeevich, the brother of my late
46596. master--may the kingdom of heaven be his--has remained here, but he is
46597. in a weak state as you know," said the old servant.
46598. 
46599. Pierre knew that Makar Alexeevich was Joseph Bazdeev's half-insane
46600. brother and a hard drinker.
46601. 
46602. "Yes, yes, I know. Let us go in..." said Pierre and entered the house.
46603. 
46604. A tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown and
46605. with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing Pierre
46606. he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.
46607. 
46608. "He was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your honor
46609. sees," said Gerasim. "Will you step into the study?" Pierre nodded. "As
46610. it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia Danilovna gave orders
46611. that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books."
46612. 
46613. Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such
46614. trepidation in his benefactor's lifetime. The room, dusty and untouched
46615. since the death of Joseph Bazdeev was now even gloomier.
46616. 
46617. Gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. Pierre
46618. went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts
46619. were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most important,
46620. the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic Scotch Acts
46621. with Bazdeev's notes and explanations. He sat down at the dusty writing
46622. table, and, having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out,
46623. closed them, finally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand
46624. sank into meditation.
46625. 
46626. Gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre
46627. always sitting in the same attitude.
46628. 
46629. More than two hours passed and Gerasim took the liberty of making a
46630. slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not
46631. hear him.
46632. 
46633. "Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?"
46634. 
46635. "Oh yes!" said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. "Look
46636. here," he added, taking Gerasim by a button of his coat and looking down
46637. at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, "I say, do you
46638. know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?"
46639. 
46640. "We heard so," replied the man.
46641. 
46642. "I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you."
46643. 
46644. "Yes, your excellency," replied Gerasim. "Will you have something to
46645. eat?"
46646. 
46647. "No, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a pistol,"
46648. said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.
46649. 
46650. "Yes, your excellency," said Gerasim after thinking for a moment.
46651. 
46652. All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor's study,
46653. and Gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and
46654. talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made up for him
46655. there.
46656. 
46657. Gerasim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things,
46658. accepted Pierre's taking up his residence in the house without
46659. surprise, and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same
46660. evening--without even asking himself what they were wanted for--he
46661. procured a coachman's coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him
46662. the pistol next day. Makar Alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling
46663. along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked
46664. ingratiatingly at Pierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward him he
46665. wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look
46666. and hurried away. It was when Pierre (wearing the coachman's coat which
46667. Gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam) was on his
46668. way with the old man to buy the pistol at the Sukharev market that he
46669. met the Rostovs.
46670. 
46671. 
46672. 
46673. 
46674. 
46675. CHAPTER XIX
46676. 
46677. 
46678. Kutuzov's order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryazan road was issued
46679. at night on the first of September.
46680. 
46681. The first troops started at once, and during the night they marched
46682. slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those nearing
46683. the town at the Dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers
46684. crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite side
46685. and blocking the streets and alleys, while endless masses of troops were
46686. bearing down on them from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm
46687. overcame them. They all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and
46688. to the fords and the boats. Kutuzov himself had driven round by side
46689. streets to the other side of Moscow.
46690. 
46691. By ten o'clock in the morning of the second of September, only the rear
46692. guard remained in the Dorogomilov suburb, where they had ample room. The
46693. main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.
46694. 
46695. At that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,
46696. Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklonny Hill looking at
46697. the panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August
46698. to the second of September, that is from the battle of Borodino to the
46699. entry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating,
46700. memorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that
46701. always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat
46702. than in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear
46703. atmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and
46704. refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights
46705. are warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and
46706. delight us continually by falling from the sky.
46707. 
46708. At ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still
46709. held.
46710. 
46711. The brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the Poklonny
46712. Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her
46713. churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas
46714. glittering like stars in the sunlight.
46715. 
46716. The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as
46717. he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious and
46718. uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has
46719. no knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full force
46720. of its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance,
46721. distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the Poklonny
46722. Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the
46723. breathing of that great and beautiful body.
46724. 
46725. Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every
46726. foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the
46727. mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.
46728. 
46729. "Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises, Moscou la sainte. La
46730. voila done enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il etait temps," * said he, and
46731. dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and
46732. summoned Lelorgne d'Ideville, the interpreter.
46733. 
46734. 
46735.      * "That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy
46736.      Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was
46737.      high time."
46738. 
46739. 
46740. "A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,"
46741. thought he (he had said so to Tuchkov at Smolensk). From that point of
46742. view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed
46743. strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable,
46744. had at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at
46745. the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance
46746. of possessing it agitated and awed him.
46747. 
46748. "But could it be otherwise?" he thought. "Here is this capital at my
46749. feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,
46750. beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what
46751. light must I appear to them!" thought he, thinking of his troops.
46752. "Here she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men," he reflected,
46753. glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and
46754. forming up. "One word from me, one movement of my hand, and that ancient
46755. capital of the Tsars would perish. But my clemency is always ready to
46756. descend upon the vanquished. I must be magnanimous and truly great. But
46757. no, it can't be true that I am in Moscow," he suddenly thought.
46758. "Yet here she is lying at my feet, with her golden domes and crosses
46759. scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine. But I shall spare her. On
46760. the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I will inscribe great
46761. words of justice and mercy.... It is just this which Alexander will
46762. feel most painfully, I know him." (It seemed to Napoleon that the chief
46763. import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between
46764. himself and Alexander.) "From the height of the Kremlin--yes, there
46765. is the Kremlin, yes--I will give them just laws; I will teach them the
46766. meaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember
46767. their conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not,
46768. and do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false
46769. policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in
46770. Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people.
46771. I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored
46772. monarch. 'Boyars,' I will say to them, 'I do not desire war, I desire
46773. the peace and welfare of all my subjects.' However, I know their
46774. presence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do:
46775. clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in
46776. Moscow? Yes, there she lies."
46777. 
46778. "Qu'on m'amene les boyars," * said he to his suite.
46779. 
46780. 
46781.     * "Bring the boyars to me."
46782. 
46783. 
46784. A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the
46785. boyars.
46786. 
46787. Two hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the
46788. same place on the Poklonny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to
46789. the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That
46790. speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.
46791. 
46792. He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to
46793. adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies
46794. at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and his own would
46795. mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the
46796. hearts of the people. Having learned that there were many charitable
46797. institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors
46798. on them all. He thought that, as in Africa he had to put on a burnoose
46799. and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must be beneficent like the Tsars.
46800. And in order finally to touch the hearts of the Russians--and being like
46801. all Frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference
46802. to ma chere, ma tendre, ma pauvre mere * --he decided that he would
46803. place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters:
46804. "This establishment is dedicated to my dear mother." Or no, it should
46805. be simply: Maison de ma Mere, *(2) he concluded. "But am I really in
46806. Moscow? Yes, here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the
46807. city so long in appearing?" he wondered.
46808. 
46809. 
46810.      * "My dear, my tender, my poor mother."
46811. 
46812.      * (2) "House of my Mother."
46813. 
46814. 
46815. Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers
46816. among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite. Those sent to
46817. fetch the deputation had returned with the news that Moscow was empty,
46818. that everyone had left it. The faces of those who were not conferring
46819. together were pale and perturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact
46820. that Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact
46821. seemed), but by the question how to tell the Emperor--without putting
46822. him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous--that he had been
46823. awaiting the boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left
46824. in Moscow but no one else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must
46825. be scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that
46826. the Emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then
46827. told the truth.
46828. 
46829. "He will have to be told, all the same," said some gentlemen of the
46830. suite. "But, gentlemen..."
46831. 
46832. The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon
46833. his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the
46834. outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under
46835. his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.
46836. 
46837. "But it's impossible..." declared the gentlemen of the suite, shrugging
46838. their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word--le
46839. ridicule...
46840. 
46841. At last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor's instinct
46842. suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out
46843. was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with his hand. A single
46844. report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops, who were already
46845. spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into the city through
46846. Tver, Kaluga, and Dorogomilov gates. Faster and faster, vying with
46847. one another, they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the
46848. clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar
46849. of mingling shouts.
46850. 
46851. Drawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as
46852. the Dorogomilov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his
46853. horse, paced for a long time by the Kammer-Kollezski rampart, awaiting
46854. the deputation.
46855. 
46856. 
46857. 
46858. 
46859. 
46860. CHAPTER XX
46861. 
46862. 
46863. Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a
46864. fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty.
46865. It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.
46866. 
46867. In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it
46868. seems as much alive as other hives.
46869. 
46870. The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday
46871. sun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of
46872. honey like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But one
46873. has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any
46874. life in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the sound
46875. that meet the beekeeper are not the same. To the beekeeper's tap on the
46876. wall of the sick hive, instead of the former instant unanimous
46877. humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly
46878. compressed, and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an
46879. aerial living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from
46880. different parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board, instead
46881. of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom, and the warm
46882. whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling
46883. with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels sounding the
46884. alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense of the
46885. hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity,
46886. like the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds of
46887. disorder. In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with
46888. honey fly timidly and shiftily. They do not sting, but crawl away from
46889. danger. Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive, and they
46890. flew out empty; now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower
46891. part of the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy bees--tamed by
46892. toil, clinging to one another's legs and drawing out the wax, with a
46893. ceaseless hum of labor--that used to hang in long clusters down to
46894. the floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately
46895. in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive. Instead of a
46896. neatly glued floor, swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings,
46897. there is a floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees
46898. scarcely moving their legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared
46899. away.
46900. 
46901. The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super.
46902. Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and
46903. keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex structures of the
46904. combs, but no longer in their former state of purity. All is neglected
46905. and foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about
46906. the combs, and the short home bees, shriveled and listless as if they
46907. were old, creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers,
46908. having lost all motive and all sense of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps,
46909. and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their
46910. flight. Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey
46911. an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of
46912. bees, by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with
46913. efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or
46914. bumblebee without knowing why they do it. In another corner two old bees
46915. are languidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another,
46916. without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile
46917. intent. In a third place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack
46918. some victim and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or
46919. killed, drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap
46920. of corpses. The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine
46921. the brood cells. In place of the former close dark circles formed by
46922. thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery
46923. of generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of
46924. bees. They have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they
46925. had guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only
46926. a few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the enemy's
46927. hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall
46928. as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark
46929. on it, and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean.
46930. 
46931. So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy, and
46932. morose, paced up and down in front of the Kammer-Kollezski rampart,
46933. awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of
46934. the proprieties--a deputation.
46935. 
46936. In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly
46937. moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they
46938. were doing.
46939. 
46940. When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was
46941. empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently
46942. continued to walk to and fro.
46943. 
46944. "My carriage!" he said.
46945. 
46946. He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the
46947. suburb. "Moscow deserted!" he said to himself. "What an incredible
46948. event!"
46949. 
46950. He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the Dorogomilov
46951. suburb.
46952. 
46953. The coup de theatre had not come off.
46954. 
46955. 
46956. 
46957. 
46958. 
46959. CHAPTER XXI
46960. 
46961. 
46962. The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o'clock at night
46963. till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the
46964. last of the inhabitants who were leaving.
46965. 
46966. The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the
46967. Stone, Moskva, and Yauza bridges.
46968. 
46969. While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the
46970. Kremlin, were thronging the Moskva and the Stone bridges, a great many
46971. soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back
46972. from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of
46973. Vasili the Beatified and under the Borovitski gate, back up the hill
46974. to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take
46975. things not belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales
46976. filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were no
46977. dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to
46978. enter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of female
46979. purchasers--but only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though without
46980. muskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way
46981. out through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen and their assistants
46982. (of whom there were but few) moved about among the soldiers quite
46983. bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked them up again, and
46984. themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants. On the
46985. square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call.
46986. But the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the
46987. direction of the drum as formerly, but made them, on the contrary, run
46988. farther away. Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were
46989. to be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven heads. Two officers, one
46990. with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse,
46991. the other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ilyinka
46992. Street, talking. A third officer galloped up to them.
46993. 
46994. "The general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail.
46995. This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed."
46996. 
46997. "Where are you off to?... Where?..." he shouted to three infantrymen
46998. without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were
46999. slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. "Stop, you rascals!"
47000. 
47001. "But how are you going to stop them?" replied another officer. "There is
47002. no getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt,
47003. that's all!"
47004. 
47005. "How can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge, and
47006. don't move. Shouldn't we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from
47007. running away?"
47008. 
47009. "Come, go in there and drive them out!" shouted the senior officer.
47010. 
47011. The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with
47012. him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a group. A
47013. shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm,
47014. persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and
47015. ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.
47016. 
47017. "Your honor!" said he. "Be so good as to protect us! We won't grudge
47018. trifles, you are welcome to anything--we shall be delighted! Pray!...
47019. I'll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman,
47020. or even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is; but what's all
47021. this--sheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be placed if only
47022. to let us close the shop...."
47023. 
47024. Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.
47025. 
47026. "Eh, what twaddle!" said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man. "When
47027. one's head is gone one doesn't weep for one's hair! Take what any of you
47028. like!" And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the
47029. officer.
47030. 
47031. "It's all very well for you, Ivan Sidorych, to talk," said the first
47032. tradesman angrily. "Please step inside, your honor!"
47033. 
47034. "Talk indeed!" cried the thin one. "In my three shops here I have a
47035. hundred thousand rubles' worth of goods. Can they be saved when the army
47036. has gone? Eh, what people! 'Against God's might our hands can't fight.'"
47037. 
47038. "Come inside, your honor!" repeated the tradesman, bowing.
47039. 
47040. The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.
47041. 
47042. "It's not my business!" he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of
47043. the passages.
47044. 
47045. From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and just
47046. as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was
47047. flung out violently.
47048. 
47049. This man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer. The
47050. officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that
47051. moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the Moskva
47052. bridge and the officer ran out into the square.
47053. 
47054. "What is it? What is it?" he asked, but his comrade was already
47055. galloping off past Vasili the Beatified in the direction from which the
47056. screams came.
47057. 
47058. The officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached the
47059. bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the bridge,
47060. several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces among the
47061. troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were
47062. harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.
47063. The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a child's chair
47064. with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and
47065. desperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers that the screams
47066. of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that
47067. General Ermolov, coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were
47068. dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge,
47069. had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the
47070. bridge. The crowd, crushing one another, upsetting carts, and shouting
47071. and squeezing desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops
47072. were now moving forward.
47073. 
47074. 
47075. 
47076. 
47077. 
47078. CHAPTER XXII
47079. 
47080. 
47081. Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone in the
47082. streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round
47083. the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard. Nobody
47084. drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard. The
47085. Povarskaya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard of the
47086. Rostovs' house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the
47087. horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great drawing
47088. room of the house, which had been left with all it contained, were
47089. two people. They were the yard porter Ignat, and the page boy Mishka,
47090. Vasilich's grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather.
47091. Mishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with
47092. one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with
47093. satisfaction before the large mirror.
47094. 
47095. "Isn't it fine, eh, Uncle Ignat?" said the boy, suddenly beginning to
47096. strike the keyboard with both hands.
47097. 
47098. "Only fancy!" answered Ignat, surprised at the broadening grin on his
47099. face in the mirror.
47100. 
47101. "Impudence! Impudence!" they heard behind them the voice of Mavra
47102. Kuzminichna who had entered silently. "How he's grinning, the fat mug!
47103. Is that what you're here for? Nothing's cleared away down there and
47104. Vasilich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!"
47105. 
47106. Ignat left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the room with
47107. meekly downcast eyes.
47108. 
47109. "Aunt, I did it gently," said the boy.
47110. 
47111. "I'll give you something gently, you monkey you!" cried Mavra
47112. Kuzminichna, raising her arm threateningly. "Go and get the samovar to
47113. boil for your grandfather."
47114. 
47115. Mavra Kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it, and
47116. with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.
47117. 
47118. Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go
47119. next--to drink tea in the servants' wing with Vasilich, or into the
47120. storeroom to put away what still lay about.
47121. 
47122. She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. Someone
47123. stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it.
47124. Mavra Kuzminichna went to the gate.
47125. 
47126. "Who do you want?"
47127. 
47128. "The count--Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov."
47129. 
47130. "And who are you?"
47131. 
47132. "An officer, I have to see him," came the reply in a pleasant, well-bred
47133. Russian voice.
47134. 
47135. Mavra Kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with the
47136. round face of a Rostov, entered the yard.
47137. 
47138. "They have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime," said
47139. Mavra Kuzminichna cordially.
47140. 
47141. The young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whether to
47142. enter or not, clicked his tongue.
47143. 
47144. "Ah, how annoying!" he muttered. "I should have come yesterday.... Ah,
47145. what a pity."
47146. 
47147. Meanwhile, Mavra Kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically
47148. examining the familiar Rostov features of the young man's face, his
47149. tattered coat and trodden-down boots.
47150. 
47151. "What did you want to see the count for?" she asked.
47152. 
47153. "Oh well... it can't be helped!" said he in a tone of vexation and
47154. placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.
47155. 
47156. He again paused in indecision.
47157. 
47158. "You see," he suddenly said, "I am a kinsman of the count's and he has
47159. been very kind to me. As you see" (he glanced with an amused air and
47160. good-natured smile at his coat and boots) "my things are worn out and I
47161. have no money, so I was going to ask the count..."
47162. 
47163. Mavra Kuzminichna did not let him finish.
47164. 
47165. "Just wait a minute, sir. One little moment," said she.
47166. 
47167. And as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and,
47168. hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the
47169. servants' quarters.
47170. 
47171. While Mavra Kuzminichna was running to her room the officer walked about
47172. the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a faint
47173. smile on his lips. "What a pity I've missed Uncle! What a nice old
47174. woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the nearest way
47175. to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near the Rogozhski
47176. gate?" thought he. Just then Mavra Kuzminichna appeared from behind
47177. the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a
47178. rolled-up check kerchief in her hand. While still a few steps from
47179. the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white
47180. twenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him.
47181. 
47182. "If his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of course...
47183. but as it is..."
47184. 
47185. Mavra Kuzminichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not
47186. decline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.
47187. 
47188. "If the count had been at home..." Mavra Kuzminichna went on
47189. apologetically. "Christ be with you, sir! May God preserve you!" said
47190. she, bowing as she saw him out.
47191. 
47192. Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer ran
47193. almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Yauza bridge to
47194. overtake his regiment.
47195. 
47196. But Mavra Kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist
47197. eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of
47198. motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.
47199. 
47200. 
47201. 
47202. 
47203. 
47204. CHAPTER XXIII
47205. 
47206. 
47207. From an unfinished house on the Varvarka, the ground floor of which was
47208. a dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches round the tables
47209. in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring,
47210. with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all laboriously singing
47211. some song or other. They were singing discordantly, arduously, and with
47212. great effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because
47213. they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall,
47214. fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His
47215. face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not
47216. been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed
47217. eyes. Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were
47218. singing, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white
47219. arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread
47220. out his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he
47221. always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were
47222. most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be
47223. bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows
47224. in the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his arm.
47225. 
47226. "Stop it!" he exclaimed peremptorily. "There's a fight, lads!" And,
47227. still rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.
47228. 
47229. The factory hands followed him. These men, who under the leadership of
47230. the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning, had brought the
47231. publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served
47232. them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy, hearing the sounds of
47233. revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into, wished
47234. to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted.
47235. 
47236. The publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when the
47237. workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern
47238. keeper, fell face downward on the pavement.
47239. 
47240. Another smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the publican
47241. with his chest.
47242. 
47243. The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and
47244. cried wildly: "They're fighting us, lads!"
47245. 
47246. At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised
47247. face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: "Police! Murder!...
47248. They've killed a man, lads!"
47249. 
47250. "Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death--killed!..." screamed a woman
47251. coming out of a gate close by.
47252. 
47253. A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.
47254. 
47255. "Haven't you robbed people enough--taking their last shirts?" said a
47256. voice addressing the publican. "What have you killed a man for, you
47257. thief?"
47258. 
47259. The tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from the
47260. publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to
47261. fight now.
47262. 
47263. "Murderer!" he shouted suddenly to the publican. "Bind him, lads!"
47264. 
47265. "I daresay you would like to bind me!" shouted the publican, pushing
47266. away the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head he
47267. flung it on the ground.
47268. 
47269. As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the
47270. workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.
47271. 
47272. "I know the law very well, mates! I'll take the matter to the captain
47273. of police. You think I won't get to him? Robbery is not permitted to
47274. anybody now a days!" shouted the publican, picking up his cap.
47275. 
47276. "Come along then! Come along then!" the publican and the tall young
47277. fellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the street
47278. together.
47279. 
47280. The bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and others
47281. followed behind, talking and shouting.
47282. 
47283. At the corner of the Moroseyka, opposite a large house with closed
47284. shutters and bearing a bootmaker's signboard, stood a score of thin,
47285. worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long tattered
47286. coats.
47287. 
47288. "He should pay folks off properly," a thin workingman, with frowning
47289. brows and a straggly beard, was saying.
47290. 
47291. "But he's sucked our blood and now he thinks he's quit of us. He's been
47292. misleading us all the week and now that he's brought us to this pass
47293. he's made off."
47294. 
47295. On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased
47296. speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving
47297. crowd.
47298. 
47299. "Where are all the folks going?"
47300. 
47301. "Why, to the police, of course!"
47302. 
47303. "I say, is it true that we have been beaten?" "And what did you think?
47304. Look what folks are saying."
47305. 
47306. Questions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage of the
47307. increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.
47308. 
47309. The tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his
47310. bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention
47311. to himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting
47312. answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds.
47313. 
47314. "He must keep order, keep the law, that's what the government is there
47315. for. Am I not right, good Christians?" said the tall youth, with a
47316. scarcely perceptible smile. "He thinks there's no government! How can
47317. one do without government? Or else there would be plenty who'd rob us."
47318. 
47319. "Why talk nonsense?" rejoined voices in the crowd. "Will they give
47320. up Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed it!
47321. Aren't there plenty of troops on the march? Let him in, indeed! That's
47322. what the government is for. You'd better listen to what people are
47323. saying," said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.
47324. 
47325. By the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered round
47326. a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.
47327. 
47328. "An ukase, they are reading an ukase! Reading an ukase!" cried voices in
47329. the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.
47330. 
47331. The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31 When
47332. the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the demand
47333. of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather
47334. tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.
47335. 
47336. "Early tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness," he read ("Sirin
47337. Highness," said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and
47338. a frown on his brow), "to consult with him to act, and to aid the army
47339. to exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part..." the reader
47340. went on, and then paused ("Do you see," shouted the youth victoriously,
47341. "he's going to clear up the whole affair for you...."), "in destroying
47342. them, and will send these visitors to the devil. I will come back to
47343. dinner, and we'll set to work. We will do, completely do, and undo these
47344. scoundrels."
47345. 
47346. The last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The tall
47347. lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had understood
47348. the last part. In particular, the words "I will come back to dinner,"
47349. evidently displeased both reader and audience. The people's minds
47350. were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly
47351. comprehensible--it was what any one of them might have said and
47352. therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest authority should
47353. not say.
47354. 
47355. They all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his lips and
47356. swayed from side to side.
47357. 
47358. "We should ask him... that's he himself?"... "Yes, ask him indeed!...
47359. Why not? He'll explain"... voices in the rear of the crowd were
47360. suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned to the police
47361. superintendent's trap which drove into the square attended by two
47362. mounted dragoons.
47363. 
47364. The superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count
47365. Rostopchin's orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that
47366. matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his
47367. pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to
47368. stop.
47369. 
47370. "What people are these?" he shouted to the men, who were moving singly
47371. and timidly in the direction of his trap.
47372. 
47373. "What people are these?" he shouted again, receiving no answer.
47374. 
47375. "Your honor..." replied the shopman in the frieze coat, "your honor, in
47376. accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count, they
47377. desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any kind of
47378. riot, but as his highest excellence said..."
47379. 
47380. "The count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued
47381. concerning you," said the superintendent of police. "Go on!" he ordered
47382. his coachman.
47383. 
47384. The crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the
47385. superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.
47386. 
47387. The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared
47388. look, said something to his coachman, and his horses increased their
47389. speed.
47390. 
47391. "It's a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!" shouted the tall
47392. youth. "Don't let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!" shouted
47393. different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.
47394. 
47395. Following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went
47396. in the direction of the Lubyanka Street.
47397. 
47398. "There now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to
47399. perish. Do they think we're dogs?" voices in the crowd were heard saying
47400. more and more frequently.
47401. 
47402. 
47403. 
47404. 
47405. 
47406. CHAPTER XXIV
47407. 
47408. 
47409. On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with
47410. Kutuzov, Count Rostopchin had returned to Moscow mortified and offended
47411. because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and
47412. because Kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the
47413. defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him
47414. at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its
47415. patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and
47416. unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this,
47417. Rostopchin had returned to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa
47418. without undressing, and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier
47419. bringing him a letter from Kutuzov. This letter requested the count to
47420. send police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army
47421. was retreating to the Ryazan road beyond Moscow. This was not news to
47422. Rostopchin. He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since
47423. his interview the previous day with Kutuzov on the Poklonny Hill but
47424. ever since the battle of Borodino, for all the generals who came to
47425. Moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to
47426. fight another battle, and since then the government property had been
47427. removed every night, and half the inhabitants had left the city
47428. with Rostopchin's own permission. Yet all the same this information
47429. astonished and irritated the count, coming as it did in the form of a
47430. simple note with an order from Kutuzov, and received at night, breaking
47431. in on his beauty sleep.
47432. 
47433. When later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchin explained his actions at
47434. this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important
47435. considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the
47436. departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this twofold aim all
47437. Rostopchin's actions appear irreproachable. "Why were the holy relics,
47438. the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed? Why
47439. were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would
47440. not be given up--and thereby ruined?" "To preserve the tranquillity
47441. of the city," explains Count Rostopchin. "Why were bundles of useless
47442. papers from the government offices, and Leppich's balloon and other
47443. articles removed?" "To leave the town empty," explains Count Rostopchin.
47444. One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action
47445. finds a justification.
47446. 
47447. All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for
47448. public tranquillity.
47449. 
47450. On what, then, was Count Rostopchin's fear for the tranquillity of
47451. Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability
47452. of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the
47453. retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to
47454. riot?
47455. 
47456. Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an
47457. insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than
47458. ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of
47459. September, and except for a mob in the governor's courtyard, assembled
47460. there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would
47461. have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people
47462. if after the battle of Borodino, when the surrender of Moscow became
47463. certain or at least probable, Rostopchin instead of exciting the people
47464. by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all
47465. the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the
47466. population plainly that the town would be abandoned.
47467. 
47468. Rostopchin, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and
47469. impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles
47470. and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to
47471. be guiding. Ever since the enemy's entry into Smolensk he had in
47472. imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling
47473. of "the heart of Russia." Not only did it seem to him (as to all
47474. administrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscow's
47475. inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by
47476. means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a coarse tone which the
47477. people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in
47478. authority. Rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of
47479. popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of
47480. relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display
47481. took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under
47482. his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though he knew
47483. it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe
47484. that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The
47485. inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were
47486. removed, this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count
47487. yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created
47488. for himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent
47489. imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he
47490. knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and
47491. did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.
47492. 
47493. All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful
47494. and had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply
47495. directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic
47496. hatred of the French.
47497. 
47498. But when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing
47499. hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not
47500. even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when
47501. self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before
47502. Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man,
47503. abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all
47504. the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by Rostopchin
47505. suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous,
47506. weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.
47507. 
47508. When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note
47509. from Kutuzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself
47510. to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state
47511. property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no
47512. longer possible to take the whole of it away.
47513. 
47514. "Who is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?" he
47515. ruminated. "Not I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow
47516. firmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains!
47517. Traitors!" he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and
47518. traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever
47519. they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in
47520. which he found himself.
47521. 
47522. All that night Count Rostopchin issued orders, for which people came to
47523. him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the count
47524. so morose and irritable.
47525. 
47526. "Your excellency, the Director of the Registrar's Department has sent
47527. for instructions... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from the
47528. University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent...
47529. asking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire Brigade?
47530. From the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of the
47531. lunatic asylum..." All night long such announcements were continually
47532. being received by the count.
47533. 
47534. To all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that
47535. orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully
47536. prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that somebody
47537. would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen.
47538. 
47539. "Oh, tell that blockhead," he said in reply to the question from the
47540. Registrar's Department, "that he should remain to guard his documents.
47541. Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They have
47542. horses, let them be off to Vladimir, and not leave them to the French."
47543. 
47544. "Your excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come:
47545. what are your commands?"
47546. 
47547. "My commands? Let them go away, that's all.... And let the lunatics
47548. out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means
47549. these other madmen to be free."
47550. 
47551. In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count
47552. Rostopchin shouted angrily at the governor:
47553. 
47554. "Do you expect me to give you two battalions--which we have not got--for
47555. a convoy? Release them, that's all about it!"
47556. 
47557. "Your excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshkov,
47558. Vereshchagin..."
47559. 
47560. "Vereshchagin! Hasn't he been hanged yet?" shouted Rostopchin. "Bring
47561. him to me!"
47562. 
47563. 
47564. 
47565. 
47566. 
47567. CHAPTER XXV
47568. 
47569. 
47570. Toward nine o'clock in the morning, when the troops were already moving
47571. through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for instructions.
47572. Those who were able to get away were going of their own accord, those
47573. who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do.
47574. 
47575. The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokolniki, and sat
47576. in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.
47577. 
47578. In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it
47579. is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is
47580. kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every
47581. administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the
47582. sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark,
47583. holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself
47584. moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding
47585. on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and
47586. the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves
47587. independently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer
47588. reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead
47589. of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant,
47590. useless, feeble man.
47591. 
47592. Rostopchin felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.
47593. 
47594. The superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to
47595. see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the
47596. horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent of
47597. police, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had
47598. received, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the
47599. courtyard and wished to see him.
47600. 
47601. Without saying a word Rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his light,
47602. luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the
47603. handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a
47604. better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front,
47605. flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The blood
47606. stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of voices was
47607. audible through the closed window.
47608. 
47609. "Is my carriage ready?" asked Rostopchin, stepping back from the window.
47610. 
47611. "It is, your excellency," replied the adjutant.
47612. 
47613. Rostopchin went again to the balcony door.
47614. 
47615. "But what do they want?" he asked the superintendent of police.
47616. 
47617. "Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your
47618. orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about
47619. treachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency--I hardly
47620. managed to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest..."
47621. 
47622. "You may go. I don't need you to tell me what to do!" exclaimed
47623. Rostopchin angrily.
47624. 
47625. He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.
47626. 
47627. "This is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done
47628. with me!" thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up
47629. within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be
47630. attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by
47631. anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it. "Here is
47632. that mob, the dregs of the people," he thought as he gazed at the crowd:
47633. "this rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a victim,"
47634. he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this
47635. thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim,
47636. something on which to vent his rage.
47637. 
47638. "Is the carriage ready?" he asked again.
47639. 
47640. "Yes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshchagin? He is
47641. waiting at the porch," said the adjutant.
47642. 
47643. "Ah!" exclaimed Rostopchin, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.
47644. 
47645. And rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony.
47646. The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and all eyes
47647. were raised to the count.
47648. 
47649. "Good morning, lads!" said the count briskly and loudly. "Thank you for
47650. coming. I'll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle
47651. with the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of
47652. Moscow. Wait for me!"
47653. 
47654. And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door
47655. behind him.
47656. 
47657. A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. "He'll
47658. settle with all the villains, you'll see! And you said the French...
47659. He'll show you what law is!" the mob were saying as if reproving one
47660. another for their lack of confidence.
47661. 
47662. A few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door,
47663. gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved
47664. eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchin, coming out there
47665. with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking someone.
47666. 
47667. "Where is he?" he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man coming
47668. round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long thin
47669. neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by
47670. short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat
47671. lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict
47672. trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots.
47673. On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute
47674. movements.
47675. 
47676. "Ah!" said Rostopchin, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young
47677. man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch.
47678. "Put him there."
47679. 
47680. The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot
47681. indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed
47682. his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and
47683. submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.
47684. 
47685. For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step
47686. the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the people, who were
47687. all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling
47688. of feet be heard.
47689. 
47690. While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step Rostopchin
47691. stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.
47692. 
47693. "Lads!" said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. "This man,
47694. Vereshchagin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing."
47695. 
47696. The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a
47697. submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated young
47698. face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At
47699. the count's first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if
47700. wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye. But Rostopchin did
47701. not look at him. A vein in the young man's long thin neck swelled like a
47702. cord and went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.
47703. 
47704. All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more
47705. hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly
47706. and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.
47707. 
47708. "He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to
47709. Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name,
47710. he has caused Moscow to perish," said Rostopchin in a sharp, even voice,
47711. but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchagin who continued to stand in
47712. the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his
47713. arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:
47714. 
47715. "Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you."
47716. 
47717. The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to
47718. one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling
47719. atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown,
47720. uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing
47721. in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place before them, all
47722. stood with wide open eyes and mouths, straining with all their strength,
47723. and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them.
47724. 
47725. "Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!"
47726. shouted Rostopchin. "Cut him down. I command it."
47727. 
47728. Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchin's voice,
47729. the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.
47730. 
47731. "Count!" exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchagin in the
47732. midst of the momentary silence that ensued, "Count! One God is above us
47733. both...." He lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck
47734. filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face.
47735. 
47736. He did not finish what he wished to say.
47737. 
47738. "Cut him down! I command it..." shouted Rostopchin, suddenly growing
47739. pale like Vereshchagin.
47740. 
47741. "Draw sabers!" cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.
47742. 
47743. Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the
47744. front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall
47745. youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood
47746. beside Vereshchagin.
47747. 
47748. "Saber him!" the dragoon officer almost whispered.
47749. 
47750. And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,
47751. struck Vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.
47752. 
47753. "Ah!" cried Vereshchagin in meek surprise, looking round with a
47754. frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him. A
47755. similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. "O Lord!"
47756. exclaimed a sorrowful voice.
47757. 
47758. But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from Vereshchagin
47759. he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. The barrier
47760. of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in
47761. check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The
47762. plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar
47763. of the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that
47764. last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks,
47765. carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was
47766. about to repeat his blow. Vereshchagin with a cry of horror, covering
47767. his head with his hands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth,
47768. against whom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and,
47769. yelling wildly, fell with him under the feet of the pressing, struggling
47770. crowd.
47771. 
47772. Some beat and tore at Vereshchagin, others at the tall youth. And the
47773. screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to
47774. rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long
47775. time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten
47776. almost to death. And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with
47777. which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were
47778. hitting, throttling, and tearing at Vereshchagin were unable to kill
47779. him, for the crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them
47780. in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or
47781. let him go.
47782. 
47783. "Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ....
47784. Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves a thief
47785. right. Use the hatchet!... What--still alive?"
47786. 
47787. Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a
47788. long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate,
47789. bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one came
47790. up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and
47791. astonishment pushed back again.
47792. 
47793. "O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?" voices
47794. in the crowd could be heard saying. "Quite a young fellow too... must
47795. have been a merchant's son. What men!... and they say he's not the right
47796. one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there's another has been
47797. beaten too--they say he's nearly done for.... Oh, the people... Aren't
47798. they afraid of sinning?..." said the same mob now, looking with pained
47799. distress at the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its
47800. livid face stained with blood and dust.
47801. 
47802. A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in
47803. his excellency's courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away.
47804. Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the
47805. ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its long neck
47806. trailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back from it.
47807. 
47808. At the moment when Vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with savage
47809. yells and swayed about him, Rostopchin suddenly turned pale and, instead
47810. of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went
47811. with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the
47812. passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The count's face was
47813. white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.
47814. 
47815. "This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,
47816. please..." said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.
47817. 
47818. Count Rostopchin was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in
47819. the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his caleche. The
47820. distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily
47821. took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in
47822. Sokolniki.
47823. 
47824. When they reached the Myasnitski Street and could no longer hear
47825. the shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with
47826. dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his
47827. subordinates. "The mob is terrible--disgusting," he said to himself
47828. in French. "They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease."
47829. "Count! One God is above us both!"--Vereshchagin's words suddenly
47830. recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this
47831. was only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchin smiled disdainfully
47832. at himself. "I had other duties," thought he. "The people had to be
47833. appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the
47834. public good"--and he began thinking of his social duties to his family
47835. and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself--not himself as
47836. Theodore Vasilyevich Rostopchin (he fancied that Theodore Vasilyevich
47837. Rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as
47838. governor, the representative of authority and of the Tsar. "Had I been
47839. simply Theodore Vasilyevich my course of action would have been quite
47840. different, but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as
47841. commander in chief."
47842. 
47843. Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer
47844. hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchin grew physically
47845. calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil
47846. his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The
47847. thought which tranquillized Rostopchin was not a new one. Since the
47848. world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed
47849. such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with
47850. this same idea. This idea is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of
47851. other people.
47852. 
47853. To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he
47854. who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies. And
47855. Rostopchin now knew it.
47856. 
47857. Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but
47858. he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully
47859. contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a
47860. criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.
47861. 
47862. "Vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death," thought Rostopchin
47863. (though the Senate had only condemned Vereshchagin to hard labor), "he
47864. was a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go unpunished and so I have
47865. killed two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim
47866. and at the same time punished a miscreant."
47867. 
47868. Having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic
47869. arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.
47870. 
47871. Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the
47872. Sokolniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering
47873. what was to come. He was driving to the Yauza bridge where he had heard
47874. that Kutuzov was. Count Rostopchin was mentally preparing the angry and
47875. stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kutuzov for his deception. He
47876. would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all
47877. the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the
47878. ruin of Russia (as Rostopchin regarded it) would fall upon his doting
47879. old head. Planning beforehand what he would say to Kutuzov, Rostopchin
47880. turned angrily in his caleche and gazed sternly from side to side.
47881. 
47882. The Sokolniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of the
47883. almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white
47884. and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and
47885. gesticulating.
47886. 
47887. One of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchin's
47888. carriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons
47889. looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and
47890. especially at the one running toward them.
47891. 
47892. Swaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering
47893. dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on
47894. Rostopchin, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him
47895. to stop. The lunatic's solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow, with
47896. its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with
47897. saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.
47898. 
47899. "Stop! Pull up, I tell you!" he cried in a piercing voice, and again
47900. shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.
47901. 
47902. Coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it.
47903. 
47904. "Thrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead. They
47905. stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall rise.
47906. They have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown... Thrice
47907. will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!" he cried, raising his
47908. voice higher and higher.
47909. 
47910. Count Rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed
47911. in on Vereshchagin. He turned away. "Go fas... faster!" he cried in a
47912. trembling voice to his coachman. The caleche flew over the ground as
47913. fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count Rostopchin
47914. still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the
47915. distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened,
47916. bloodstained face of "the traitor" in the fur-lined coat.
47917. 
47918. Recent as that mental picture was, Rostopchin already felt that it had
47919. cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clearly that
47920. the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time, but that
47921. the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart ever more
47922. cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He seemed still to hear
47923. the sound of his own words: "Cut him down! I command it...."
47924. 
47925. "Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said them....
47926. I need not have said them," he thought. "And then nothing would have
47927. happened." He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon
47928. who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the
47929. fur-lined coat had turned upon him. "But I did not do it for my own
47930. sake. I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public
47931. welfare," thought he.
47932. 
47933. Troops were still crowding at the Yauza bridge. It was hot. Kutuzov,
47934. dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his
47935. whip in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily. A man in a general's
47936. uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutuzov and said something
47937. in French. It was Count Rostopchin. He told Kutuzov that he had come
47938. because Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army remained.
47939. 
47940. "Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told
47941. me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this
47942. would not have happened," he said.
47943. 
47944. Kutuzov looked at Rostopchin as if, not grasping what was said to him,
47945. he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the
47946. face of the man addressing him. Rostopchin grew confused and became
47947. silent. Kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating
47948. gaze from Rostopchin's face muttered softly:
47949. 
47950. "No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!"
47951. 
47952. Whether Kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when
47953. he spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be
47954. meaningless, at any rate Rostopchin made no reply and hastily left him.
47955. And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count Rostopchin,
47956. took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts
47957. to drive on the carts that blocked the way.
47958. 
47959. 
47960. 
47961. 
47962. 
47963. CHAPTER XXVI
47964. 
47965. 
47966. Toward four o'clock in the afternoon Murat's troops were entering
47967. Moscow. In front rode a detachment of Wurttemberg hussars and behind
47968. them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.
47969. 
47970. About the middle of the Arbat Street, near the Church of the Miraculous
47971. Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced
47972. detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel, le
47973. Kremlin.
47974. 
47975. Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow. They
47976. all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired commander
47977. dressed up in feathers and gold.
47978. 
47979. "Is that their Tsar himself? He's not bad!" low voices could be heard
47980. saying.
47981. 
47982. An interpreter rode up to the group.
47983. 
47984. "Take off your cap... your caps!" These words went from one to another
47985. in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if
47986. it was far to the Kremlin. The porter, listening in perplexity to the
47987. unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was
47988. speaking Russian, did not understand what was being said to him and
47989. slipped behind the others.
47990. 
47991. Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian
47992. army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several
47993. voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer,
47994. returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported
47995. that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was
47996. probably an ambuscade there.
47997. 
47998. "Good!" said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite,
47999. ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.
48000. 
48001. The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced
48002. up the Arbat. When they reached the end of the Vozdvizhenka Street they
48003. halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers superintended the
48004. placing of the guns and looked at the Kremlin through field glasses.
48005. 
48006. The bells in the Kremlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound
48007. troubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few
48008. infantrymen ran to the Kutafyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had been
48009. put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as
48010. an officer and men began to run toward it. A general who was standing
48011. by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and the latter
48012. ran back again with his men.
48013. 
48014. The sound of three more shots came from the gate.
48015. 
48016. One shot struck a French soldier's foot, and from behind the screens
48017. came the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a
48018. word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of
48019. the French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined
48020. concentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from
48021. the marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the Vozdvizhenka,
48022. Mokhavaya, or Kutafyev Street, nor the Troitsa Gate (places familiar in
48023. Moscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary.
48024. And all made ready for that battle. The cries from the gates ceased. The
48025. guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks,
48026. and an officer gave the word "Fire!" This was followed by two whistling
48027. sounds of canister shot, one after another. The shot rattled against
48028. the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens, and two
48029. wavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square.
48030. 
48031. A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the
48032. stone-built Kremlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above
48033. their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the
48034. air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound
48035. came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared
48036. the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasant's coat. He grasped a musket
48037. and took aim at the French. "Fire!" repeated the officer once more,
48038. and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard
48039. simultaneously. The gate was again hidden by smoke.
48040. 
48041. Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers
48042. and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and
48043. four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall,
48044. toward the Znamenka.
48045. 
48046. "Clear that away!" said the officer, pointing to the beams and the
48047. corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw
48048. the corpses over the parapet.
48049. 
48050. Who these men were nobody knew. "Clear that away!" was all that was said
48051. of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that
48052. they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to
48053. their memory: "These wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having
48054. supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal, and fired" (the
48055. wretches) "at the French. Some of them were sabered and the Kremlin was
48056. purged of their presence."
48057. 
48058. Murat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered
48059. the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the
48060. windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square
48061. for fuel and kindled fires there.
48062. 
48063. Other detachments passed through the Kremlin and encamped along
48064. the Moroseyka, the Lubyanka, and Pokrovka Streets. Others quartered
48065. themselves along the Vozdvizhenka, the Nikolski, and the Tverskoy
48066. Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were
48067. not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as
48068. in a camp.
48069. 
48070. Though tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their
48071. original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It
48072. was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But
48073. it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their
48074. different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various regiments began
48075. to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost
48076. forever and there came into being something nondescript, neither
48077. citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When five weeks
48078. later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army. They
48079. were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which
48080. seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man when he left
48081. Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep
48082. what he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow
48083. neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its
48084. fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the
48085. French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they
48086. carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was as
48087. impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let
48088. go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow
48089. district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms
48090. and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and
48091. walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were
48092. busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open
48093. coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading
48094. and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening,
48095. amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both
48096. in the shops and houses--but there was no army.
48097. 
48098. Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day
48099. forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any
48100. violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call
48101. for that very evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had
48102. till then constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted
48103. city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of
48104. cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field, but gets out
48105. of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich
48106. pastures, so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city.
48107. 
48108. No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers--like water
48109. percolating through sand--spread irresistibly through the city in all
48110. directions from the Kremlin into which they had first marched. The
48111. cavalry, on entering a merchant's house that had been abandoned and
48112. finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on,
48113. all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of
48114. them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and
48115. quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had
48116. had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to
48117. see the city and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed
48118. to places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers
48119. followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing
48120. the same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and
48121. generals flocked there to select caleches and coaches for themselves.
48122. The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to
48123. their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered.
48124. There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around
48125. the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored
48126. and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found.
48127. And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is
48128. spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and
48129. mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the
48130. rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction
48131. of both the army and the wealthy city.
48132. 
48133. 
48134. The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme feroce de
48135. Rostopchine, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality,
48136. however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning
48137. of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible
48138. for it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which
48139. any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it
48140. had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted
48141. Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on
48142. which sparks continually fall for several days. A town built of wood,
48143. where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners
48144. are in residence and a police force is present, cannot help burning when
48145. its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke
48146. pipes, make campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and
48147. cook themselves meals twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to
48148. billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in
48149. that district immediately increases. How much then must the probability
48150. of fire be increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops
48151. are quartered. "Le patriotisme feroce de Rostopchine" and the barbarity
48152. of the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by
48153. the soldiers' pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of
48154. enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even if there was any
48155. arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any reason to burn the
48156. houses--in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do), arson
48157. cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same thing would have happened
48158. without any incendiarism.
48159. 
48160. 
48161.     * To Rostopchin's ferocious patriotism.
48162. 
48163. 
48164. However tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchin's
48165. ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later
48166. on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is
48167. impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the
48168. fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house must
48169. burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to
48170. live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it
48171. is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained
48172. in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like
48173. Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its inhabitants
48174. abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt, nor
48175. bring them the keys of the city.
48176. 
48177. 
48178. 
48179. 
48180. 
48181. CHAPTER XXVII
48182. 
48183. 
48184. The absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it did,
48185. only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the
48186. second of September.
48187. 
48188. After the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances,
48189. Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely obsessed
48190. by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had
48191. taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past,
48192. understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to
48193. him like a dream.
48194. 
48195. He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life's demands
48196. that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable
48197. to unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alexeevich's house, on the plea of
48198. sorting the deceased's books and papers, only in search of rest from
48199. life's turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph Alexeevich was
48200. connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite
48201. contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being
48202. drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph Alexeevich's study he
48203. really found it. When he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table
48204. in the deathlike stillness of the study, calm and significant memories
48205. of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination,
48206. particularly of the battle of Borodino and of that vague sense of his
48207. own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth, simplicity,
48208. and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they. When
48209. Gerasim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking
48210. part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected. And
48211. with that object he had asked Gerasim to get him a peasant's coat and
48212. a pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph
48213. Alexeevich's house and keeping his name secret. Then during the first
48214. day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his
48215. attention on the Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea
48216. that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of
48217. his name in connection with Bonaparte's more than once vaguely presented
48218. itself. But the idea that he, L'russe Besuhof, was destined to set a
48219. limit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that
48220. often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.
48221. 
48222. When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among
48223. the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the Rostovs and
48224. Natasha had said to him: "Are you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!"
48225. the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing,
48226. even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was
48227. predestined to do.
48228. 
48229. Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in
48230. any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he
48231. returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he
48232. suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility
48233. had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in
48234. Moscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and
48235. either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe--which it seemed
48236. to him was solely due to Napoleon.
48237. 
48238. Pierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte's life in 1809
48239. by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot.
48240. And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his
48241. design excited him still more.
48242. 
48243. Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose.
48244. The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in
48245. view of the common calamity, the same feeling that had caused him to go
48246. to Mozhaysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick
48247. of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and, in
48248. place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep
48249. on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as Gerasim.
48250. The other was that vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for
48251. everything conventional, artificial, and human--for everything the
48252. majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world. Pierre had
48253. first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the Sloboda
48254. Palace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and life--all that
48255. men so painstakingly acquire and guard--if it has any worth has so only
48256. by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced.
48257. 
48258. It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last
48259. penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no
48260. apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he
48261. possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from
48262. an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal
48263. power and strength, affirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman
48264. criterion of life.
48265. 
48266. From the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time
48267. at the Sloboda Palace he had been continuously under its influence, but
48268. only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre
48269. was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he
48270. had already done in that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like
48271. everyone else, his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and
48272. his announcement to the Rostovs that he would remain in Moscow would all
48273. become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to
48274. this Pierre was very sensitive.
48275. 
48276. Pierre's physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded to his
48277. mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank during
48278. those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty unchanged linen,
48279. two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding--all
48280. this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.
48281. 
48282. It was two o'clock in the afternoon. The French had already entered
48283. Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about
48284. his undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his
48285. fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the
48286. blow or the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and
48287. melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.
48288. 
48289. "Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!" he thought.
48290. "Yes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger?
48291. But that is all the same! 'It is not I but the hand of Providence that
48292. punishes thee,' I shall say," thought he, imagining what he would say
48293. when killing Napoleon. "Well then, take me and execute me!" he went on,
48294. speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression.
48295. 
48296. While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself
48297. in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared
48298. the figure of Makar Alexeevich, always so timid before but now quite
48299. transformed.
48300. 
48301. His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He
48302. was obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but
48303. noticing embarrassment on Pierre's face immediately grew bold and,
48304. staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.
48305. 
48306. "They're frightened," he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. "I say I
48307. won't surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?"
48308. 
48309. He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it
48310. with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.
48311. 
48312. Gerasim and the porter, who had followed Makar Alexeevich, stopped him
48313. in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre, coming
48314. out into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy
48315. old man. Makar Alexeevich, frowning with exertion, held on to the pistol
48316. and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic fancy in his head.
48317. 
48318. "To arms! Board them! No, you shan't get it," he yelled.
48319. 
48320. "That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness--please, sir, to
48321. let go! Please, sir..." pleaded Gerasim, trying carefully to steer Makar
48322. Alexeevich by the elbows back to the door.
48323. 
48324. "Who are you? Bonaparte!..." shouted Makar Alexeevich.
48325. 
48326. "That's not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to
48327. have the pistol."
48328. 
48329. "Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?" shouted Makar
48330. Alexeevich, brandishing the pistol. "Board them!"
48331. 
48332. "Catch hold!" whispered Gerasim to the porter.
48333. 
48334. They seized Makar Alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the door.
48335. 
48336. The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of
48337. a tipsy, hoarse voice.
48338. 
48339. Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from
48340. the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.
48341. 
48342. "It's them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!" she
48343. cried.
48344. 
48345. Gerasim and the porter let Makar Alexeevich go, and in the now silent
48346. corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be
48347. heard.
48348. 
48349. 
48350. 
48351. 
48352. 
48353. CHAPTER XXVIII
48354. 
48355. 
48356. Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would
48357. disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the
48358. half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon
48359. as the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did not
48360. retire--an irresistible curiosity kept him there.
48361. 
48362. There were two of them. One was an officer--a tall, soldierly, handsome
48363. man--the other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, short, and
48364. thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull expression. The officer walked in
48365. front, leaning on a stick and slightly limping. When he had advanced
48366. a few steps he stopped, having apparently decided that these were good
48367. quarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in
48368. a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done
48369. that, the officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his
48370. mustache and lightly touched his hat.
48371. 
48372. "Bonjour, la compagnie!" * said he gaily, smiling and looking about him.
48373. 
48374. 
48375.     * "Good day, everybody!"
48376. 
48377. 
48378. No one gave any reply.
48379. 
48380. "Vous etes le bourgeois?" * the officer asked Gerasim.
48381. 
48382. 
48383.     * "Are you the master here?"
48384. 
48385. 
48386. Gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.
48387. 
48388. "Quartier, quartier, logement!" said the officer, looking down at the
48389. little man with a condescending and good-natured smile. "Les francais
48390. sont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fachons pas, mon
48391. vieux!" * added he, clapping the scared and silent Gerasim on the
48392. shoulder. "Well, does no one speak French in this establishment?" he
48393. asked again in French, looking around and meeting Pierre's eyes. Pierre
48394. moved away from the door.
48395. 
48396. 
48397.      * "Quarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good
48398.      fellows. What the devil! There, don't let us be cross, old
48399.      fellow!"
48400. 
48401. 
48402. Again the officer turned to Gerasim and asked him to show him the rooms
48403. in the house.
48404. 
48405. "Master, not here--don't understand... me, you..." said Gerasim, trying
48406. to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.
48407. 
48408. Still smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before Gerasim's
48409. nose, intimating that he did not understand him either, and moved,
48410. limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre wished to go
48411. away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Makar Alexeevich
48412. appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand. With
48413. a madman's cunning, Makar Alexeevich eyed the Frenchman, raised his
48414. pistol, and took aim.
48415. 
48416. "Board them!" yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing
48417. the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw
48418. himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the
48419. pistol Makar Alexeevich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there
48420. was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The
48421. Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.
48422. 
48423. Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre,
48424. snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer
48425. and addressed him in French.
48426. 
48427. "You are not wounded?" he asked.
48428. 
48429. "I think not," answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. "But I have
48430. had a lucky escape this time," he added, pointing to the damaged plaster
48431. of the wall. "Who is that man?" said he, looking sternly at Pierre.
48432. 
48433. "Oh, I am really in despair at what has occurred," said Pierre rapidly,
48434. quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. "He is an unfortunate
48435. madman who did not know what he was doing."
48436. 
48437. The officer went up to Makar Alexeevich and took him by the collar.
48438. 
48439. Makar Alexeevich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to
48440. fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.
48441. 
48442. "Brigand! You shall pay for this," said the Frenchman, letting go
48443. of him. "We French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon
48444. traitors," he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic
48445. gesture.
48446. 
48447. Pierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold that
48448. drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence with the
48449. same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For
48450. a few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a
48451. melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.
48452. 
48453. "You have saved my life. You are French," said he.
48454. 
48455. For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman could
48456. perform a great deed, and to save his life--the life of M. Ramballe,
48457. captain of the 13th Light Regiment--was undoubtedly a very great deed.
48458. 
48459. But however indubitable that conclusion and the officer's conviction
48460. based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.
48461. 
48462. "I am Russian," he said quickly.
48463. 
48464. "Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others," said the officer, waving his
48465. finger before his nose and smiling. "You shall tell me all about that
48466. presently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what are we
48467. to do with this man?" he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a
48468. brother.
48469. 
48470. Even if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that loftiest
48471. of human appellations he could not renounce it, said the officer's look
48472. and tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who Makar
48473. Alexeevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile
48474. had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from
48475. him, and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.
48476. 
48477. The Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his
48478. arm.
48479. 
48480. "You have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant it
48481. you. Lead that man away!" said he quickly and energetically, and taking
48482. the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his
48483. life, he went with him into the room.
48484. 
48485. The soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage asking
48486. what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits,
48487. but the officer sternly checked them.
48488. 
48489. "You will be called in when you are wanted," he said.
48490. 
48491. The soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile had time
48492. to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.
48493. 
48494. "Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen," said he.
48495. "Shall I serve them up?"
48496. 
48497. "Yes, and some wine," answered the captain.
48498. 
48499. 
48500. 
48501. 
48502. 
48503. CHAPTER XXIX
48504. 
48505. 
48506. When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again
48507. thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to
48508. go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite,
48509. amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his
48510. life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in
48511. the parlor--the first room they entered. To Pierre's assurances that he
48512. was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone
48513. could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and
48514. said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it
48515. be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude
48516. for saving his life.
48517. 
48518. Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the
48519. feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre's feelings
48520. were, the latter would probably have left him, but the man's animated
48521. obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.
48522. 
48523. "A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito," said the officer, looking
48524. at Pierre's fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger.
48525. "I owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never
48526. forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That
48527. is all I can say."
48528. 
48529. There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the
48530. word) in the officer's voice, in the expression of his face and in
48531. his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the
48532. Frenchman's smile, pressed the hand held out to him.
48533. 
48534. "Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion
48535. of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September," he introduced
48536. himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under
48537. his mustache. "Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have
48538. the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance
48539. with that maniac's bullet in my body?"
48540. 
48541. Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,
48542. began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for
48543. concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.
48544. 
48545. "Oh, please!" said he. "I understand your reasons. You are an officer...
48546. a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. That's not
48547. my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at
48548. your service. You belong to the gentry?" he concluded with a shade of
48549. inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. "Your baptismal name, if you
48550. please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... That's all I
48551. want to know."
48552. 
48553. When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka
48554. brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar
48555. and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and
48556. himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man,
48557. munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking
48558. his lips, and repeating--"Excellent! Delicious!" His face grew red and
48559. was covered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner
48560. with pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan
48561. and placed a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass,
48562. taken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known
48563. to the French and had been given a special name. They called it limonade
48564. de cochon (pig's lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de
48565. cochon he had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they
48566. had taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and
48567. applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up
48568. to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
48569. Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain
48570. still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.
48571. 
48572. "Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for
48573. saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my
48574. body already. Here is one I got at Wagram" (he touched his side) "and a
48575. second at Smolensk"--he showed a scar on his cheek--"and this leg which
48576. as you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the
48577. great battle of la Moskowa. Sacre Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of
48578. fire was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word!
48579. You may be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught
48580. there, I should be ready to begin again. I pity those who did not see
48581. it."
48582. 
48583. "I was there," said Pierre.
48584. 
48585. "Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The
48586. great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!" continued the Frenchman. "And
48587. you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three times--sure as I sit
48588. here. Three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown
48589. back like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your
48590. grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six
48591. times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of
48592. Naples, who knows what's what, cried 'Bravo!' Ha, ha! So you are one of
48593. us soldiers!" he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. "So much
48594. the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle...
48595. gallant... with the fair" (he winked and smiled), "that's what the
48596. French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren't they?"
48597. 
48598. The captain was so naively and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so
48599. pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily
48600. at him. Probably the word "gallant" turned the captain's thoughts to the
48601. state of Moscow.
48602. 
48603. "Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left
48604. Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?"
48605. 
48606. "Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?"
48607. asked Pierre.
48608. 
48609. "Ha, ha, ha!" The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting
48610. Pierre on the shoulder. "What a thing to say!" he exclaimed. "Paris?...
48611. But Paris, Paris..."
48612. 
48613. "Paris--the capital of the world," Pierre finished his remark for him.
48614. 
48615. The captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the
48616. middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.
48617. 
48618. "Well, if you hadn't told me you were Russian, I should have wagered
48619. that you were Parisian! You have that... I don't know what, that..." and
48620. having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.
48621. 
48622. "I have been in Paris. I spent years there," said Pierre.
48623. 
48624. "Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn't know Paris
48625. is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la
48626. Duchenois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards," and noticing that
48627. his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly:
48628. "There is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have
48629. remained Russian. Well, I don't esteem you the less for it."
48630. 
48631. Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had
48632. spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed
48633. talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.
48634. 
48635. "To return to your ladies--I hear they are lovely. What a wretched idea
48636. to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is
48637. in Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants,
48638. now--that's another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know
48639. us better than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome,
48640. Warsaw, all the world's capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved.
48641. We are nice to know. And then the Emperor..." he began, but Pierre
48642. interrupted him.
48643. 
48644. "The Emperor," Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and
48645. embarrassed, "is the Emperor...?"
48646. 
48647. "The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius--that's
48648. what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you
48649. I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But
48650. that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist
48651. the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France.
48652. When I understood what he wanted--when I saw that he was preparing a bed
48653. of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: 'That is a monarch,' and
48654. I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest
48655. man of the ages past or future."
48656. 
48657. "Is he in Moscow?" Pierre stammered with a guilty look.
48658. 
48659. The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.
48660. 
48661. "No, he will make his entry tomorrow," he replied, and continued his
48662. talk.
48663. 
48664. Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at
48665. the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some Wurttemberg hussars had
48666. come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain's
48667. horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did
48668. not understand what was said to them in French.
48669. 
48670. The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice
48671. asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer,
48672. and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already
48673. occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the two first
48674. questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding
48675. officer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand
48676. said, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the
48677. quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to
48678. occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German,
48679. translated what the German said to the captain and gave the captain's
48680. reply to the Wurttemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what
48681. was said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The
48682. captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.
48683. 
48684. When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as
48685. before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He
48686. really was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and he
48687. was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position
48688. he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy
48689. conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as
48690. that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the moment. He was
48691. tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of
48692. wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had
48693. destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last
48694. few days and which was essential for the execution of his design. The
48695. pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the
48696. town next day. Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and
48697. worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not
48698. do it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not
48699. carry out his intention. He struggled against the confession of his
48700. weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his
48701. former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and
48702. self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first
48703. man he met.
48704. 
48705. The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.
48706. 
48707. The Frenchman's chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled
48708. him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which
48709. he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. "I will go away
48710. immediately. I won't say another word to him," thought Pierre. He
48711. thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of
48712. weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but
48713. could not do so.
48714. 
48715. The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and
48716. down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he
48717. were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.
48718. 
48719. "The colonel of those Wurttembergers is delightful," he suddenly said.
48720. "He's a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he's a German."
48721. He sat down facing Pierre. "By the way, you know German, then?"
48722. 
48723. Pierre looked at him in silence.
48724. 
48725. "What is the German for 'shelter'?"
48726. 
48727. "Shelter?" Pierre repeated. "The German for shelter is Unterkunft."
48728. 
48729. "How do you say it?" the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.
48730. 
48731. "Unterkunft," Pierre repeated.
48732. 
48733. "Onterkoff," said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with
48734. laughing eyes. "These Germans are first-rate fools, don't you think so,
48735. Monsieur Pierre?" he concluded.
48736. 
48737. "Well, let's have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we?
48738. Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!" he called out
48739. gaily.
48740. 
48741. Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre
48742. by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression
48743. on his companion's face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in
48744. his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.
48745. 
48746. "There now, we're sad," said he, touching Pierre's hand. "Have I
48747. upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?" he asked Pierre.
48748. "Perhaps it's the state of affairs?"
48749. 
48750. Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman's eyes
48751. whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.
48752. 
48753. "Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for
48754. you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death.
48755. I say it with my hand on my heart!" said he, striking his chest.
48756. 
48757. "Thank you," said Pierre.
48758. 
48759. The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that
48760. "shelter" was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly brightened.
48761. 
48762. "Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!" he cried gaily, filling
48763. two glasses with wine.
48764. 
48765. Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too,
48766. again pressed Pierre's hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a
48767. pensive attitude.
48768. 
48769. "Yes, my dear friend," he began, "such is fortune's caprice. Who would
48770. have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the
48771. service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow
48772. with him. I must tell you, mon cher," he continued in the sad and
48773. measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, "that our name
48774. is one of the most ancient in France."
48775. 
48776. And with a Frenchman's easy and naive frankness the captain told Pierre
48777. the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all
48778. about his relations and his financial and family affairs, "ma pauvre
48779. mere" playing of course an important part in the story.
48780. 
48781. "But all that is only life's setting, the real thing is love--love! Am I
48782. not right, Monsieur Pierre?" said he, growing animated. "Another glass?"
48783. 
48784. Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.
48785. 
48786. "Oh, women, women!" and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at
48787. Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.
48788. 
48789. There were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking
48790. at the officer's handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager
48791. enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe's love
48792. stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special
48793. charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such sincere
48794. conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love
48795. and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with
48796. curiosity.
48797. 
48798. It was plain that l'amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not
48799. that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor
48800. was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for
48801. Natasha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one
48802. he considered the "love of clodhoppers" and the other the "love
48803. of simpletons.") L'amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted
48804. principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a
48805. combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.
48806. 
48807. Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a
48808. fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming,
48809. innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The
48810. conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in
48811. the mother's sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage
48812. to her lover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of
48813. a distant past. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband
48814. played the part of the lover, and he--the lover--assumed the role of the
48815. husband, as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of
48816. Germany, where "shelter" is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat
48817. sauerkraut and the young girls are "too blonde."
48818. 
48819. Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain's
48820. memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was
48821. of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of
48822. life continually occurred in the captain's stories) and the Pole had
48823. entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de coeur) while himself
48824. entering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting
48825. Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the
48826. captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: "I have
48827. saved your life, and I save your honor!" Having repeated these words the
48828. captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the
48829. weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.
48830. 
48831. Listening to the captain's tales, Pierre--as often happens late in the
48832. evening and under the influence of wine--followed all that was told him,
48833. understood it all, and at the same time followed a train of personal
48834. memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind. While
48835. listening to these love stories his own love for Natasha unexpectedly
48836. rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that love in his
48837. imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe's tales. Listening
48838. to the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before
48839. his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of
48840. his love at the Sukharev water tower. At the time of that meeting it had
48841. not produced an effect upon him--he had not even once recalled it. But
48842. now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very
48843. important and poetic.
48844. 
48845. "Peter Kirilovich, come here! We have recognized you," he now seemed
48846. to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her
48847. smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there
48848. seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.
48849. 
48850. Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain
48851. asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice
48852. himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.
48853. 
48854. Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to
48855. express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he
48856. understood love for a women somewhat differently. He said that in all
48857. his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could
48858. never be his.
48859. 
48860. "Tiens!" said the captain.
48861. 
48862. Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest
48863. years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too
48864. young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.
48865. Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of
48866. her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in
48867. the world, and especially therefore above himself.
48868. 
48869. When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he
48870. understood that.
48871. 
48872. The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand
48873. it he begged Pierre to continue.
48874. 
48875. "Platonic love, clouds..." he muttered.
48876. 
48877. Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the
48878. thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who
48879. played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together,
48880. something loosened Pierre's tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway
48881. look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his
48882. marriage, Natasha's love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and
48883. all his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe's questions
48884. he also told what he had at first concealed--his own position and even
48885. his name.
48886. 
48887. More than anything else in Pierre's story the captain was impressed by
48888. the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that
48889. he had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there
48890. concealing his name and station.
48891. 
48892. When it was late at night they went out together into the street. The
48893. night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokrovka a
48894. fire glowed--the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the
48895. right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
48896. opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierre's
48897. heart with his love. At the gate stood Gerasim, the cook, and two
48898. Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in
48899. two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the
48900. town.
48901. 
48902. There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense
48903. city.
48904. 
48905. Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the
48906. glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. "There now,
48907. how good it is, what more does one need?" thought he. And suddenly
48908. remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned
48909. against the fence to save himself from falling.
48910. 
48911. Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with
48912. unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and
48913. immediately fell asleep.
48914. 
48915. 
48916. 
48917. 
48918. 
48919. CHAPTER XXX
48920. 
48921. 
48922. The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was
48923. watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the
48924. retreating troops, with many different feelings.
48925. 
48926. The Rostov party spent the night at Mytishchi, fourteen miles from
48927. Moscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road
48928. had been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been
48929. forgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided to
48930. spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning
48931. they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far
48932. as Great Mytishchi. At ten o'clock that evening the Rostov family and
48933. the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and
48934. huts of that large village. The Rostovs' servants and coachmen and the
48935. orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to their masters, had
48936. supper, fed the horses, and came out into the porches.
48937. 
48938. In a neighboring hut lay Raevski's adjutant with a fractured wrist. The
48939. awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his
48940. moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had
48941. spent the first night in the same yard as the Rostovs. The countess said
48942. she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at
48943. Mytishchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the
48944. wounded man.
48945. 
48946. In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high
48947. body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another
48948. fire. One glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was
48949. Little Mytishchi burning--set on fire by Mamonov's Cossacks.
48950. 
48951. "But look here, brothers, there's another fire!" remarked an orderly.
48952. 
48953. All turned their attention to the glow.
48954. 
48955. "But they told us Little Mytishchi had been set on fire by Mamonov's
48956. Cossacks."
48957. 
48958. "But that's not Mytishchi, it's farther away."
48959. 
48960. "Look, it must be in Moscow!"
48961. 
48962. Two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down
48963. on its steps.
48964. 
48965. "It's more to the left, why, Little Mytishchi is over there, and this is
48966. right on the other side."
48967. 
48968. Several men joined the first two.
48969. 
48970. "See how it's flaring," said one. "That's a fire in Moscow: either in
48971. the Sushchevski or the Rogozhski quarter."
48972. 
48973. No one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently
48974. at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.
48975. 
48976. Old Daniel Terentich, the count's valet (as he was called), came up to
48977. the group and shouted at Mishka.
48978. 
48979. "What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be
48980. calling and there's nobody there; go and gather the clothes together."
48981. 
48982. "I only ran out to get some water," said Mishka.
48983. 
48984. "But what do you think, Daniel Terentich? Doesn't it look as if that
48985. glow were in Moscow?" remarked one of the footmen.
48986. 
48987. Daniel Terentich made no reply, and again for a long time they were all
48988. silent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.
48989. 
48990. "God have mercy.... It's windy and dry..." said another voice.
48991. 
48992. "Just look! See what it's doing now. O Lord! You can even see the crows
48993. flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!"
48994. 
48995. "They'll put it out, no fear!"
48996. 
48997. "Who's to put it out?" Daniel Terentich, who had hitherto been silent,
48998. was heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. "Moscow it is,
48999. brothers," said he. "Mother Moscow, the white..." his voice faltered,
49000. and he gave way to an old man's sob.
49001. 
49002. And it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the
49003. significance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were heard,
49004. words of prayer, and the sobbing of the count's old valet.
49005. 
49006. 
49007. 
49008. 
49009. 
49010. CHAPTER XXXI
49011. 
49012. 
49013. The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was
49014. burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look. Sonya
49015. and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him. Only
49016. Natasha and the countess remained in the room. Petya was no longer
49017. with the family, he had gone on with his regiment which was making for
49018. Troitsa.
49019. 
49020. The countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry. Natasha,
49021. pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just
49022. where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father's
49023. words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three
49024. houses off.
49025. 
49026. "Oh, how terrible," said Sonya returning from the yard chilled and
49027. frightened. "I believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there's an awful
49028. glow! Natasha, do look! You can see it from the window," she said to her
49029. cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.
49030. 
49031. But Natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her
49032. and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in
49033. this condition of stupor since the morning, when Sonya, to the surprise
49034. and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found
49035. it necessary to tell Natasha of Prince Andrew's wound and of his being
49036. with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as
49037. she was with Sonya. Sonya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now,
49038. as if trying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her
49039. cousin.
49040. 
49041. "Look, Natasha, how dreadfully it is burning!" said she.
49042. 
49043. "What's burning?" asked Natasha. "Oh, yes, Moscow."
49044. 
49045. And as if in order not to offend Sonya and to get rid of her, she turned
49046. her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident
49047. that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former
49048. attitude.
49049. 
49050. "But you didn't see it!"
49051. 
49052. "Yes, really I did," Natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left
49053. in peace.
49054. 
49055. Both the countess and Sonya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow
49056. nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to
49057. Natasha.
49058. 
49059. The count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went
49060. up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she
49061. was wont to do when Natasha was ill, then touched her forehead with her
49062. lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.
49063. 
49064. "You are cold. You are trembling all over. You'd better lie down," said
49065. the countess.
49066. 
49067. "Lie down? All right, I will. I'll lie down at once," said Natasha.
49068. 
49069. When Natasha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously
49070. wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many
49071. questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And
49072. could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see
49073. him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger,
49074. she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving
49075. what they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would
49076. still be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner
49077. of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the
49078. countess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same
49079. way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving. She was
49080. planning something and either deciding or had already decided something
49081. in her mind. The countess knew this, but what it might be she did not
49082. know, and this alarmed and tormented her.
49083. 
49084. "Natasha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed."
49085. 
49086. A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss
49087. and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.
49088. 
49089. "No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor," Natasha replied
49090. irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open
49091. window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put
49092. her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck
49093. shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame. Natasha knew
49094. it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in
49095. the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage;
49096. but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged
49097. a look with Sonya.
49098. 
49099. "Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet," said the countess, softly
49100. touching Natasha's shoulders. "Come, lie down."
49101. 
49102. "Oh, yes... I'll lie down at once," said Natasha, and began hurriedly
49103. undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.
49104. 
49105. When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat
49106. down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the
49107. floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front,
49108. and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly
49109. unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved from side
49110. to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before
49111. her. When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the
49112. sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door.
49113. 
49114. "Natasha, you'd better lie in the middle," said Sonya.
49115. 
49116. "I'll stay here," muttered Natasha. "Do lie down," she added crossly,
49117. and buried her face in the pillow.
49118. 
49119. The countess, Madame Schoss, and Sonya undressed hastily and lay down.
49120. The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in
49121. the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little
49122. Mytishchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise
49123. of people shouting at a tavern Mamonov's Cossacks had set up across the
49124. street, and the adjutant's unceasing moans could still be heard.
49125. 
49126. For a long time Natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reached
49127. her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard
49128. her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under
49129. her, then Madame Schoss' familiar whistling snore and Sonya's gentle
49130. breathing. Then the countess called to Natasha. Natasha did not answer.
49131. 
49132. "I think she's asleep, Mamma," said Sonya softly.
49133. 
49134. After a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one
49135. replied.
49136. 
49137. Soon after that Natasha heard her mother's even breathing. Natasha did
49138. not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt,
49139. was growing cold on the bare floor.
49140. 
49141. As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a
49142. crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near
49143. by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the
49144. adjutant was heard. Natasha sat up.
49145. 
49146. "Sonya, are you asleep? Mamma?" she whispered.
49147. 
49148. No one replied. Natasha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and
49149. stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple,
49150. bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one
49151. foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and
49152. grasped the cold door handle.
49153. 
49154. It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against
49155. all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and
49156. terror and overflowing with love.
49157. 
49158. She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold,
49159. damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With
49160. her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened
49161. the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark
49162. in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which
49163. something was lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and
49164. smoldering wick.
49165. 
49166. From the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew's wound
49167. and his presence there, Natasha had resolved to see him. She did not
49168. know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the
49169. more convinced that it was necessary.
49170. 
49171. All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now
49172. that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might
49173. see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant
49174. moaning of the adjutant's? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her
49175. imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an
49176. indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the
49177. quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood
49178. still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She
49179. cautiously took one step and then another, and found herself in the
49180. middle of a small room containing baggage. Another man--Timokhin--was
49181. lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two others--the
49182. doctor and a valet--lay on the floor.
49183. 
49184. The valet sat up and whispered something. Timokhin, kept awake by the
49185. pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange
49186. apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap.
49187. The valet's sleepy, frightened exclamation, "What do you want? What's
49188. the matter?" made Natasha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the
49189. corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him.
49190. She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw
49191. Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she
49192. had always seen him.
49193. 
49194. He was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his
49195. glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck,
49196. delicate as a child's, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt,
49197. gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had never
49198. seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible,
49199. youthful movement dropped on her knees.
49200. 
49201. He smiled and held out his hand to her.
49202. 
49203. 
49204. 
49205. 
49206. 
49207. CHAPTER XXXII
49208. 
49209. 
49210. Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the
49211. ambulance station on the field of Borodino. His feverish state and the
49212. inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor's
49213. opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with
49214. pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his
49215. temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.
49216. The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had
49217. remained in the caleche, but at Mytishchi the wounded man himself asked
49218. to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into
49219. the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he
49220. had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with
49221. closed eyes. Then he opened them and whispered softly: "And the tea?"
49222. His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished
49223. the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew's pulse, and to his surprise and
49224. dissatisfaction found it had improved. He was dissatisfied because he
49225. knew by experience that if his patient did not die now, he would do so
49226. a little later with greater suffering. Timokhin, the red-nosed major of
49227. Prince Andrew's regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being
49228. taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of
49229. Borodino. They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrew's valet, his
49230. coachman, and two orderlies.
49231. 
49232. They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking with
49233. feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and
49234. remember something.
49235. 
49236. "I don't want any more. Is Timokhin here?" he asked.
49237. 
49238. Timokhin crept along the bench to him.
49239. 
49240. "I am here, your excellency."
49241. 
49242. "How's your wound?"
49243. 
49244. "Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?"
49245. 
49246. Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.
49247. 
49248. "Couldn't one get a book?" he asked.
49249. 
49250. "What book?"
49251. 
49252. "The Gospels. I haven't one."
49253. 
49254. The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he
49255. was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but
49256. reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was
49257. uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak
49258. with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of
49259. mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful
49260. place. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a
49261. change in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned
49262. again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking
49263. them to get him the book and put it under him.
49264. 
49265. "What trouble would it be to you?" he said. "I have not got one. Please
49266. get it for me and put it under for a moment," he pleaded in a piteous
49267. voice.
49268. 
49269. The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.
49270. 
49271. "You fellows have no conscience," said he to the valet who was pouring
49272. water over his hands. "For just one moment I didn't look after you...
49273. It's such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it."
49274. 
49275. "By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!"
49276. said the valet.
49277. 
49278. The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the
49279. matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked
49280. to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at Mytishchi.
49281. After growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he
49282. again regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once more recalled
49283. all that had happened to him, and above all vividly remembered the
49284. moment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of the sufferings of
49285. a man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to him which promised him
49286. happiness. And those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again
49287. possessed his soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of
49288. happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the Gospels.
49289. That was why he asked for a copy of them. The uncomfortable position in
49290. which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts,
49291. and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete
49292. stillness of the night. Everybody near him was sleeping. A cricket
49293. chirped from across the passage; someone was shouting and singing in
49294. the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on
49295. the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the
49296. candle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself
49297. like a mushroom.
49298. 
49299. His mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,
49300. feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the
49301. power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to
49302. fix his whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from the
49303. deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can
49304. then return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew's mind was not
49305. in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more
49306. active and clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most
49307. diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously. At times his
49308. brain suddenly began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had
49309. never reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the midst of its
49310. work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength
49311. to turn it back again.
49312. 
49313. "Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be
49314. deprived," he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut,
49315. gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. "A happiness
49316. lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act
49317. on man--a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every
49318. man can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible
49319. only for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?"
49320. 
49321. And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew
49322. heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a
49323. soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating
49324. "piti-piti-piti," and then "titi," and then again "piti-piti-piti," and
49325. "ti-ti" once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above
49326. the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out
49327. of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered music.
49328. He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was difficult) so
49329. that this airy structure should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept
49330. collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic
49331. music--"it stretches, stretches, spreading out and stretching," said
49332. Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to this whispering and feeling
49333. the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice
49334. of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and
49335. heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that
49336. flopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly touched his
49337. face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not
49338. destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of his
49339. face where it was rising. But besides this there was something else of
49340. importance. It was something white by the door--the statue of a sphinx,
49341. which also oppressed him.
49342. 
49343. "But perhaps that's my shirt on the table," he thought, "and that's my
49344. legs, and that is the door, but why is it always stretching and drawing
49345. itself out, and 'piti-piti-piti' and 'ti-ti' and 'piti-piti-piti'...?
49346. That's enough, please leave off!" Prince Andrew painfully entreated
49347. someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of
49348. his mind with peculiar clearness and force.
49349. 
49350. "Yes--love," he thought again quite clearly. "But not love which loves
49351. for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason,
49352. but the love which I--while dying--first experienced when I saw my enemy
49353. and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very
49354. essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel
49355. that bliss. To love one's neighbors, to love one's enemies, to love
49356. everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to
49357. love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved
49358. by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I
49359. loved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?...
49360. 
49361. "When loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but
49362. divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can
49363. destroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have
49364. I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did
49365. her." And he vividly pictured to himself Natasha, not as he had done in
49366. the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for
49367. the first time picturing to himself her soul. And he understood her
49368. feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the
49369. first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his
49370. rupture with her. "If only it were possible for me to see her once more!
49371. Just once, looking into those eyes to say..."
49372. 
49373. 
49374. "Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!" flopped the fly...
49375. And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a world of
49376. reality and delirium in which something particular was happening. In
49377. that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall,
49378. something was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo
49379. was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but
49380. besides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and
49381. a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door. And that sphinx had
49382. the pale face and shining eyes of the very Natasha of whom he had just
49383. been thinking.
49384. 
49385. "Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is," thought Prince Andrew,
49386. trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained
49387. before him with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew
49388. wished to return to that former world of pure thought, but he could not,
49389. and delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft whispering voice
49390. continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed him and stretched
49391. out, and the strange face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all
49392. his strength in an effort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and
49393. suddenly there was a ringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and
49394. like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness. When he came to
49395. himself, Natasha, that same living Natasha whom of all people he most
49396. longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to
49397. him, was kneeling before him. He realized that it was the real living
49398. Natasha, and he was not surprised but quietly happy. Natasha, motionless
49399. on her knees (she was unable to stir), with frightened eyes riveted on
49400. him, was restraining her sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the
49401. lower part of it something quivered.
49402. 
49403. Prince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.
49404. 
49405. "You?" he said. "How fortunate!"
49406. 
49407. With a rapid but careful movement Natasha drew nearer to him on her
49408. knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and began
49409. kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.
49410. 
49411. "Forgive me!" she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.
49412. "Forgive me!"
49413. 
49414. "I love you," said Prince Andrew.
49415. 
49416. "Forgive...!"
49417. 
49418. "Forgive what?" he asked.
49419. 
49420. "Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!" faltered Natasha in a scarcely
49421. audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just
49422. touching it with her lips.
49423. 
49424. "I love you more, better than before," said Prince Andrew, lifting her
49425. face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.
49426. 
49427. Those eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,
49428. compassionately, and with joyous love. Natasha's thin pale face, with
49429. its swollen lips, was more than plain--it was dreadful. But Prince
49430. Andrew did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful.
49431. They heard the sound of voices behind them.
49432. 
49433. Peter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor.
49434. Timokhin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had
49435. long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare
49436. body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.
49437. 
49438. "What's this?" said the doctor, rising from his bed. "Please go away,
49439. madam!"
49440. 
49441. At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her
49442. daughter's absence, knocked at the door.
49443. 
49444. Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natasha went out of the room
49445. and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.
49446. 
49447. 
49448. From that time, during all the rest of the Rostovs' journey, at every
49449. halting place and wherever they spent a night, Natasha never left the
49450. wounded Bolkonski, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected
49451. from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a
49452. wounded man.
49453. 
49454. Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew
49455. die in her daughter's arms during the journey--as, judging by what
49456. the doctor said, it seemed might easily happen--she could not oppose
49457. Natasha. Though with the intimacy now established between the wounded
49458. man and Natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former
49459. engagement would be renewed, no one--least of all Natasha and Prince
49460. Andrew--spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and death, which
49461. hung not only over Bolkonski but over all Russia, shut out all other
49462. considerations.
49463. 
49464. 
49465. 
49466. 
49467. 
49468. CHAPTER XXXIII
49469. 
49470. 
49471. On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the
49472. clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on
49473. his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful
49474. he had done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterday's
49475. conversation with Captain Ramballe.
49476. 
49477. It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors.
49478. Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved
49479. stock which Gerasim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered
49480. where he was and what lay before him that very day.
49481. 
49482. "Am I not too late?" he thought. "No, probably he won't make his entry
49483. into Moscow before noon."
49484. 
49485. Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but
49486. hastened to act.
49487. 
49488. After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out.
49489. But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could
49490. not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets. It was difficult
49491. to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat. He could not
49492. carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had been
49493. discharged, and he had not had time to reload it. "No matter, dagger
49494. will do," he said to himself, though when planning his design he had
49495. more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the
49496. student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as
49497. his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving
49498. to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he
49499. could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a
49500. green sheath which he had bought at the Sukharev market with the pistol,
49501. and hid it under his waistcoat.
49502. 
49503. Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head,
49504. Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting
49505. the captain, and passed out into the street.
49506. 
49507. The conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the
49508. evening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on
49509. fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river,
49510. in the Bazaar and the Povarskoy, as well as the barges on the Moskva
49511. River and the timber yards by the Dorogomilov Bridge, were all ablaze.
49512. 
49513. Pierre's way led through side streets to the Povarskoy and from there
49514. to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbat, where he had long before
49515. decided that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses
49516. were locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted.
49517. The air was full of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he met
49518. Russians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of
49519. the city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both
49520. the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his
49521. height and stoutness, and the strange morose look of suffering in his
49522. face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre because they could
49523. not make out to what class he could belong. The French followed him with
49524. astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the
49525. other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid no
49526. attention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, who were
49527. explaining something to some Russians who did not understand them,
49528. stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French.
49529. 
49530. Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel
49531. standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout
49532. was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man's musket as
49533. he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side
49534. of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around
49535. him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like
49536. something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night's
49537. experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring
49538. his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by
49539. anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out,
49540. for Napoleon had passed the Arbat more than four hours previously on his
49541. way from the Dorogomilov suburb to the Kremlin, and was now sitting in
49542. a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Kremlin, giving
49543. detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately
49544. to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the
49545. inhabitants. But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed
49546. in what lay before him, and was tortured--as those are who obstinately
49547. undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its
49548. difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures--by the
49549. fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.
49550. 
49551. Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct
49552. and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarskoy.
49553. 
49554. As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser--he
49555. even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose
49556. from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets
49557. and they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that something
49558. unusual was happening around him, did not realize that he was
49559. approaching the fire. As he was going along a foot path across a
49560. wide-open space adjoining the Povarskoy on one side and the gardens
49561. of Prince Gruzinski's house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the
49562. desperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening
49563. from a dream and lifted his head.
49564. 
49565. By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household
49566. goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the
49567. ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long,
49568. prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman,
49569. swaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs. Two
49570. girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks,
49571. were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale
49572. frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an
49573. overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his
49574. old nurse's arms. A dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk,
49575. and, having undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling it straight
49576. and sniffing at her singed hair. The woman's husband, a short,
49577. round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official, with
49578. sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair
49579. smoothly brushed forward over his temples, with expressionless face was
49580. moving the trunks, which were placed one on another, and was dragging
49581. some garments from under them.
49582. 
49583. As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.
49584. 
49585. "Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends... help
49586. us, somebody," she muttered between her sobs. "My girl... My daughter!
49587. My youngest daughter is left behind. She's burned! Ooh! Was it for this
49588. I nursed you.... Ooh!"
49589. 
49590. "Don't, Mary Nikolievna!" said her husband to her in a low voice,
49591. evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. "Sister must have
49592. taken her, or else where can she be?" he added.
49593. 
49594. "Monster! Villain!" shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep.
49595. "You have no heart, you don't feel for your own child! Another man would
49596. have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a
49597. man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man," she went on,
49598. addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. "The fire broke out
49599. alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out 'Fire!' and we rushed
49600. to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we
49601. have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost.
49602. We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!..." and again she
49603. began to sob. "My child, my dear one! Burned, burned!"
49604. 
49605. "But where was she left?" asked Pierre.
49606. 
49607. From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man
49608. might help her.
49609. 
49610. "Oh, dear sir!" she cried, seizing him by the legs. "My benefactor, set
49611. my heart at ease.... Aniska, go, you horrid girl, show him the way!" she
49612. cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing
49613. her long teeth.
49614. 
49615. "Show me the way, show me, I... I'll do it," gasped Pierre rapidly.
49616. 
49617. The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait,
49618. sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt
49619. as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his head
49620. higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift steps
49621. he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the Povarskoy. The
49622. whole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here
49623. and there broke through that cloud. A great number of people crowded in
49624. front of the conflagration. In the middle of the street stood a French
49625. general saying something to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by the
49626. maid, was advancing to the spot where the general stood, but the French
49627. soldiers stopped him.
49628. 
49629. "On ne passe pas!" * cried a voice.
49630. 
49631. 
49632.     * "You can't pass!"
49633. 
49634. 
49635. "This way, uncle," cried the girl. "We'll pass through the side street,
49636. by the Nikulins'!"
49637. 
49638. Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her.
49639. She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and,
49640. passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.
49641. 
49642. "It's here, close by," said she and, running across the yard, opened a
49643. gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden
49644. wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One of its
49645. sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from
49646. the openings of the windows and from under the roof.
49647. 
49648. As Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air and
49649. involuntarily stopped.
49650. 
49651. "Which is it? Which is your house?" he asked.
49652. 
49653. "Ooh!" wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. "That's it, that was our
49654. lodging. You've burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little
49655. missy! Ooh!" lamented Aniska, who at the sight of the fire felt that she
49656. too must give expression to her feelings.
49657. 
49658. Pierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he
49659. involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house
49660. that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and around
49661. which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize
49662. what these men, who were dragging something out, were about; but seeing
49663. before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying
49664. to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that looting was
49665. going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.
49666. 
49667. The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the
49668. whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and
49669. the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds
49670. and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense
49671. sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along
49672. the walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced
49673. on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a
49674. peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt
49675. himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt
49676. young, bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of
49677. the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still
49678. standing, when just above his head he heard several voices shouting
49679. and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close
49680. beside him.
49681. 
49682. Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen
49683. who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal
49684. articles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.
49685. 
49686. "What does this fellow want?" shouted one of them referring to Pierre.
49687. 
49688. "There's a child in that house. Haven't you seen a child?" cried Pierre.
49689. 
49690. "What's he talking about? Get along!" said several voices, and one of
49691. the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from
49692. them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved
49693. threateningly toward him.
49694. 
49695. "A child?" shouted a Frenchman from above. "I did hear something
49696. squealing in the garden. Perhaps it's his brat that the fellow is
49697. looking for. After all, one must be human, you know...."
49698. 
49699. "Where is it? Where?" said Pierre.
49700. 
49701. "There! There!" shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the
49702. garden at the back of the house. "Wait a bit--I'm coming down."
49703. 
49704. And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot
49705. on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the
49706. ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the
49707. garden.
49708. 
49709. "Hurry up, you others!" he called out to his comrades. "It's getting
49710. hot."
49711. 
49712. When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled
49713. Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a
49714. three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.
49715. 
49716. "There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!" said the
49717. Frenchman. "Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you
49718. know!" and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his
49719. comrades.
49720. 
49721. Breathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take
49722. her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking
49723. child, unattractively like her mother, began to yell and run away.
49724. Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his arms. She screamed
49725. desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre's
49726. hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized
49727. by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when
49728. touching some nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to throw
49729. the child down and ran with her to the large house. It was now, however,
49730. impossible to get back the way he had come; the maid, Aniska, was no
49731. longer there, and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the
49732. wet, painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran
49733. with her through the garden seeking another way out.
49734. 
49735. 
49736. 
49737. 
49738. 
49739. CHAPTER XXXIV
49740. 
49741. 
49742. Having run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back
49743. with his little burden to the Gruzinski garden at the corner of the
49744. Povarskoy. He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set
49745. out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and goods
49746. that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian families who
49747. had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings, there were
49748. several French soldiers in a variety of clothing. Pierre took no notice
49749. of them. He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to
49750. restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre
49751. felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the
49752. heat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever
49753. the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had come on him
49754. when he ran to save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging
49755. with her little hands to Pierre's coat, sat on his arm gazing about
49756. her like some little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a
49757. slight smile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that
49758. frightened, sickly little face.
49759. 
49760. He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them. He
49761. walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various faces he
49762. met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family
49763. consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new,
49764. cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar
49765. type, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the
49766. perfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched,
49767. black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long,
49768. beautiful, expressionless face. Amid the scattered property and the
49769. crowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright
49770. lilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out
49771. onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old
49772. woman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless, large,
49773. almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she was aware
49774. of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre and,
49775. hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to look at her.
49776. When he had reached the fence, still without finding those he sought, he
49777. stopped and looked about him.
49778. 
49779. With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than
49780. before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.
49781. 
49782. "Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You're of the gentry yourself,
49783. aren't you? Whose child is it?" they asked him.
49784. 
49785. Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who
49786. had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether
49787. anyone knew where she had gone.
49788. 
49789. "Why, that must be the Anferovs," said an old deacon, addressing a
49790. pockmarked peasant woman. "Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!" he added
49791. in his customary bass.
49792. 
49793. "The Anferovs? No," said the woman. "They left in the morning. That must
49794. be either Mary Nikolievna's or the Ivanovs'!"
49795. 
49796. "He says 'a woman,' and Mary Nikolievna is a lady," remarked a house
49797. serf.
49798. 
49799. "Do you know her? She's thin, with long teeth," said Pierre.
49800. 
49801. "That's Mary Nikolievna! They went inside the garden when these wolves
49802. swooped down," said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.
49803. 
49804. "O Lord, have mercy!" added the deacon.
49805. 
49806. "Go over that way, they're there. It's she! She kept on lamenting and
49807. crying," continued the woman. "It's she. Here, this way!"
49808. 
49809. But Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds been
49810. intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was looking at
49811. the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them.
49812. One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round
49813. the waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were
49814. bare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a
49815. long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements
49816. and with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a woman's loose gown
49817. of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian boots. The little
49818. barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and,
49819. saying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old
49820. man at once began pulling off his boots. The other in the frieze gown
49821. stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in
49822. his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.
49823. 
49824. "Here, take the child!" said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the
49825. woman, handing the little girl to her. "Give her back to them, give her
49826. back!" he almost shouted, putting the child, who began screaming, on the
49827. ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.
49828. 
49829. The old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had
49830. secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other.
49831. The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre
49832. caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the
49833. Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to
49834. side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his
49835. pockets had seized her by the neck.
49836. 
49837. The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude,
49838. with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the
49839. soldier was doing to her.
49840. 
49841. While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the
49842. Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing
49843. from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the young
49844. woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.
49845. 
49846. "Let that woman alone!" exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice,
49847. seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside.
49848. 
49849. The soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing down
49850. the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.
49851. 
49852. "Voyons, Pas de betises!" * he cried.
49853. 
49854. 
49855.     * "Look here, no nonsense!"
49856. 
49857. 
49858. Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and
49859. his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman
49860. and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his
49861. feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard
49862. from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French
49863. Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to
49864. Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing
49865. of what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and
49866. being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a
49867. crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him.
49868. 
49869. "Lieutenant, he has a dagger," were the first words Pierre understood.
49870. 
49871. "Ah, a weapon?" said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier
49872. who had been arrested with Pierre. "All right, you can tell all about it
49873. at the court-martial." Then he turned to Pierre. "Do you speak French?"
49874. 
49875. Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His
49876. face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in
49877. a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on
49878. both sides of Pierre.
49879. 
49880. "Do you speak French?" the officer asked again, keeping at a distance
49881. from Pierre. "Call the interpreter."
49882. 
49883. A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and
49884. by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a
49885. French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.
49886. 
49887. "He does not look like a common man," said the interpreter, after a
49888. searching look at Pierre.
49889. 
49890. "Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary," remarked the officer. "And
49891. ask him who he is," he added.
49892. 
49893. "Who are you?" asked the interpreter in poor Russian. "You must answer
49894. the chief."
49895. 
49896. "I will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner--take me!" Pierre
49897. suddenly replied in French.
49898. 
49899. "Ah, ah!" muttered the officer with a frown. "Well then, march!"
49900. 
49901. A crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the
49902. pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol
49903. started she moved forward.
49904. 
49905. "Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?" said she. "And the little
49906. girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she's not theirs?"
49907. said the woman.
49908. 
49909. "What does that woman want?" asked the officer.
49910. 
49911. Pierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight of the
49912. little girl he had saved.
49913. 
49914. "What does she want?" he murmured. "She is bringing me my daughter whom
49915. I have just saved from the flames," said he. "Good-by!" And without
49916. knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along with
49917. resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.
49918. 
49919. The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various
49920. streets of Moscow by Durosnel's order to put a stop to the pillage,
49921. and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general
49922. opinion which had that day originated among the higher French officers,
49923. were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through a number
49924. of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects: a small
49925. shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house serf, besides
49926. several looters. But of all these various suspected characters, Pierre
49927. was considered to be the most suspicious of all. When they had all been
49928. brought for the night to a large house on the Zubov Rampart that was
49929. being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed apart under strict guard.

49941. CHAPTER I
49942. 
49943. 
49944. In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on
49945. with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between the parties
49946. of Rumyantsev, the French, Marya Fedorovna, the Tsarevich, and others,
49947. drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But the calm,
49948. luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about phantoms and
49949. reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made it hard,
49950. except by a great effort, to realize the danger and the difficult
49951. position of the Russian people. There were the same receptions and
49952. balls, the same French theater, the same court interests and service
49953. interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the very highest circles were
49954. attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position.
49955. Stories were whispered of how differently the two Empresses behaved
49956. in these difficult circumstances. The Empress Marya, concerned for
49957. the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her
49958. patronage, had given directions that they should all be removed to
49959. Kazan, and the things belonging to these institutions had already been
49960. packed up. The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions
49961. she would be pleased to give--with her characteristic Russian patriotism
49962. had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions
49963. for that was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally
49964. was concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.
49965. 
49966. At Anna Pavlovna's on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of the
49967. battle of Borodino, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which was
49968. to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending
49969. the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was regarded as a model
49970. of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince Vasili himself, famed for
49971. his elocution, was to read it. (He used to read at the Empress'.) The
49972. art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite
49973. independently of their meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating
49974. between a despairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell
49975. quite at random on one word and the murmur on another. This reading,
49976. as was always the case at Anna Pavlovna's soirees, had a political
49977. significance. That evening she expected several important personages who
49978. had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused
49979. to a patriotic temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna
49980. Pavlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room,
49981. did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general
49982. conversation.
49983. 
49984. The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bezukhova.
49985. She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed
49986. several gatherings of which she was usually ornament, and was said to be
49987. receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors who
49988. usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor who
49989. was treating her in some new and unusual way.
49990. 
49991. They all knew very well that the enchanting countess' illness arose from
49992. an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time,
49993. and that the Italian's cure consisted in removing such inconvenience;
49994. but in Anna Pavlovna's presence no one dared to think of this or even
49995. appear to know it.
49996. 
49997. "They say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina
49998. pectoris."
49999. 
50000. "Angina? Oh, that's a terrible illness!"
50001. 
50002. "They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina..." and
50003. the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.
50004. 
50005. "The count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor
50006. told him the case was dangerous."
50007. 
50008. "Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman."
50009. 
50010. "You are speaking of the poor countess?" said Anna Pavlovna, coming
50011. up just then. "I sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little
50012. better. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the world," she
50013. went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. "We belong to different
50014. camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She
50015. is very unfortunate!" added Anna Pavlovna.
50016. 
50017. Supposing that by these words Anna Pavlovna was somewhat lifting the
50018. veil from the secret of the countess' malady, an unwary young man
50019. ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been called
50020. in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might
50021. employ dangerous remedies.
50022. 
50023. "Your information maybe better than mine," Anna Pavlovna suddenly and
50024. venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, "but I know on good
50025. authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He is private
50026. physician to the Queen of Spain."
50027. 
50028. And having thus demolished the young man, Anna Pavlovna turned to
50029. another group where Bilibin was talking about the Austrians: having
50030. wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again
50031. and utter one of his mots.
50032. 
50033. "I think it is delightful," he said, referring to a diplomatic note that
50034. had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the
50035. French by Wittgenstein, "the hero of Petropol" as he was then called in
50036. Petersburg.
50037. 
50038. "What? What's that?" asked Anna Pavlovna, securing silence for the mot,
50039. which she had heard before.
50040. 
50041. And Bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch, which
50042. he had himself composed.
50043. 
50044. "The Emperor returns these Austrian banners," said Bilibin, "friendly
50045. banners gone astray and found on a wrong path," and his brow became
50046. smooth again.
50047. 
50048. "Charming, charming!" observed Prince Vasili.
50049. 
50050. "The path to Warsaw, perhaps," Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and
50051. unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant.
50052. Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise. He knew no
50053. more than the others what his words meant. During his diplomatic career
50054. he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very
50055. witty, and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words
50056. that entered his head. "It may turn out very well," he thought, "but
50057. if not, they'll know how to arrange matters." And really, during the
50058. awkward silence that ensued, that insufficiently patriotic person
50059. entered whom Anna Pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert,
50060. and she, smiling and shaking a finger at Hippolyte, invited Prince
50061. Vasili to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript
50062. begged him to begin. Everyone became silent.
50063. 
50064. 
50065. "Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!" Prince Vasili sternly declaimed,
50066. looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had
50067. anything to say to the contrary. But no one said anything. "Moscow, our
50068. ancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives her Christ"--he placed a
50069. sudden emphasis on the word her--"as a mother receives her zealous sons
50070. into her arms, and through the gathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant
50071. glory of thy rule, sings in exultation, 'Hosanna, blessed is he that
50072. cometh!'"
50073. 
50074. 
50075. Prince Vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.
50076. 
50077. Bilibin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present
50078. appeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna
50079. Pavlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman
50080. muttering the prayer at Communion: "Let the bold and insolent
50081. Goliath..." she whispered.
50082. 
50083. Prince Vasili continued.
50084. 
50085. 
50086. "Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass
50087. the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the sling
50088. of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty
50089. pride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and
50090. zealous champion of old of our country's weal, is offered to Your
50091. Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing
50092. in the sight of your most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to
50093. Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully
50094. fulfill the desires of Your Majesty."
50095. 
50096. 
50097. "What force! What a style!" was uttered in approval both of reader and
50098. of author.
50099. 
50100. Animated by that address Anna Pavlovna's guests talked for a long time
50101. of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the
50102. result of the battle to be fought in a few days.
50103. 
50104. "You will see," said Anna Pavlovna, "that tomorrow, on the Emperor's
50105. birthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!"
50106. 
50107. 
50108. 
50109. 
50110. 
50111. CHAPTER II
50112. 
50113. 
50114. Anna Pavlovna's presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day during the
50115. service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor's birthday, Prince
50116. Volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from
50117. Prince Kutuzov. It was Kutuzov's report, written from Tatarinova on the
50118. day of the battle. Kutuzov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a
50119. step, that the French losses were much heavier than ours, and that he
50120. was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full
50121. information. It followed that there must have been a victory. And at
50122. once, without leaving the church, thanks were rendered to the Creator
50123. for His help and for the victory.
50124. 
50125. Anna Pavlovna's presentiment was justified, and all that morning a
50126. joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the victory
50127. to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon's having been
50128. captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for
50129. France.
50130. 
50131. It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength
50132. and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the
50133. scene of action. General events involuntarily group themselves around
50134. some particular incident. So now the courtiers' pleasure was based as
50135. much on the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperor's birthday as
50136. on the fact of the victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged
50137. surprise. Mention was made in Kutuzov's report of the Russian losses,
50138. among which figured the names of Tuchkov, Bagration, and Kutaysov. In
50139. the Petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily
50140. centered round a single incident: Kutaysov's death. Everybody knew
50141. him, the Emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting. That day
50142. everyone met with the words:
50143. 
50144. "What a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a loss
50145. Kutaysov is! How sorry I am!"
50146. 
50147. "What did I tell about Kutuzov?" Prince Vasili now said with a
50148. prophet's pride. "I always said he was the only man capable of defeating
50149. Napoleon."
50150. 
50151. But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew
50152. anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense
50153. occasioned the Emperor.
50154. 
50155. "Fancy the Emperor's position!" said they, and instead of extolling
50156. Kutuzov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause
50157. of the Emperor's anxiety. That day Prince Vasili no longer boasted of
50158. his protege Kutuzov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was
50159. mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make
50160. Petersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was
50161. added. Countess Helene Bezukhova had suddenly died of that terrible
50162. malady it had been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large
50163. gatherings, everyone said that Countess Bezukhova had died of a
50164. terrible attack of angina pectoris, but in intimate circles details
50165. were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had
50166. prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect;
50167. but Helene, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and
50168. that her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate
50169. Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of the
50170. drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her.
50171. It was said that Prince Vasili and the old count had turned upon the
50172. Italian, but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate
50173. deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop.
50174. 
50175. Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor's
50176. lack of news, the loss of Kutuzov, and the death of Helene.
50177. 
50178. On the third day after Kutuzov's report a country gentleman arrived from
50179. Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through
50180. the whole town. This was terrible! What a position for the Emperor to
50181. be in! Kutuzov was a traitor, and Prince Vasili during the visits of
50182. condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter's death said of
50183. Kutuzov, whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his
50184. grief to forget what he had said), that it was impossible to expect
50185. anything else from a blind and depraved old man.
50186. 
50187. "I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such
50188. a man."
50189. 
50190. As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it,
50191. but the next day the following communication was received from Count
50192. Rostopchin:
50193. 
50194. 
50195. Prince Kutuzov's adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands
50196. police officers to guide the army to the Ryazan road. He writes that
50197. he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kutuzov's action decides the
50198. fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will shudder to learn of
50199. the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in
50200. which lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall follow the army. I have
50201. had everything removed, and it only remains for me to weep over the fate
50202. of my fatherland.
50203. 
50204. 
50205. On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkonski to Kutuzov
50206. with the following rescript:
50207. 
50208. 
50209. Prince Michael Ilarionovich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have
50210. received no communication from you, yet on the first of September I
50211. received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via Yaroslavl, the sad
50212. news that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You can
50213. yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your silence
50214. increases my astonishment. I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince
50215. Volkonski, to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons
50216. that have induced you to take this melancholy decision.
50217. 
50218. 
50219. 
50220. 
50221. 
50222. CHAPTER III
50223. 
50224. 
50225. Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from Kutuzov
50226. reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event. This
50227. messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know Russian, but who was
50228. quoique etranger, russe de coeur et d'ame, * as he said of himself.
50229. 
50230. 
50231.     * Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.
50232. 
50233. 
50234. The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace
50235. on Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before the campaign
50236. and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as he wrote) when
50237. he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain * with the news of the
50238. burning of Moscow, dont les flammes eclairaient sa route. *(2)
50239. 
50240. 
50241.      * Our most gracious sovereign.
50242. 
50243.      * (2) Whose flames illumined his route.
50244. 
50245. 
50246. Though the source of M. Michaud's chagrin must have been different from
50247. that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when shown
50248. into the Emperor's study that the latter at once asked:
50249. 
50250. "Have you brought me sad news, Colonel?"
50251. 
50252. "Very sad, sire," replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh. "The
50253. abandonment of Moscow."
50254. 
50255. "Have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?" asked the
50256. Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.
50257. 
50258. Michaud respectfully delivered the message Kutuzov had entrusted to him,
50259. which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and that
50260. as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as
50261. Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the
50262. latter.
50263. 
50264. The Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.
50265. 
50266. "Has the enemy entered the city?" he asked.
50267. 
50268. "Yes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,"
50269. replied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he was
50270. frightened by what he had done.
50271. 
50272. The Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip
50273. trembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.
50274. 
50275. But this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming
50276. himself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in a
50277. firm voice:
50278. 
50279. "I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence requires
50280. great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in all things to
50281. His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the army when it
50282. saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did you not notice
50283. discouragement?..."
50284. 
50285. Seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also
50286. grew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor's
50287. direct and relevant question which required a direct answer.
50288. 
50289. "Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?" he
50290. asked to gain time.
50291. 
50292. "Colonel, I always require it," replied the Emperor. "Conceal nothing
50293. from me, I wish to know absolutely how things are."
50294. 
50295. "Sire!" said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on his
50296. lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, "sire, I left the
50297. whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without exception in
50298. desperate and agonized terror..."
50299. 
50300. "How is that?" the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. "Would
50301. misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!"
50302. 
50303. Michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had
50304. prepared.
50305. 
50306. "Sire," he said, with respectful playfulness, "they are only afraid lest
50307. Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourself to be
50308. persuaded to make peace. They are burning for the combat," declared this
50309. representative of the Russian nation, "and to prove to Your Majesty by
50310. the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are...."
50311. 
50312. "Ah!" said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his eyes,
50313. he patted Michaud on the shoulder. "You set me at ease, Colonel."
50314. 
50315. He bent his head and was silent for some time.
50316. 
50317. "Well, then, go back to the army," he said, drawing himself up to his
50318. full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture,
50319. "and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that
50320. when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my
50321. beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of
50322. my empire. It still offers me more than my enemies suppose," said the
50323. Emperor growing more and more animated; "but should it ever be ordained
50324. by Divine Providence," he continued, raising to heaven his fine eyes
50325. shining with emotion, "that my dynasty should cease to reign on the
50326. throne of my ancestors, then after exhausting all the means at my
50327. command, I shall let my beard grow to here" (he pointed halfway down his
50328. chest) "and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants, rather
50329. than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose
50330. sacrifices I know how to appreciate."
50331. 
50332. Having uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly
50333. turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes,
50334. and went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a few
50335. moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow
50336. with a vigorous movement. The Emperor's mild and handsome face was
50337. flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.
50338. 
50339. "Colonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we may
50340. recall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I," said the Emperor,
50341. touching his breast. "We can no longer both reign together. I have
50342. learned to know him, and he will not deceive me any more...."
50343. 
50344. And the Emperor paused, with a frown.
50345. 
50346. When he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution
50347. in the Emperor's eyes, Michaud--quoique etranger, russe de coeur et
50348. d'ame--at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had
50349. heard (as he used afterwards to say), and gave expression to his
50350. own feelings and those of the Russian people whose representative he
50351. considered himself to be, in the following words:
50352. 
50353. "Sire!" said he, "Your Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of
50354. the nation and the salvation of Europe!"
50355. 
50356. With an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him.
50357. 
50358. 
50359. 
50360. 
50361. 
50362. CHAPTER IV
50363. 
50364. 
50365. It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that
50366. when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to
50367. distant provinces, and one levy after another was being raised for the
50368. defense of the fatherland, all Russians from the greatest to the least
50369. were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves, saving their fatherland,
50370. or weeping over its downfall. The tales and descriptions of that time
50371. without exception speak only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion,
50372. despair, grief, and the heroism of the Russians. But it was not really
50373. so. It appears so to us because we see only the general historic
50374. interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests
50375. that people had. Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment
50376. so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the
50377. public interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the people at
50378. that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were
50379. guided only by their private interests, and they were the very people
50380. whose activities at that period were most useful.
50381. 
50382. Those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take
50383. part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members
50384. of society, they saw everything upside down, and all they did for the
50385. common good turned out to be useless and foolish--like Pierre's and
50386. Mamonov's regiments which looted Russian villages, and the lint the
50387. young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded, and so on.
50388. Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings,
50389. who discussed Russia's position at the time involuntarily introduced
50390. into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or
50391. useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of
50392. actions no one could possibly be guilty of. In historic events the rule
50393. forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is specially
50394. applicable. Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part
50395. in an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries to
50396. realize it his efforts are fruitless.
50397. 
50398. The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in
50399. Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg and
50400. in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in
50401. militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of
50402. self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow
50403. there was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight
50404. of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they
50405. thought about their next pay, their next quarters, of Matreshka the
50406. vivandiere, and like matters.
50407. 
50408. As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rostov took a close
50409. and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually,
50410. without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was
50411. going on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his
50412. brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the state of
50413. Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to think about
50414. it, that Kutuzov and others were there for that purpose, but that he had
50415. heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength, that
50416. fighting would probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being
50417. so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple
50418. of years' time.
50419. 
50420. As he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being
50421. sent to Voronezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without
50422. regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but
50423. with the greatest pleasure--which he did not conceal and which his
50424. comrades fully understood.
50425. 
50426. A few days before the battle of Borodino, Nicholas received the
50427. necessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in
50428. advance, he set out with post horses for Voronezh.
50429. 
50430. Only a man who has experienced it--that is, has passed some months
50431. continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war--can understand
50432. the delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the
50433. army's foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals. When--free
50434. from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a camp--he saw villages
50435. with peasants and peasant women, gentlemen's country houses, fields
50436. where cattle were grazing, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in
50437. them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time. What for
50438. a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women, young
50439. and healthy, without a dozen officers making up to each of them; women,
50440. too, who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke
50441. with them.
50442. 
50443. In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in Voronezh,
50444. ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and next day, very
50445. clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long
50446. time, went to present himself to the authorities.
50447. 
50448. The commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man who was
50449. evidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He received
50450. Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military)
50451. and questioned him with an important air, as if considering the general
50452. progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do
50453. so. Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him.
50454. 
50455. From the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The governor
50456. was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated the stud
50457. farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended to him a horse
50458. dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had
50459. the best horses, and promised to assist him in every way.
50460. 
50461. "You are Count Ilya Rostov's son? My wife was a great friend of your
50462. mother's. We are at home on Thursdays--today is Thursday, so please come
50463. and see us quite informally," said the governor, taking leave of him.
50464. 
50465. Immediately on leaving the governor's, Nicholas hired post horses and,
50466. taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop to the
50467. landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything seemed to
50468. him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Voronezh
50469. and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind,
50470. everything went well and easily.
50471. 
50472. The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a
50473. horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy
50474. and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who
50475. owned some splendid horses.
50476. 
50477. In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six
50478. thousand rubles--to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts.
50479. After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine,
50480. Nicholas--having exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was
50481. already on the friendliest terms--galloped back over abominable roads,
50482. in the brightest frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as
50483. to be in time for the governor's party.
50484. 
50485. When he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented himself,
50486. Nicholas arrived at the governor's rather late, but with the phrase
50487. "better late than never" on his lips.
50488. 
50489. It was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew
50490. that Catherine Petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the
50491. clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come as
50492. to a ball.
50493. 
50494. Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this
50495. difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the
50496. arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything that
50497. went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an
50498. "in for a penny, in for a pound--who cares?" spirit, and the inevitable
50499. small talk, instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances,
50500. now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.
50501. 
50502. The society gathered together at the governor's was the best in
50503. Voronezh.
50504. 
50505. There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas' Moscow
50506. acquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the
50507. cavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured
50508. and well-bred Count Rostov. Among the men was an Italian prisoner, an
50509. officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that
50510. prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The Italian
50511. was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him
50512. that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he treated him
50513. cordially though with dignity and restraint.
50514. 
50515. As soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him
50516. a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the words "better late
50517. than never" and heard them repeated several times by others, people
50518. clustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he felt at once that
50519. he had entered into his proper position in the province--that of a
50520. universal favorite: a very pleasant position, and intoxicatingly so
50521. after his long privations. At posting stations, at inns, and in the
50522. landowner's snuggery, maidservants had been flattered by his notice, and
50523. here too at the governor's party there were (as it seemed to Nicholas)
50524. an inexhaustible number of pretty young women, married and unmarried,
50525. impatiently awaiting his notice. The women and girls flirted with him
50526. and, from the first day, the people concerned themselves to get this
50527. fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these
50528. was the governor's wife herself, who welcomed Rostov as a near relative
50529. and called him "Nicholas."
50530. 
50531. Catherine Petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise, and
50532. dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial
50533. society by his agility. His particularly free manner of dancing even
50534. surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he
50535. danced that evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would
50536. even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in
50537. bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by
50538. something unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular
50539. thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces.
50540. 
50541. All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and
50542. pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.
50543. With the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men's
50544. wives were created for them, Rostov did not leave the lady's side and
50545. treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style, as if,
50546. without speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady
50547. would get on together. The husband, however, did not seem to share that
50548. conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rostov. But the
50549. latter's good-natured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even he
50550. involuntarily yielded to Nicholas' good humor. Toward the end of the
50551. evening, however, as the wife's face grew more flushed and animated, the
50552. husband's became more and more melancholy and solemn, as though there
50553. were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife's
50554. share increased the husband's diminished.
50555. 
50556. 
50557. 
50558. 
50559. 
50560. CHAPTER V
50561. 
50562. 
50563. Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending closely
50564. over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a
50565. smile that never left his face. Jauntily shifting the position of his
50566. legs in their tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, and
50567. admiring his partner, himself, and the fine outlines of his legs in
50568. their well-fitting Hessian boots, Nicholas told the blonde lady that he
50569. wished to run away with a certain lady here in Voronezh.
50570. 
50571. "Which lady?"
50572. 
50573. "A charming lady, a divine one. Her eyes" (Nicholas looked at his
50574. partner) "are blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figure" (he glanced
50575. at her shoulders) "like Diana's...."
50576. 
50577. The husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking
50578. about.
50579. 
50580. "Ah, Nikita Ivanych!" cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if wishing
50581. Nikita Ivanych to share his joke, he began to tell him of his intention
50582. to elope with a blonde lady.
50583. 
50584. The husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governor's good-natured
50585. wife came up with a look of disapproval.
50586. 
50587. "Anna Ignatyevna wants to see you, Nicholas," said she, pronouncing the
50588. name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna Ignatyevna was a very
50589. important person. "Come, Nicholas! You know you let me call you so?"
50590. 
50591. "Oh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?"
50592. 
50593. "Anna Ignatyevna Malvintseva. She has heard from her niece how you
50594. rescued her... Can you guess?"
50595. 
50596. "I rescued such a lot of them!" said Nicholas.
50597. 
50598. "Her niece, Princess Bolkonskaya. She is here in Voronezh with her aunt.
50599. Oho! How you blush. Why, are...?"
50600. 
50601. "Not a bit! Please don't, Aunt!"
50602. 
50603. "Very well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!"
50604. 
50605. The governor's wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with
50606. a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most
50607. important personages of the town. This was Malvintseva, Princess Mary's
50608. aunt on her mother's side, a rich, childless widow who always lived in
50609. Voronezh. When Rostov approached her she was standing settling up for
50610. the game. She looked at him and, screwing up her eyes sternly, continued
50611. to upbraid the general who had won from her.
50612. 
50613. "Very pleased, mon cher," she then said, holding out her hand to
50614. Nicholas. "Pray come and see me."
50615. 
50616. After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom
50617. Malvintseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas
50618. knew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the
50619. important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to
50620. come to see her.
50621. 
50622. Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the mention
50623. of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear,
50624. which he himself did not understand.
50625. 
50626. When he had parted from Malvintseva Nicholas wished to return to the
50627. dancing, but the governor's little wife placed her plump hand on his
50628. sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to
50629. her sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew
50630. so as not to be in her way.
50631. 
50632. "Do you know, dear boy," began the governor's wife with a serious
50633. expression on her kind little face, "that really would be the match for
50634. you: would you like me to arrange it?"
50635. 
50636. "Whom do you mean, Aunt?" asked Nicholas.
50637. 
50638. "I will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine Petrovna
50639. speaks of Lily, but I say, no--the princess! Do you want me to do it? I
50640. am sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl she is,
50641. really! And she is not at all so plain, either."
50642. 
50643. "Not at all," replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. "As befits
50644. a soldier, Aunt, I don't force myself on anyone or refuse anything," he
50645. said before he had time to consider what he was saying.
50646. 
50647. "Well then, remember, this is not a joke!"
50648. 
50649. "Of course not!"
50650. 
50651. "Yes, yes," the governor's wife said as if talking to herself. "But,
50652. my dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other, the
50653. blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really...."
50654. 
50655. "Oh no, we are good friends with him," said Nicholas in the simplicity
50656. of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to
50657. himself might not be pleasant to someone else.
50658. 
50659. "But what nonsense I have been saying to the governor's wife!" thought
50660. Nicholas suddenly at supper. "She will really begin to arrange a
50661. match... and Sonya...?" And on taking leave of the governor's wife,
50662. when she again smilingly said to him, "Well then, remember!" he drew her
50663. aside.
50664. 
50665. "But see here, to tell the truth, Aunt..."
50666. 
50667. "What is it, my dear? Come, let's sit down here," said she.
50668. 
50669. Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate
50670. thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or
50671. his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he afterwards
50672. recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which
50673. had very important results for him, it seemed to him--as it seems to
50674. everyone in such cases--that it was merely some silly whim that seized
50675. him: yet that burst of frankness, together with other trifling events,
50676. had immense consequences for him and for all his family.
50677. 
50678. "You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the
50679. very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me."
50680. 
50681. "Oh yes, I understand," said the governor's wife.
50682. 
50683. "But Princess Bolkonskaya--that's another matter. I will tell you the
50684. truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to her; and
50685. then, after I met her under such circumstances--so strangely, the idea
50686. often occurred to me: 'This is fate.' Especially if you remember that
50687. Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never happened to meet her
50688. before, somehow it had always happened that we did not meet. And as long
50689. as my sister Natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of
50690. the question for me to think of marrying her. And it must needs happen
50691. that I should meet her just when Natasha's engagement had been broken
50692. off... and then everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone
50693. and never will, only to you."
50694. 
50695. The governor's wife pressed his elbow gratefully.
50696. 
50697. "You know Sonya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her, and
50698. will do so.... So you see there can be no question about-" said Nicholas
50699. incoherently and blushing.
50700. 
50701. "My dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know Sonya has nothing and
50702. you yourself say your Papa's affairs are in a very bad way. And what
50703. about your mother? It would kill her, that's one thing. And what sort of
50704. life would it be for Sonya--if she's a girl with a heart? Your mother
50705. in despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and Sonya ought to
50706. understand that."
50707. 
50708. Nicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.
50709. 
50710. "All the same, Aunt, it is impossible," he rejoined with a sigh, after
50711. a short pause. "Besides, would the princess have me? And besides, she is
50712. now in mourning. How can one think of it!"
50713. 
50714. "But you don't suppose I'm going to get you married at once? There is
50715. always a right way of doing things," replied the governor's wife.
50716. 
50717. "What a matchmaker you are, Aunt..." said Nicholas, kissing her plump
50718. little hand.
50719. 
50720. 
50721. 
50722. 
50723. 
50724. CHAPTER VI
50725. 
50726. 
50727. On reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rostov, Princess Mary had
50728. found her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from Prince Andrew
50729. giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malvintseva at Voronezh.
50730. That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her
50731. father's illness, since his death, and especially since her meeting with
50732. Rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey, anxiety about her
50733. brother, settling in a new house, meeting new people, and attending to
50734. her nephew's education. She was sad. Now, after a month passed in quiet
50735. surroundings, she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which
50736. was associated in her mind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and
50737. incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother,
50738. the only intimate person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was
50739. worried too about her nephew's education for which she had always felt
50740. herself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace--a
50741. peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams
50742. and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were
50743. related to her meeting with Rostov.
50744. 
50745. The day after her party the governor's wife came to see Malvintseva
50746. and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though
50747. under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, not to be
50748. thought of, all the same the young people might be brought together and
50749. could get to know one another. Malvintseva expressed approval, and the
50750. governor's wife began to speak of Rostov in Mary's presence, praising
50751. him and telling how he had blushed when Princess Mary's name was
50752. mentioned. But Princess Mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful
50753. feeling--her mental tranquillity was destroyed, and desires, doubts,
50754. self-reproach, and hopes reawoke.
50755. 
50756. During the two days that elapsed before Rostov called, Princess Mary
50757. continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she decided
50758. not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt--that it
50759. would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to receive visitors;
50760. then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her; then
50761. it occurred to her that her aunt and the governor's wife had intentions
50762. concerning herself and Rostov--their looks and words at times seemed to
50763. confirm this supposition--then she told herself that only she, with
50764. her sinful nature, could think this of them: they could not forget that
50765. situated as she was, while still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking
50766. would be an insult to her and to her father's memory. Assuming that she
50767. did go down to see him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say
50768. to her and what she would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed
50769. undeservedly cold and then to mean too much. More than anything she
50770. feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as
50771. soon as she saw him.
50772. 
50773. But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing
50774. room that Count Rostov had called, the princess showed no confusion,
50775. only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new
50776. and radiant light.
50777. 
50778. "You have met him, Aunt?" said she in a calm voice, unable herself to
50779. understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.
50780. 
50781. When Rostov entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an
50782. instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then
50783. just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with
50784. shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose
50785. with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him,
50786. and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep
50787. womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in the drawing
50788. room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise. Herself a
50789. consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a
50790. man she wished to attract.
50791. 
50792. "Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly
50793. improved without my having noticed it. And above all, what tact and
50794. grace!" thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.
50795. 
50796. Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would
50797. have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that
50798. had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized that dear,
50799. loved face, a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to
50800. speak and act apart from her own will. From the time Rostov entered, her
50801. face became suddenly transformed. It was as if a light had been kindled
50802. in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate, skillful, artistic
50803. work on its sides, that previously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless,
50804. was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty. For the first
50805. time all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had
50806. lived appeared on the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction
50807. with herself, her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her
50808. meekness, love, and self-sacrifice--all this now shone in those radiant
50809. eyes, in her delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.
50810. 
50811. Rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He
50812. felt that the being before him was quite different from, and better
50813. than, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.
50814. 
50815. Their conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of the
50816. war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about
50817. it; they spoke of their last meeting--Nicholas trying to change
50818. the subject--they talked of the governor's kind wife, of Nicholas'
50819. relations, and of Princess Mary's.
50820. 
50821. She did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as soon
50822. as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of Russia's
50823. misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near
50824. her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him. Nicholas
50825. noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary's character
50826. with an observation unusual to him, and everything confirmed his
50827. conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being.
50828. Nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the
50829. princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and even when he thought of
50830. her, but in her presence he felt quite at ease, and said not at all what
50831. he had prepared, but what, quite appropriately, occurred to him at the
50832. moment.
50833. 
50834. When a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual when
50835. there are children, turned to Prince Andrew's little son, caressing him
50836. and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He took the boy on
50837. his knee, played with him, and looked round at Princess Mary. With a
50838. softened, happy, timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms
50839. of the man she loved. Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if
50840. understanding it, flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with
50841. good natured playfulness.
50842. 
50843. As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, and
50844. Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all
50845. the same the governor's wife went on with her matchmaking, passing on to
50846. Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice
50847. versa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary. For this
50848. purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop's
50849. house before Mass.
50850. 
50851. Though Rostov told the governor's wife that he would not make any
50852. declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.
50853. 
50854. As at Tilsit Rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody
50855. considered right was right, so now, after a short but sincere struggle
50856. between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice, and
50857. in obedient submission to circumstances, he chose the latter and yielded
50858. to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where. He
50859. knew that after his promise to Sonya it would be what he deemed base to
50860. declare his feelings to Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never
50861. act basely. But he also knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart)
50862. that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those
50863. who were guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing
50864. something very important--more important than anything he had ever done
50865. in his life.
50866. 
50867. After meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on
50868. externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him
50869. and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her as he
50870. had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met
50871. in society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time rapturously,
50872. thought about Sonya. He had pictured each of those young ladies as
50873. almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife,
50874. adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life:
50875. a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his wife's carriage,
50876. little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to her, and so on--and
50877. these pictures of the future had given him pleasure. But with Princess
50878. Mary, to whom they were trying to get him engaged, he could never
50879. picture anything of future married life. If he tried, his pictures
50880. seemed incongruous and false. It made him afraid.
50881. 
50882. 
50883. 
50884. 
50885. 
50886. CHAPTER VII
50887. 
50888. 
50889. The dreadful news of the battle of Borodino, of our losses in killed and
50890. wounded, and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow reached
50891. Voronezh in the middle of September. Princess Mary, having learned of
50892. her brother's wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of
50893. him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her again himself) to
50894. set off in search of Prince Andrew.
50895. 
50896. When he received the news of the battle of Borodino and the abandonment
50897. of Moscow, Rostov was not seized with despair, anger, the desire for
50898. vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but everything in Voronezh
50899. suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and he experienced an
50900. indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The conversations he heard
50901. seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to judge all these affairs
50902. and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear
50903. to him. He made haste to finish buying the horses, and often became
50904. unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster.
50905. 
50906. A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which
50907. Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory.
50908. He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military
50909. decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of subjects.
50910. When the service was over the governor's wife beckoned him to her.
50911. 
50912. "Have you seen the princess?" she asked, indicating with a movement of
50913. her head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond the choir.
50914. 
50915. Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile
50916. he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, timidity, and
50917. pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary, evidently engrossed
50918. by her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last time before leaving
50919. the church.
50920. 
50921. Nicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he had
50922. seen before, there was the same general expression of refined, inner,
50923. spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There was a
50924. pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had occurred
50925. before when she was present, Nicholas went up to her without waiting to
50926. be prompted by the governor's wife and not asking himself whether or not
50927. it was right and proper to address her here in church, and told her he
50928. had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul. As soon as
50929. she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face, lighting up both
50930. her sorrow and her joy.
50931. 
50932. "There is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess," said Rostov. "It
50933. is that if your brother, Prince Andrew Nikolievich, were not living, it
50934. would have been at once announced in the Gazette, as he is a colonel."
50935. 
50936. The princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but cheered
50937. by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.
50938. 
50939. "And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound" (the Gazette said
50940. it was a shell) "either proving fatal at once or being very slight,"
50941. continued Nicholas. "We must hope for the best, and I am sure..."
50942. 
50943. Princess Mary interrupted him.
50944. 
50945. "Oh, that would be so dread..." she began and, prevented by agitation
50946. from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as
50947. everything she did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully,
50948. went out, following her aunt.
50949. 
50950. That evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle some
50951. accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that business it
50952. was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed,
50953. and for a long time he paced up and down the room, reflecting on his
50954. life, a thing he rarely did.
50955. 
50956. Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met
50957. her in Smolensk province. His having encountered her in such exceptional
50958. circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as
50959. a good match, had drawn his particular attention to her. When he met her
50960. again in Voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing
50961. but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he
50962. observed in her at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and
50963. it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself
50964. of chances of meeting her. But that day's encounter in church had, he
50965. felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale,
50966. sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures,
50967. and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features
50968. agitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rostov could not bear to
50969. see the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not
50970. like Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy
50971. and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed
50972. the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible
50973. attraction.
50974. 
50975. "She must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!" he said to himself.
50976. "Why am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with Sonya?" And he
50977. involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and
50978. the abundance of it in the other--a spirituality he himself lacked and
50979. therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were
50980. he free. How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife.
50981. But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear picture
50982. presented itself to his mind. He had long ago pictured to himself a
50983. future with Sonya, and that was all clear and simple just because it
50984. had all been thought out and he knew all there was in Sonya, but it was
50985. impossible to picture a future with Princess Mary, because he did not
50986. understand her but simply loved her.
50987. 
50988. Reveries about Sonya had had something merry and playful in them, but to
50989. dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening.
50990. 
50991. "How she prayed!" he thought. "It was plain that her whole soul was in
50992. her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains, and I am
50993. sure her prayer will be answered. Why don't I pray for what I want?" he
50994. suddenly thought. "What do I want? To be free, released from Sonya...
50995. She was right," he thought, remembering what the governor's wife had
50996. said: "Nothing but misfortune can come of marrying Sonya. Muddles,
50997. grief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible muddles!
50998. Besides, I don't love her--not as I should. O, God! release me from
50999. this dreadful, inextricable position!" he suddenly began to pray. "Yes,
51000. prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not pray as
51001. Natasha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn into
51002. sugar--and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so.
51003. No, but I am not praying for trifles now," he thought as he put his pipe
51004. down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself before the icon.
51005. Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not
51006. done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the
51007. door opened and Lavrushka came in with some papers.
51008. 
51009. "Blockhead! Why do you come in without being called?" cried Nicholas,
51010. quickly changing his attitude.
51011. 
51012. "From the governor," said Lavrushka in a sleepy voice. "A courier has
51013. arrived and there's a letter for you."
51014. 
51015. "Well, all right, thanks. You can go!"
51016. 
51017. Nicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother and
51018. the other from Sonya. He recognized them by the handwriting and opened
51019. Sonya's first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his
51020. eyes opened wide with fear and joy.
51021. 
51022. "No, it's not possible!" he cried aloud.
51023. 
51024. Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and
51025. reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then again,
51026. and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders,
51027. stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed.
51028. What he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear
51029. him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were
51030. something extraordinary and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it
51031. had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he
51032. had prayed, but by some ordinary coincidence.
51033. 
51034. This unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary letter
51035. from Sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which
51036. there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last unfortunate
51037. events--the loss of almost the whole of the Rostovs' Moscow
51038. property--and the countess' repeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas
51039. should marry Princess Bolkonskaya, together with his silence and
51040. coldness of late, had all combined to make her decide to release him
51041. from his promise and set him completely free.
51042. 
51043. 
51044. It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow
51045. or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my
51046. love has no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I
51047. beg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured that, in spite of
51048. everything, no one can love you more than does
51049. 
51050. Your Sonya
51051. 
51052. 
51053. Both letters were written from Troitsa. The other, from the countess,
51054. described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and
51055. the destruction of all their property. In this letter the countess also
51056. mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them;
51057. his state was very critical, but the doctor said there was now more
51058. hope. Sonya and Natasha were nursing him.
51059. 
51060. Next day Nicholas took his mother's letter and went to see Princess
51061. Mary. Neither he nor she said a word about what "Natasha nursing him"
51062. might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as
51063. intimate with the princess as if they were relations.
51064. 
51065. The following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to Yaroslavl,
51066. and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment.
51067. 
51068. 
51069. 
51070. 
51071. 
51072. CHAPTER VIII
51073. 
51074. 
51075. Sonya's letter written from Troitsa, which had come as an answer to
51076. Nicholas' prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting Nicholas
51077. married to an heiress occupied the old countess' mind more and more. She
51078. knew that Sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening, and Sonya's
51079. life in the countess' house had grown harder and harder, especially
51080. after they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting
51081. with Princess Mary in Bogucharovo. The countess let no occasion slip of
51082. making humiliating or cruel allusions to Sonya.
51083. 
51084. But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that
51085. was going on, she called Sonya to her and, instead of reproaching and
51086. making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself
51087. and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her
51088. engagement with Nicholas.
51089. 
51090. "I shall not be at peace till you promise me this."
51091. 
51092. Sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that
51093. she would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave no actual
51094. promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded
51095. of her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and
51096. brought her up. To sacrifice herself for others was Sonya's habit. Her
51097. position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her
51098. worth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her
51099. former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they
51100. raised her in her own esteem and in that of others, and so made her more
51101. worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world. But
51102. now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the
51103. whole reward for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life.
51104. And for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been
51105. her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous
51106. of Natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort, had never
51107. needed to sacrifice herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for
51108. her and yet was beloved by everybody. And for the first time Sonya felt
51109. that out of her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling
51110. was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue,
51111. or religion. Under the influence of this feeling Sonya, whose life of
51112. dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered
51113. the countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and
51114. resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him
51115. free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.
51116. 
51117. The bustle and terror of the Rostovs' last days in Moscow stifled the
51118. gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sonya. She was glad to find escape
51119. from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince Andrew's
51120. presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and for
51121. Natasha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God
51122. did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that Natasha
51123. loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him. She
51124. knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances
51125. they would again fall in love with one another, and that Nicholas would
51126. then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would be within the
51127. prohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror of what had
51128. happened during those last days and during the first days of their
51129. journey, this feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal
51130. affairs cheered Sonya.
51131. 
51132. At the Troitsa monastery the Rostovs first broke their journey for a
51133. whole day.
51134. 
51135. Three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry, one
51136. of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much better
51137. that day and Natasha was sitting with him. In the next room sat the
51138. count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was
51139. calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.
51140. Sonya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew and
51141. Natasha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices through
51142. the door. That door opened and Natasha came out, looking excited. Not
51143. noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the
51144. wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to Sonya and took her hand.
51145. 
51146. "Natasha, what are you about? Come here!" said the countess.
51147. 
51148. Natasha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to pray
51149. for aid to God and His saint.
51150. 
51151. As soon as the prior withdrew, Natasha took her friend by the hand and
51152. went with her into the unoccupied room.
51153. 
51154. "Sonya, will he live?" she asked. "Sonya, how happy I am, and how
51155. unhappy!... Sonya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he
51156. lives! He cannot... because... because... of" and Natasha burst into
51157. tears.
51158. 
51159. "Yes! I knew it! Thank God!" murmured Sonya. "He will live."
51160. 
51161. Sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter's fear and
51162. grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.
51163. Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Natasha. "If only he lives!" she
51164. thought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two
51165. friends went together to Prince Andrew's door. Natasha opened it
51166. cautiously and glanced into the room, Sonya standing beside her at the
51167. half-open door.
51168. 
51169. Prince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale face was
51170. calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular breathing.
51171. 
51172. "O, Natasha!" Sonya suddenly almost screamed, catching her companion's
51173. arm and stepping back from the door.
51174. 
51175. "What? What is it?" asked Natasha.
51176. 
51177. "It's that, that..." said Sonya, with a white face and trembling lips.
51178. 
51179. Natasha softly closed the door and went with Sonya to the window, not
51180. yet understanding what the latter was telling her.
51181. 
51182. "You remember," said Sonya with a solemn and frightened expression.
51183. "You remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at Otradnoe at
51184. Christmas? Do you remember what I saw?"
51185. 
51186. "Yes, yes!" cried Natasha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely recalling
51187. that Sonya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom she had seen
51188. lying down.
51189. 
51190. "You remember?" Sonya went on. "I saw it then and told everybody, you
51191. and Dunyasha. I saw him lying on a bed," said she, making a gesture with
51192. her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, "and that he had his eyes
51193. closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were
51194. folded," she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just
51195. seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror.
51196. 
51197. She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that
51198. came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed to her now
51199. as real as any other recollection. She not only remembered what she had
51200. then said--that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with
51201. something red--but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said
51202. that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed.
51203. 
51204. "Yes, yes, it really was pink!" cried Natasha, who now thought she
51205. too remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most
51206. extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.
51207. 
51208. "But what does it mean?" she added meditatively.
51209. 
51210. "Oh, I don't know, it is all so strange," replied Sonya, clutching at
51211. her head.
51212. 
51213. A few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Natasha went to him, but
51214. Sonya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the window
51215. thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred.
51216. 
51217. 
51218. They had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and the
51219. countess was writing to her son.
51220. 
51221. "Sonya!" said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as her
51222. niece passed, "Sonya, won't you write to Nicholas?" She spoke in a soft,
51223. tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles
51224. Sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words. Those
51225. eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and
51226. readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.
51227. 
51228. Sonya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.
51229. 
51230. "Yes, Mamma, I will write," said she.
51231. 
51232. Sonya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred that
51233. day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her
51234. vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Natasha's relations with
51235. Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary, she
51236. was joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in
51237. which she was accustomed to live and loved to live. So with a joyful
51238. consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed--interrupted several
51239. times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes--she wrote that
51240. touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas.
51241. 
51242. 
51243. 
51244. 
51245. 
51246. CHAPTER IX
51247. 
51248. 
51249. The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with
51250. hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was taken.
51251. In their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as
51252. to who he might be--perhaps a very important person--and hostility as a
51253. result of their recent personal conflict with him.
51254. 
51255. But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the
51256. new guard--both officers and men--he was not as interesting as he had
51257. been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not
51258. recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person
51259. who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had
51260. uttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only
51261. No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason
51262. by order of the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable
51263. about Pierre, it was only his unabashed, meditative concentration
51264. and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke French, which struck them as
51265. surprisingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the
51266. other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was
51267. required by an officer.
51268. 
51269. All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and,
51270. recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as
51271. he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.
51272. 
51273. That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among
51274. them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was taken
51275. with the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache
51276. sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms.
51277. With the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners,
51278. and which is supposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others
51279. was questioned as to who he was, where he had been, with what object,
51280. and so on.
51281. 
51282. These questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the
51283. essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that essence's
51284. being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel through which
51285. the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to
51286. the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as Pierre began to say
51287. anything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel was removed and
51288. the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused
51289. always feel at their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were
51290. put to him. He had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a
51291. kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed. He
51292. knew he was in these men's power, that only by force had they brought
51293. him there, that force alone gave them the right to demand answers
51294. to their questions, and that the sole object of that assembly was to
51295. inculpate him. And so, as they had the power and wish to inculpate
51296. him, this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary. It was
51297. evident that any answer would lead to conviction. When asked what he
51298. was doing when he was arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner
51299. that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the
51300. flames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he "was
51301. protecting a woman," and that "to protect a woman who was being insulted
51302. was the duty of every man; that..." They interrupted him, for this
51303. was not to the point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where
51304. witnesses had seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what
51305. was happening in Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked
51306. where he was going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they
51307. asked, repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer.
51308. Again he replied that he could not answer it.
51309. 
51310. "Put that down, that's bad... very bad," sternly remarked the general
51311. with the white mustache and red flushed face.
51312. 
51313. 
51314. On the fourth day fires broke out on the Zubovski rampart.
51315. 
51316. Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant's
51317. house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the streets Pierre
51318. felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole
51319. city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize the
51320. significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires with
51321. horror.
51322. 
51323. He passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and
51324. during that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that all
51325. those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day
51326. from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn from the
51327. soldiers. Evidently for them "the marshal" represented a very high and
51328. rather mysterious power.
51329. 
51330. These first days, before the eighth of September when the prisoners were
51331. had up for a second examination, were the hardest of all for Pierre.
51332. 
51333. 
51334. 
51335. 
51336. 
51337. CHAPTER X
51338. 
51339. 
51340. On the eighth of September an officer--a very important one judging by
51341. the respect the guards showed him--entered the coach house where the
51342. prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding
51343. a paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, naming
51344. Pierre as "the man who does not give his name." Glancing indolently and
51345. indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge
51346. to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the
51347. marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with
51348. thirteen others was led to the Virgin's Field. It was a fine day, sunny
51349. after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke did not hang low
51350. as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the
51351. Zubovski rampart, but rose through the pure air in columns. No flames
51352. were seen, but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all Moscow as far
51353. as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin. On all sides there were
51354. waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing, and
51355. here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed
51356. at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well. Here and
51357. there he could see churches that had not been burned. The Kremlin, which
51358. was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and
51359. the belfry of Ivan the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin
51360. glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.
51361. These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the
51362. Nativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this
51363. holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to be
51364. seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw
51365. the French.
51366. 
51367. It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but in
51368. place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre
51369. unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order had been
51370. established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the looks of
51371. the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily, were
51372. escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the looks of an
51373. important French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier,
51374. whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of regimental
51375. music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt and realized
51376. it especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had read out
51377. when he came that morning. Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers
51378. and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men,
51379. and it seemed that they might have forgotten him, or confused him with
51380. the others. But no: the answers he had given when questioned had come
51381. back to him in his designation as "the man who does not give his name,"
51382. and under that appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were
51383. now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces
51384. that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted
51385. and that they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself
51386. to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose
51387. action he did not understand but which was working well.
51388. 
51389. He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin's
51390. Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the
51391. convent. This was Prince Shcherbitov's house, where Pierre had often
51392. been in other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of the
51393. soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of Eckmuhl (Davout).
51394. 
51395. They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.
51396. Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass gallery,
51397. an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low
51398. study at the door of which stood an adjutant.
51399. 
51400. Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of
51401. the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting
51402. a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes,
51403. he said in a low voice:
51404. 
51405. "Who are you?"
51406. 
51407. Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To him
51408. Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for his
51409. cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster
51410. who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every
51411. instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what
51412. to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first
51413. examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and
51414. embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had decided what to do,
51415. Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back on his forehead,
51416. screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.
51417. 
51418. "I know that man," he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently
51419. calculated to frighten Pierre.
51420. 
51421. The chill that had been running down Pierre's back now seized his head
51422. as in a vise.
51423. 
51424. "You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you..."
51425. 
51426. "He is a Russian spy," Davout interrupted, addressing another general
51427. who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.
51428. 
51429. Davout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice Pierre
51430. rapidly began:
51431. 
51432. "No, monseigneur," he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke.
51433. "No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia officer and
51434. have not quitted Moscow."
51435. 
51436. "Your name?" asked Davout.
51437. 
51438. "Bezukhov."
51439. 
51440. "What proof have I that you are not lying?"
51441. 
51442. "Monseigneur!" exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a pleading
51443. voice.
51444. 
51445. Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they looked
51446. at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of war
51447. and law, that look established human relations between the two men. At
51448. that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their
51449. minds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and
51450. were brothers.
51451. 
51452. At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the
51453. papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre
51454. was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without
51455. burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a
51456. human being. He reflected for a moment.
51457. 
51458. "How can you show me that you are telling the truth?" said Davout
51459. coldly.
51460. 
51461. Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the
51462. street where the house was.
51463. 
51464. "You are not what you say," returned Davout.
51465. 
51466. In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the
51467. truth of his statements.
51468. 
51469. But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout.
51470. 
51471. Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began
51472. buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre.
51473. 
51474. When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head in
51475. Pierre's direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But
51476. where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house
51477. or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as
51478. they crossed the Virgin's Field.
51479. 
51480. He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another
51481. question to Davout.
51482. 
51483. "Yes, of course!" replied Davout, but what this "yes" meant, Pierre did
51484. not know.
51485. 
51486. Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was far, or
51487. in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was stupefied,
51488. and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others
51489. did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his
51490. mind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to
51491. death? Not the men on the commission that had first examined him--not
51492. one of them wished to or, evidently, could have done it. It was not
51493. Davout, who had looked at him in so human a way. In another moment
51494. Davout would have realized that he was doing wrong, but just then
51495. the adjutant had come in and interrupted him. The adjutant, also, had
51496. evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming
51497. in. Then who was executing him, killing him, depriving him of life--him,
51498. Pierre, with all his memories, aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was
51499. doing this? And Pierre felt that it was no one.
51500. 
51501. It was a system--a concurrence of circumstances.
51502. 
51503. A system of some sort was killing him--Pierre--depriving him of life, of
51504. everything, annihilating him.
51505. 
51506. 
51507. 
51508. 
51509. 
51510. CHAPTER XI
51511. 
51512. 
51513. From Prince Shcherbatov's house the prisoners were led straight down the
51514. Virgin's Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen garden
51515. in which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been
51516. dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood
51517. in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many of
51518. Napoleon's soldiers who were not on duty--Germans, Italians, and
51519. Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of the post
51520. stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high
51521. boots and shakos.
51522. 
51523. The prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list
51524. (Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums suddenly
51525. began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre felt as
51526. if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of thinking
51527. or understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only one
51528. wish--that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly.
51529. Pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.
51530. 
51531. The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin,
51532. the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was
51533. a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a
51534. plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome
51535. man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes. The fifth was a
51536. factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat.
51537. 
51538. Pierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately or
51539. two at a time. "In couples," replied the officer in command in a calm
51540. voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident
51541. that they were all hurrying--not as men hurry to do something they
51542. understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and
51543. incomprehensible task.
51544. 
51545. A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of
51546. prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.
51547. 
51548. Then two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the
51549. officer's command took the two convicts who stood first in the row. The
51550. convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks were being
51551. brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching
51552. huntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other scratched his back
51553. and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands
51554. the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and
51555. bound them to the post.
51556. 
51557. Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm
51558. regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned away
51559. to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling
51560. noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific
51561. thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen
51562. were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands.
51563. Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks,
51564. these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for
51565. protection in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe
51566. what was going to happen to them. They could not believe it because they
51567. alone knew what their life meant to them, and so they neither understood
51568. nor believed that it could be taken from them.
51569. 
51570. Again Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again the
51571. sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the same moment
51572. he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who
51573. were again doing something by the post, their trembling hands impeding
51574. one another. Pierre, breathing heavily, looked around as if asking what
51575. it meant. The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his.
51576. 
51577. On the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and officers
51578. without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and conflict that
51579. were in his own heart. "But who, after all, is doing this? They are all
51580. suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?" flashed for an instant through
51581. his mind.
51582. 
51583. "Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!" shouted someone. The fifth
51584. prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away--alone. Pierre did not
51585. understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been brought
51586. there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror, and no
51587. sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place. The fifth man
51588. was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment they laid hands on
51589. him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered
51590. and shook himself free.) The lad was unable to walk. They dragged him
51591. along, holding him up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got
51592. him to the post he grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something.
51593. Whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought
51594. it incredible that men should kill him, at any rate he took his stand at
51595. the post, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded
51596. animal looked around him with glittering eyes.
51597. 
51598. Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity
51599. and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch
51600. at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he
51601. wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other.
51602. 
51603. When they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which
51604. hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against the
51605. bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in that
51606. position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back again
51607. more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss
51608. his slightest movement.
51609. 
51610. Probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of
51611. eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember
51612. having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw how the
51613. workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how blood showed
51614. itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of the
51615. hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally
51616. and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one hindered
51617. him. Pale, frightened people were doing something around the workman.
51618. The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he
51619. untied the ropes. The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awkwardly
51620. from the post and began pushing it into the pit.
51621. 
51622. They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must
51623. hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.
51624. 
51625. Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with
51626. his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other.
51627. That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, but spadefuls
51628. of earth were already being thrown over the whole body. One of the
51629. soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to
51630. go back. But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the post,
51631. and no one drove him away.
51632. 
51633. When the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was taken
51634. back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the post
51635. made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The twenty-four
51636. sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the center of the
51637. circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed by.
51638. 
51639. Pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in
51640. couples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies. This
51641. one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed back, and
51642. his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit at the spot
51643. from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man, taking some steps
51644. forward and back to save himself from falling. An old, noncommissioned
51645. officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to
51646. his company. The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse. They
51647. all went away silently and with drooping heads.
51648. 
51649. "That will teach them to start fires," said one of the Frenchmen.
51650. 
51651. Pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who
51652. was trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was not
51653. able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a
51654. hopeless movement with his arm and went away.
51655. 
51656. 
51657. 
51658. 
51659. 
51660. CHAPTER XII
51661. 
51662. 
51663. After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners
51664. and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.
51665. 
51666. Toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and
51667. told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for
51668. the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said to him, Pierre
51669. got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the upper end of the
51670. field, where there were some sheds built of charred planks, beams,
51671. and battens, and led him into one of them. In the darkness some twenty
51672. different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at them without understanding
51673. who they were, why they were there, or what they wanted of him. He heard
51674. what they said, but did not understand the meaning of the words and
51675. made no kind of deduction from or application of them. He replied to
51676. questions they put to him, but did not consider who was listening to his
51677. replies, nor how they would understand them. He looked at their faces
51678. and figures, but they all seemed to him equally meaningless.
51679. 
51680. From the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by
51681. men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the mainspring of
51682. his life, on which everything depended and which made everything appear
51683. alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed
51684. into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not acknowledge it to
51685. himself, his faith in the right ordering of the universe, in humanity,
51686. in his own soul, and in God, had been destroyed. He had experienced this
51687. before, but never so strongly as now. When similar doubts had assailed
51688. him before, they had been the result of his own wrongdoing, and at the
51689. bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from
51690. those doubts was to be found within himself. But now he felt that
51691. the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins
51692. remained, and this not by any fault of his own. He felt that it was not
51693. in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life.
51694. 
51695. Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something
51696. about him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and
51697. asking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he
51698. found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and
51699. talking on all sides.
51700. 
51701. "Well, then, mates... that very prince who..." some voice at the other
51702. end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word who.
51703. 
51704. Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall,
51705. Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as
51706. he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory
51707. lad--especially dreadful because of its simplicity--and the faces of the
51708. murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he opened
51709. his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him.
51710. 
51711. Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he
51712. was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from
51713. him every time he moved. This man was doing something to his legs in the
51714. darkness, and though Pierre could not see his face he felt that the man
51715. continually glanced at him. On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw
51716. that the man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused
51717. Pierre's interest.
51718. 
51719. Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he carefully
51720. coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg, glancing up
51721. at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the other was already
51722. unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way, having carefully
51723. removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following
51724. one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs
51725. fixed above his head. Then he took out a knife, cut something, closed
51726. the knife, placed it under the head of his bed, and, seating himself
51727. comfortably, clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes
51728. on Pierre. The latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting,
51729. and well rounded in these deft movements, in the man's well-ordered
51730. arrangements in his corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at
51731. the man without taking his eyes from him.
51732. 
51733. "You've seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?" the little man suddenly said.
51734. 
51735. And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice
51736. that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears
51737. rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time to betray
51738. his confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant tones:
51739. 
51740. "Eh, lad, don't fret!" said he, in the tender singsong caressing voice
51741. old Russian peasant women employ. "Don't fret, friend--'suffer an hour,
51742. live for an age!' that's how it is, my dear fellow. And here we live,
51743. thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too, there are good
51744. men as well as bad," said he, and still speaking, he turned on his knees
51745. with a supple movement, got up, coughed, and went off to another part of
51746. the shed.
51747. 
51748. "Eh, you rascal!" Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other
51749. end of the shed. "So you've come, you rascal? She remembers... Now, now,
51750. that'll do!"
51751. 
51752. And the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at
51753. him, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something
51754. wrapped in a rag.
51755. 
51756. "Here, eat a bit, sir," said he, resuming his former respectful tone as
51757. he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. "We had soup for
51758. dinner and the potatoes are grand!"
51759. 
51760. Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed
51761. extremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.
51762. 
51763. "Well, are they all right?" said the soldier with a smile. "You should
51764. do like this."
51765. 
51766. He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two
51767. equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the
51768. rag, and handed it to Pierre.
51769. 
51770. "The potatoes are grand!" he said once more. "Eat some like that!"
51771. 
51772. Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.
51773. 
51774. "Oh, I'm all right," said he, "but why did they shoot those poor
51775. fellows? The last one was hardly twenty."
51776. 
51777. "Tss, tt...!" said the little man. "Ah, what a sin... what a sin!" he
51778. added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his
51779. mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: "How was it, sir, that you
51780. stayed in Moscow?"
51781. 
51782. "I didn't think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally," replied
51783. Pierre.
51784. 
51785. "And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?"
51786. 
51787. "No, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and tried
51788. me as an incendiary."
51789. 
51790. "Where there's law there's injustice," put in the little man.
51791. 
51792. "And have you been here long?" Pierre asked as he munched the last of
51793. the potato.
51794. 
51795. "I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow."
51796. 
51797. "Why, are you a soldier then?"
51798. 
51799. "Yes, we are soldiers of the Apsheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We
51800. weren't told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had
51801. no idea, never guessed at all."
51802. 
51803. "And do you feel sad here?" Pierre inquired.
51804. 
51805. "How can one help it, lad? My name is Platon, and the surname is
51806. Karataev," he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to
51807. address him. "They call me 'little falcon' in the regiment. How is one
51808. to help feeling sad? Moscow--she's the mother of cities. How can one see
51809. all this and not feel sad? But 'the maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies
51810. first'; that's what the old folks used to tell us," he added rapidly.
51811. 
51812. "What? What did you say?" asked Pierre.
51813. 
51814. "Who? I?" said Karataev. "I say things happen not as we plan but as God
51815. judges," he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said
51816. before, and immediately continued:
51817. 
51818. "Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have
51819. abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still
51820. living?" he asked.
51821. 
51822. And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed
51823. smile of kindliness puckered the soldier's lips as he put these
51824. questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that
51825. he had no mother.
51826. 
51827. "A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there's none as
51828. dear as one's own mother!" said he. "Well, and have you little ones?" he
51829. went on asking.
51830. 
51831. Again Pierre's negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened
51832. to add:
51833. 
51834. "Never mind! You're young folks yet, and please God may still have some.
51835. The great thing is to live in harmony...."
51836. 
51837. "But it's all the same now," Pierre could not help saying.
51838. 
51839. "Ah, my dear fellow!" rejoined Karataev, "never decline a prison or a
51840. beggar's sack!"
51841. 
51842. He seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently preparing to
51843. tell a long story.
51844. 
51845. "Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at home," he began. "We had
51846. a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and our
51847. house was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing
51848. there were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so
51849. happened..."
51850. 
51851. And Platon Karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someone's
51852. copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, had been
51853. tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.
51854. 
51855. "Well, lad," and a smile changed the tone of his voice "we thought it
51856. was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been for
51857. my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger
51858. brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife
51859. behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a
51860. soldier. I come home on leave and I'll tell you how it was, I look and
51861. see that they are living better than before. The yard full of cattle,
51862. the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the
51863. youngest, at home. Father, he says, 'All my children are the same to
51864. me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if Platon hadn't
51865. been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to go.' called us
51866. all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons.
51867. 'Michael,' he says, 'come here and bow down to his feet; and you, young
51868. woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also bow down before
51869. him! Do you understand?' he says. That's how it is, dear fellow. Fate
51870. looks for a head. But we are always judging, 'that's not well--that's
51871. not right!' Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it
51872. bulges, but when you've drawn it out it's empty! That's how it is."
51873. 
51874. And Platon shifted his seat on the straw.
51875. 
51876. After a short silence he rose.
51877. 
51878. "Well, I think you must be sleepy," said he, and began rapidly crossing
51879. himself and repeating:
51880. 
51881. "Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus
51882. Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, have
51883. mercy on us and save us!" he concluded, then bowed to the ground, got
51884. up, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. "That's the way.
51885. Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf," he
51886. muttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.
51887. 
51888. "What prayer was that you were saying?" asked Pierre.
51889. 
51890. "Eh?" murmured Platon, who had almost fallen asleep. "What was I saying?
51891. I was praying. Don't you pray?"
51892. 
51893. "Yes, I do," said Pierre. "But what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?"
51894. 
51895. "Well, of course," replied Platon quickly, "the horses' saints. One must
51896. pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now you've curled up and got warm,
51897. you daughter of a bitch!" said Karataev, touching the dog that lay at
51898. his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.
51899. 
51900. Sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance
51901. outside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but
51902. inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep, but
51903. lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular snoring
51904. of Platon who lay beside him, and he felt that the world that had been
51905. shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on
51906. new and unshakable foundations.
51907. 
51908. 
51909. 
51910. 
51911. 
51912. CHAPTER XIII
51913. 
51914. 
51915. Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were confined
51916. in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for
51917. four weeks.
51918. 
51919. When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to
51920. him except Platon Karataev, who always remained in his mind a most
51921. vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything Russian,
51922. kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn
51923. the first impression of him, as of something round, was fully confirmed:
51924. Platon's whole figure--in a French overcoat girdled with a cord, a
51925. soldier's cap, and bast shoes--was round. His head was quite round,
51926. his back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever
51927. ready to embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his
51928. large, gentle brown eyes were also round.
51929. 
51930. Platon Karataev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of
51931. campaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not himself
51932. know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly
51933. white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he
51934. laughed--as he often did--were all sound and good, there was not a gray
51935. hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole body gave an impression
51936. of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance.
51937. 
51938. His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of
51939. innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief
51940. peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It was
51941. evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say,
51942. and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an
51943. irresistible persuasiveness.
51944. 
51945. His physical strength and agility during the first days of his
51946. imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and
51947. sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: "Lord, lay me
51948. down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!" and every morning on getting
51949. up, he said: "I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake myself." And
51950. indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he
51951. only had to shake himself, to be ready without a moment's delay for some
51952. work, just as children are ready to play directly they awake. He could
51953. do everything, not very well but not badly. He baked, cooked, sewed,
51954. planed, and mended boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed
51955. himself conversation--of which he was fond--and songs. He did not sing
51956. like a trained singer who knows he is listened to, but like the birds,
51957. evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches
51958. oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were
51959. always high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his
51960. face at such times was very serious.
51961. 
51962. Having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to
51963. have thrown off all that had been forced upon him--everything military
51964. and alien to himself--and had returned to his former peasant habits.
51965. 
51966. "A soldier on leave--a shirt outside breeches," he would say.
51967. 
51968. He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not
51969. complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during
51970. the whole of his army service. When he related anything it was generally
51971. some old and evidently precious memory of his "Christian" life, as he
51972. called his peasant existence. The proverbs, of which his talk was full,
51973. were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers
51974. employ, but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so
51975. insignificant, but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance
51976. of profound wisdom.
51977. 
51978. He would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous
51979. occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he talked well,
51980. adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which
51981. Pierre thought he invented himself, but the chief charm of his talk lay
51982. in the fact that the commonest events--sometimes just such as Pierre
51983. had witnessed without taking notice of them--assumed in Karataev's a
51984. character of solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the
51985. soldiers used to tell of an evening (they were always the same), but
51986. most of all he liked to hear stories of real life. He would smile
51987. joyfully when listening to such stories, now and then putting in a word
51988. or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear
51989. to himself. Karataev had no attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre
51990. understood them, but loved and lived affectionately with everything life
51991. brought him in contact with, particularly with man--not any particular
51992. man, but those with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his
51993. comrades, the French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt
51994. that in spite of Karataev's affectionate tenderness for him (by which
51995. he unconsciously gave Pierre's spiritual life its due) he would not have
51996. grieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in
51997. the same way toward Karataev.
51998. 
51999. To all the other prisoners Platon Karataev seemed a most ordinary
52000. soldier. They called him "little falcon" or "Platosha," chaffed him
52001. good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always
52002. remained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded,
52003. eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth.
52004. 
52005. Platon Karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he began
52006. to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.
52007. 
52008. Sometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask him to
52009. repeat them, but Platon could never recall what he had said a moment
52010. before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of his
52011. favorite song: native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in
52012. it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of it. He
52013. did not, and could not, understand the meaning of words apart from
52014. their context. Every word and action of his was the manifestation of
52015. an activity unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he
52016. regarded it, had no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only as
52017. part of a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and actions
52018. flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance
52019. exhales from a flower. He could not understand the value or significance
52020. of any word or deed taken separately.
52021. 
52022. 
52023. 
52024. 
52025. 
52026. CHAPTER XIV
52027. 
52028. 
52029. When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the
52030. Rostovs at Yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there, in spite of her
52031. aunt's efforts to dissuade her--and not merely to go herself but to
52032. take her nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy, possible
52033. or impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it was her duty
52034. not only herself to be near her brother who was perhaps dying, but to do
52035. everything possible to take his son to him, and so she prepared to set
52036. off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess Mary
52037. attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long
52038. journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.
52039. 
52040. In a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were the
52041. huge family coach in which she had traveled to Voronezh, a semiopen
52042. trap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne,
52043. little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, Tikhon, and a
52044. young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.
52045. 
52046. The usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the
52047. roundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through Lipetsk,
52048. Ryazan, Vladimir, and Shuya was very long and, as post horses were not
52049. everywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryazan where the French
52050. were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.
52051. 
52052. During this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and
52053. Princess Mary's servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of
52054. spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and
52055. no difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy, which
52056. infected her fellow travelers, they approached Yaroslavl by the end of
52057. the second week.
52058. 
52059. The last days of her stay in Voronezh had been the happiest of her life.
52060. Her love for Rostov no longer tormented or agitated her. It filled her
52061. whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she no longer
52062. struggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that she loved
52063. and was beloved, though she never said this definitely to herself
52064. in words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview with
52065. Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the
52066. Rostovs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that
52067. Prince Andrew's relations with Natasha might, if he recovered, be
52068. renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of
52069. this.
52070. 
52071. Yet in spite of that, his relation to her--considerate, delicate, and
52072. loving--not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to Princess
52073. Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them
52074. allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew that she
52075. loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was
52076. beloved, and was happy in regard to it.
52077. 
52078. But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent
52079. her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that
52080. spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her
52081. to give full play to her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so
52082. strong at the moment of leaving Voronezh that those who saw her off, as
52083. they looked at her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall
52084. ill on the journey. But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the
52085. journey, which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from
52086. her grief and gave her strength.
52087. 
52088. As always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the
52089. journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached Yaroslavl
52090. the thought of what might await her there--not after many days, but that
52091. very evening--again presented itself to her and her agitation increased
52092. to its utmost limit.
52093. 
52094. The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the
52095. Rostovs were staying in Yaroslavl, and in what condition Prince Andrew
52096. was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled
52097. by the terrible pallor of the princess' face that looked out at him from
52098. the window.
52099. 
52100. "I have found out everything, your excellency: the Rostovs are staying
52101. at the merchant Bronnikov's house, in the Square not far from here,
52102. right above the Volga," said the courier.
52103. 
52104. Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding
52105. why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her
52106. brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.
52107. 
52108. "How is the prince?" she asked.
52109. 
52110. "His excellency is staying in the same house with them."
52111. 
52112. "Then he is alive," thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice:
52113. "How is he?"
52114. 
52115. "The servants say he is still the same."
52116. 
52117. What "still the same" might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an
52118. unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting in
52119. front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head
52120. and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and
52121. swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as they were let
52122. down.
52123. 
52124. The carriage door was opened. On the left there was water--a great
52125. river--and on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance:
52126. servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as
52127. it seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This was
52128. Sonya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. "This way, this way!" said the
52129. girl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found herself in
52130. the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came rapidly to
52131. meet her with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She embraced
52132. Princess Mary and kissed her.
52133. 
52134. "Mon enfant!" she muttered, "je vous aime et vous connais depuis
52135. longtemps." *
52136. 
52137. 
52138.     * "My child! I love you and have known you a long time."
52139. 
52140. 
52141.  Despite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the
52142. countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly
52143. knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in
52144. French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and
52145. asked: "How is he?"
52146. 
52147. "The doctor says that he is not in danger," said the countess, but as
52148. she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a
52149. contradiction of her words.
52150. 
52151. "Where is he? Can I see him--can I?" asked the princess.
52152. 
52153. "One moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?" said the
52154. countess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with Dessalles.
52155. "There will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh, what a
52156. lovely boy!"
52157. 
52158. The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where Sonya was
52159. talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the boy, and
52160. the old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had changed very
52161. much since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had been a brisk,
52162. cheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered
52163. person. While talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as
52164. if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing. After the
52165. destruction of Moscow and of his property, thrown out of his accustomed
52166. groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to
52167. feel that there was no longer a place for him in life.
52168. 
52169. In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible, and
52170. her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they
52171. should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew,
52172. the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the
52173. necessity of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things which
52174. she had entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it was hard for
52175. her she was not vexed with these people.
52176. 
52177. "This is my niece," said the count, introducing Sonya--"You don't know
52178. her, Princess?"
52179. 
52180. Princess Mary turned to Sonya and, trying to stifle the hostile
52181. feeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt
52182. oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far
52183. from what was in her own heart.
52184. 
52185. "Where is he?" she asked again, addressing them all.
52186. 
52187. "He is downstairs. Natasha is with him," answered Sonya, flushing. "We
52188. have sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess."
52189. 
52190. Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary's eyes. She turned
52191. away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when
52192. light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the
52193. door. The princess looked round and saw Natasha coming in, almost
52194. running--that Natasha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in
52195. Moscow long since.
52196. 
52197. But hardly had the princess looked at Natasha's face before she realized
52198. that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a friend.
52199. She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her shoulder.
52200. 
52201. As soon as Natasha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrew's bed, heard
52202. of Princess Mary's arrival, she softly left his room and hastened to her
52203. with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Princess Mary.
52204. 
52205. There was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the
52206. drawing room--that of love--boundless love for him, for her, and for all
52207. that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for others,
52208. and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them. It was
52209. plain that at that moment there was in Natasha's heart no thought of
52210. herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.
52211. 
52212. Princess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at the
52213. first glance at Natasha's face, and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful
52214. pleasure.
52215. 
52216. "Come, come to him, Mary," said Natasha, leading her into the other
52217. room.
52218. 
52219. Princess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to Natasha.
52220. She felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn
52221. everything.
52222. 
52223. "How..." she began her question but stopped short.
52224. 
52225. She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words.
52226. Natasha's face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and
52227. profoundly.
52228. 
52229. Natasha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say
52230. all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes
52231. which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was impossible
52232. not to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly, Natasha's lips
52233. twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face
52234. with her hands she burst into sobs.
52235. 
52236. Princess Mary understood.
52237. 
52238. But she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:
52239. 
52240. "But how is his wound? What is his general condition?"
52241. 
52242. "You, you... will see," was all Natasha could say.
52243. 
52244. They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off
52245. crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.
52246. 
52247. "How has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse? When
52248. did this happen?" Princess Mary inquired.
52249. 
52250. Natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish
52251. condition and the pain he suffered, but at Troitsa that had passed
52252. and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger had also
52253. passed. When they reached Yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester
52254. (Natasha knew all about such things as festering) and the doctor had
52255. said that the festering might take a normal course. Then fever set in,
52256. but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.
52257. 
52258. "But two days ago this suddenly happened," said Natasha, struggling with
52259. her sobs. "I don't know why, but you will see what he is like."
52260. 
52261. "Is he weaker? Thinner?" asked the princess.
52262. 
52263. "No, it's not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too good, he
52264. cannot, cannot live, because..."
52265. 
52266. 
52267. 
52268. 
52269. 
52270. CHAPTER XV
52271. 
52272. 
52273. When Natasha opened Prince Andrew's door with a familiar movement and
52274. let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the
52275. sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now
52276. tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at
52277. him without tears.
52278. 
52279. The princess understood what Natasha had meant by the words: "two days
52280. ago this suddenly happened." She understood those words to mean that he
52281. had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs
52282. of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in
52283. imagination Andrew's face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle,
52284. mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore
52285. affected her very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender
52286. words to her such as her father had uttered before his death, and
52287. that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his
52288. presence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, and she went in. The sobs
52289. rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly
52290. distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his
52291. features, and then she saw his face and met his gaze.
52292. 
52293. He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by
52294. pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand
52295. he held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate
52296. mustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them
52297. as they entered.
52298. 
52299. On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary's pace suddenly
52300. slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She suddenly
52301. felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and
52302. eyes.
52303. 
52304. "But in what am I to blame?" she asked herself. And his cold, stern look
52305. replied: "Because you are alive and thinking of the living, while I..."
52306. 
52307. In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there
52308. was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and
52309. Natasha.
52310. 
52311. He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.
52312. 
52313. "How are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?" said he in a voice
52314. as calm and aloof as his look.
52315. 
52316. Had he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such horror
52317. into Princess Mary's heart as the tone of his voice.
52318. 
52319. "And have you brought little Nicholas?" he asked in the same slow, quiet
52320. manner and with an obvious effort to remember.
52321. 
52322. "How are you now?" said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she was
52323. saying.
52324. 
52325. "That, my dear, you must ask the doctor," he replied, and again making
52326. an evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips only (his
52327. words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):
52328. 
52329. "Merci, chere amie, d'etre venue." *
52330. 
52331. 
52332.     * "Thank you for coming, my dear."
52333. 
52334. 
52335. Princess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just
52336. perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She now
52337. understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words, his
52338. tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look could be
52339. felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world, terrible
52340. in one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he understand
52341. anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to understand, not
52342. because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something
52343. else--something the living did not and could not understand--and which
52344. wholly occupied his mind.
52345. 
52346. "There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together," said he,
52347. breaking the silence and pointing to Natasha. "She looks after me all
52348. the time."
52349. 
52350. Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a
52351. thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that,
52352. before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he
52353. could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone. If he had
52354. not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to pity her and
52355. how could he speak like that in her presence? The only explanation was
52356. that he was indifferent, because something else, much more important,
52357. had been revealed to him.
52358. 
52359. The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off.
52360. 
52361. "Mary came by way of Ryazan," said Natasha.
52362. 
52363. Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and only
52364. after calling her so in his presence did Natasha notice it herself.
52365. 
52366. "Really?" he asked.
52367. 
52368. "They told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that..."
52369. 
52370. Natasha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was
52371. making an effort to listen, but could not do so.
52372. 
52373. "Yes, they say it's burned," he said. "It's a great pity," and he gazed
52374. straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his fingers.
52375. 
52376. "And so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?" Prince Andrew suddenly said,
52377. evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. "He wrote here that he
52378. took a great liking to you," he went on simply and calmly, evidently
52379. unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for
52380. living people. "If you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you
52381. to get married," he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having
52382. found words he had long been seeking.
52383. 
52384. Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her, except as
52385. a proof of how far away he now was from everything living.
52386. 
52387. "Why talk of me?" she said quietly and glanced at Natasha.
52388. 
52389. Natasha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again
52390. silent.
52391. 
52392. "Andrew, would you like..." Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling
52393. voice, "would you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking
52394. about you!"
52395. 
52396. Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but
52397. Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did
52398. not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with quiet, gentle
52399. irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last
52400. means of arousing him.
52401. 
52402. "Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?"
52403. 
52404. When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew's room he looked at
52405. his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else
52406. was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to
52407. say to him.
52408. 
52409. When Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to her
52410. brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer began
52411. to cry.
52412. 
52413. He looked at her attentively.
52414. 
52415. "Is it about Nicholas?" he asked.
52416. 
52417. Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping.
52418. 
52419. "Mary, you know the Gosp..." but he broke off.
52420. 
52421. "What did you say?"
52422. 
52423. "Nothing. You mustn't cry here," he said, looking at her with the same
52424. cold expression.
52425. 
52426. 
52427. When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at
52428. the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father. With
52429. a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their
52430. point of view.
52431. 
52432. "Yes, to them it must seem sad!" he thought. "But how simple it is.
52433. 
52434. "The fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father
52435. feedeth them," he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary;
52436. "but no, they will take it their own way, they won't understand!
52437. They can't understand that all those feelings they prize so--all our
52438. feelings, all those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary.
52439. We cannot understand one another," and he remained silent.
52440. 
52441. 
52442. Prince Andrew's little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and knew
52443. nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining knowledge,
52444. observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the faculties he
52445. afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or more profound
52446. understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between
52447. his father, Mary, and Natasha, than he had then. He understood it
52448. completely, and, leaving the room without crying, went silently up
52449. to Natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his
52450. beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled
52451. and leaning his head against her he began to cry.
52452. 
52453. After that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him and
52454. either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Natasha of whom
52455. he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them quietly and
52456. shyly.
52457. 
52458. When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what
52459. Natasha's face had told her. She did not speak any more to Natasha of
52460. hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside his sofa, and
52461. did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in soul to that
52462. Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the dying man was now so
52463. evident.
52464. 
52465. 
52466. 
52467. 
52468. 
52469. CHAPTER XVI
52470. 
52471. 
52472. Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he was
52473. dying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an aloofness from
52474. everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence.
52475. Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming. That inexorable,
52476. eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which he had felt
52477. continually all his life--was now near to him and, by the strange
52478. lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable...
52479. 
52480. 
52481. Formerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that terribly
52482. tormenting fear of death--the end--but now he no longer understood that
52483. fear.
52484. 
52485.  He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top
52486. before him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky,
52487. and knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to himself
52488. after being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love had
52489. instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of
52490. life that had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased to
52491. think about it.
52492. 
52493. During the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he
52494. spent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new
52495. principle of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously
52496. detached himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody and
52497. always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not
52498. to live this earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that
52499. principle of love, the more he renounced life and the more completely
52500. he destroyed that dreadful barrier which--in the absence of such
52501. love--stands between life and death. When during those first days he
52502. remembered that he would have to die, he said to himself: "Well, what of
52503. it? So much the better!"
52504. 
52505. But after the night in Mytishchi when, half delirious, he had seen her
52506. for whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her hand to his
52507. lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a particular woman again
52508. crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life. And
52509. joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind. Recalling the
52510. moment at the ambulance station when he had seen Kuragin, he could not
52511. now regain the feeling he then had, but was tormented by the question
52512. whether Kuragin was alive. And he dared not inquire.
52513. 
52514. His illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Natasha
52515. referred to when she said: "This suddenly happened," had occurred two
52516. days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual struggle
52517. between life and death, in which death gained the victory. It was
52518. the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as
52519. presented to him in the form of his love for Natasha, and a last, though
52520. ultimately vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.
52521. 
52522. It was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish, and his
52523. thoughts were preternaturally clear. Sonya was sitting by the table. He
52524. began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him.
52525. 
52526. "Ah, she has come!" thought he.
52527. 
52528. And so it was: in Sonya's place sat Natasha who had just come in
52529. noiselessly.
52530. 
52531. Since she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced this
52532. physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair
52533. placed sideways, screening the light of the candle from him, and was
52534. knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings since Prince
52535. Andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old
52536. nurses who knit stockings, and that there is something soothing in
52537. the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked lightly in her slender,
52538. rapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile
52539. of her drooping face. She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees. She
52540. started, glanced round at him, and screening the candle with her hand
52541. stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement, picked up the ball,
52542. and regained her former position.
52543. 
52544. He looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a
52545. deep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed
52546. cautiously.
52547. 
52548. At the Troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had told
52549. her that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had
52550. brought them together again, but after that they never spoke of the
52551. future.
52552. 
52553. "Can it or can it not be?" he now thought as he looked at her and
52554. listened to the light click of the steel needles. "Can fate have brought
52555. me to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible that the
52556. truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent
52557. my life in falsity? I love her more than anything in the world! But what
52558. am I to do if I love her?" he thought, and he involuntarily groaned,
52559. from a habit acquired during his sufferings.
52560. 
52561. On hearing that sound Natasha put down the stocking, leaned nearer to
52562. him, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to him
52563. and bent over him.
52564. 
52565. "You are not asleep?"
52566. 
52567. "No, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in. No one
52568. else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do... that light.
52569. I want to weep for joy."
52570. 
52571. Natasha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.
52572. 
52573. "Natasha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world."
52574. 
52575. "And I!"--She turned away for an instant. "Why too much?" she asked.
52576. 
52577. "Why too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your soul, your
52578. whole soul--shall I live? What do you think?"
52579. 
52580. "I am sure of it, sure!" Natasha almost shouted, taking hold of both his
52581. hands with a passionate movement.
52582. 
52583. He remained silent awhile.
52584. 
52585. "How good it would be!" and taking her hand he kissed it.
52586. 
52587. Natasha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this would
52588. not do and that he had to be quiet.
52589. 
52590. "But you have not slept," she said, repressing her joy. "Try to sleep...
52591. please!"
52592. 
52593. He pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and
52594. sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked at
52595. him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her
52596. stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.
52597. 
52598. Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and
52599. suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.
52600. 
52601. As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now
52602. always occupied his mind--about life and death, and chiefly about death.
52603. He felt himself nearer to it.
52604. 
52605. "Love? What is love?" he thought.
52606. 
52607. "Love hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I
52608. understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only
52609. because I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to
52610. die means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and
52611. eternal source." These thoughts seemed to him comforting. But they were
52612. only thoughts. Something was lacking in them, they were not clear, they
52613. were too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former
52614. agitation and obscurity. He fell asleep.
52615. 
52616. He dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but that
52617. he was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and
52618. insignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them and
52619. discussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere.
52620. Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had
52621. more important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by
52622. empty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to
52623. disappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded
52624. all else. He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. Everything
52625. depended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it. He went, and
52626. tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be
52627. in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers. He
52628. was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the fear of death. It
52629. stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward
52630. the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing
52631. against it and forcing its way in. Something not human--death--was
52632. breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the
52633. door, making a final effort to hold it back--to lock it was no longer
52634. possible--but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from
52635. behind by that terror, opened and closed again.
52636. 
52637. Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain
52638. and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was
52639. death, and Prince Andrew died.
52640. 
52641. But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep,
52642. and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke.
52643. 
52644. "Yes, it was death! I died--and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!"
52645. And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till
52646. then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt
52647. as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that
52648. strange lightness did not again leave him.
52649. 
52650. When, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, Natasha went
52651. up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked at
52652. her strangely, not understanding.
52653. 
52654. That was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary's
52655. arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever
52656. assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest
52657. Natasha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more
52658. convincing.
52659. 
52660. From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with
52661. his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration of life it did
52662. not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the
52663. duration of a dream.
52664. 
52665. There was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow
52666. awakening.
52667. 
52668. His last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both
52669. Princess Mary and Natasha, who did not leave him, felt this. They did
52670. not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt
52671. that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he had left
52672. them) but on what reminded them most closely of him--his body. Both felt
52673. this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not
52674. affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief.
52675. Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep, nor did they ever
52676. talk to one another about him. They felt that they could not express in
52677. words what they understood.
52678. 
52679. They both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and deeper,
52680. away from them, and they both knew that this had to be so and that it
52681. was right.
52682. 
52683. He confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of
52684. him. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the boy's
52685. and turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and
52686. Natasha understood that) but simply because he thought it was all that
52687. was required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy, he did
52688. what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was
52689. anything else he should do.
52690. 
52691. When the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,
52692. occurred, Princess Mary and Natasha were present.
52693. 
52694. "Is it over?" said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes
52695. lain motionless, growing cold before them. Natasha went up, looked at
52696. the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but did not
52697. kiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him--his
52698. body.
52699. 
52700. "Where has he gone? Where is he now?..."
52701. 
52702. When the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table,
52703. everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.
52704. 
52705. Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity.
52706. The countess and Sonya cried from pity for Natasha and because he was
52707. no more. The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too,
52708. must take the same terrible step.
52709. 
52710. Natasha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their own
52711. personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which
52712. had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the
52713. simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their
52714. presence.

52726. CHAPTER I
52727. 
52728. 
52729. Man's mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, but
52730. the desire to find those causes is implanted in man's soul. And without
52731. considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one
52732. of which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he snatches at the
52733. first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says:
52734. "This is the cause!" In historical events (where the actions of men are
52735. the subject of observation) the first and most primitive approximation
52736. to present itself was the will of the gods and, after that, the will of
52737. those who stood in the most prominent position--the heroes of history.
52738. But we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event--which
52739. lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it--to
52740. be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the
52741. actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled. It may seem
52742. to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of
52743. historical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference
52744. between a man who says that the people of the West moved on the East
52745. because Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because
52746. it had to happen, as there is between those who declared that the
52747. earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who
52748. admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there
52749. were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets. There
52750. is, and can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of
52751. all causes. But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws
52752. are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend.
52753. The discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite
52754. abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man,
52755. just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was
52756. possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the
52757. earth.
52758. 
52759. The historians consider that, next to the battle of Borodino and the
52760. occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the most
52761. important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the Russian
52762. army from the Ryazana to the Kaluga road and to the Tarutino camp--the
52763. so-called flank march across the Krasnaya Pakhra River. They ascribe the
52764. glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to
52765. whom the honor is due. Even foreign historians, including the French,
52766. acknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders when they speak of
52767. that flank march. But it is hard to understand why military writers,
52768. and following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound
52769. conception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon. In
52770. the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius
52771. of this movement lay, for not much mental effort was needed to see that
52772. the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where
52773. there are most provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have
52774. guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from Moscow
52775. in 1812 was on the Kaluga road. So it is impossible to understand by
52776. what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver
52777. was a profound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why
52778. they think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy
52779. the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded, accompanied,
52780. or followed by other circumstances, might have proved ruinous to the
52781. Russians and salutary for the French. If the position of the Russian
52782. army really began to improve from the time of that march, it does not at
52783. all follow that the march was the cause of it.
52784. 
52785. That flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to
52786. the Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its
52787. destruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If
52788. Murat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained
52789. inactive? If the Russian army at Krasnaya Pakhra had given battle as
52790. Bennigsen and Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French
52791. attacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the Pakhra? What
52792. would have happened if on approaching Tarutino, Napoleon had attacked
52793. the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he
52794. attacked them at Smolensk? What would have happened had the French moved
52795. on Petersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank march that
52796. brought salvation might have proved disastrous.
52797. 
52798. The third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying
52799. history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be
52800. attributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in
52801. reality, like the retreat from Fili, it did not suggest itself to anyone
52802. in its entirety, but resulted--moment by moment, step by step, event by
52803. event--from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only
52804. seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the
52805. past.
52806. 
52807. At the council at Fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the
52808. Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a
52809. direct retreat by the Nizhni road. In proof of this there is the fact
52810. that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and above
52811. all there is the well-known conversation after the council, between the
52812. commander in chief and Lanskoy, who was in charge of the commissariat
52813. department. Lanskoy informed the commander in chief that the army
52814. supplies were for the most part stored along the Oka in the Tula and
52815. Ryazan provinces, and that if they retreated on Nizhni the army would
52816. be separated from its supplies by the broad river Oka, which cannot be
52817. crossed early in winter. This was the first indication of the necessity
52818. of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course--a
52819. direct retreat on Nizhni-Novgorod. The army turned more to the south,
52820. along the Ryazan road and nearer to its supplies. Subsequently the
52821. inactivity of the French (who even lost sight of the Russian army),
52822. concern for the safety of the arsenal at Tula, and especially the
52823. advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn
52824. still further south to the Tula road. Having crossed over, by a forced
52825. march, to the Tula road beyond the Pakhra, the Russian commanders
52826. intended to remain at Podolsk and had no thought of the Tarutino
52827. position; but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of French
52828. troops who had for a time lost touch with the Russians, and projects
52829. of giving battle, and above all the abundance of provisions in Kaluga
52830. province, obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross
52831. from the Tula to the Kaluga road and go to Tarutino, which was between
52832. the roads along which those supplies lay. Just as it is impossible to
52833. say when it was decided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say
52834. precisely when, or by whom, it was decided to move to Tarutino. Only
52835. when the army had got there, as the result of innumerable and varying
52836. forces, did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this
52837. movement and long ago foreseen its result.
52838. 
52839. 
52840. 
52841. 
52842. 
52843. CHAPTER II
52844. 
52845. 
52846. The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance
52847. of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually
52848. retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct
52849. course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the
52850. district where supplies were abundant.
52851. 
52852. If instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the
52853. Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could not
52854. have done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow, describing
52855. an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where
52856. the country was richest.
52857. 
52858. That movement from the Nizhni to the Ryazan, Tula, and Kaluga roads was
52859. so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and
52860. demands were sent from Petersburg for Kutuzov to take his army that
52861. way. At Tarutino Kutuzov received what was almost a reprimand from
52862. the Emperor for having moved his army along the Ryazan road, and the
52863. Emperor's letter indicated to him the very position he had already
52864. occupied near Kaluga.
52865. 
52866. Having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the
52867. whole campaign and by the battle of Borodino, the Russian army--when
52868. the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was
52869. received--assumed the position natural to it.
52870. 
52871. Kutuzov's merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as it is
52872. called, but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of
52873. what had happened. He alone then understood the meaning of the French
52874. army's inactivity, he alone continued to assert that the battle of
52875. Borodino had been a victory, he alone--who as commander in chief might
52876. have been expected to be eager to attack--employed his whole strength to
52877. restrain the Russian army from useless engagements.
52878. 
52879. The beast wounded at Borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had
52880. left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and
52881. merely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was heard
52882. to moan.
52883. 
52884. The moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed its
52885. calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kutuzov's camp with
52886. overtures for peace.
52887. 
52888. Napoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was
52889. right, wrote to Kutuzov the first words that occurred to him, though
52890. they were meaningless.
52891. 
52892. 
52893. MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my adjutants-general
52894. to discuss several interesting questions with you. I beg your Highness
52895. to credit what he says to you, especially when he expresses the
52896. sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long entertained for your
52897. person. This letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le
52898. Prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious protection!
52899. 
52900. NAPOLEON

52903. 
52904. 
52905. Kutuzov replied: "I should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as
52906. the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit
52907. of my nation." But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his
52908. troops from attacking.
52909. 
52910. During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and
52911. the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tarutino, a change had taken
52912. place in the relative strength of the two armies--both in spirit and in
52913. number--as a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian
52914. side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown
52915. to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking
52916. at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauriston's
52917. mission; the abundance of provisions at Tarutino; the reports coming in
52918. from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of
52919. recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian
52920. soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been
52921. assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been
52922. resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of,
52923. was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to
52924. the French stationed at Tarutino; the news of easy successes gained by
52925. peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this;
52926. the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as
52927. the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every
52928. soldier's mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and
52929. that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial change
52930. in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable. And at
52931. once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand
52932. has completed a full circle, this change was shown by an increased
52933. activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.
52934. 
52935. 
52936. 
52937. 
52938. 
52939. CHAPTER III
52940. 
52941. 
52942. The Russian army was commanded by Kutuzov and his staff, and also by the
52943. Emperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment of Moscow
52944. had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole campaign
52945. had been drawn up and sent to Kutuzov for his guidance. Though this plan
52946. had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our hands,
52947. it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action.
52948. Kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always
52949. difficult to execute. So fresh instructions were sent for the solution
52950. of difficulties that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who
52951. were to watch Kutuzov's actions and report upon them.
52952. 
52953. Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized.
52954. The posts left vacant by Bagration, who had been killed, and by
52955. Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled. Very serious
52956. consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to
52957. put A in B's place and B in D's, or on the contrary to put D in A's
52958. place, and so on--as if anything more than A's or B's satisfaction
52959. depended on this.
52960. 
52961. As a result of the hostility between Kutuzov and Bennigsen, his Chief of
52962. Staff, the presence of confidential representatives of the Emperor, and
52963. these transfers, a more than usually complicated play of parties
52964. was going on among the staff of the army. A was undermining B, D was
52965. undermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and permutations.
52966. In all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct
52967. of the war, which all these men believed they were directing; but this
52968. affair of the war went on independently of them, as it had to go:
52969. that is, never in the way people devised, but flowing always from the
52970. essential attitude of the masses. Only in the highest spheres did
52971. all these schemes, crossings, and interminglings appear to be a true
52972. reflection of what had to happen.
52973. 
52974. 
52975. Prince Michael Ilarionovich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of October
52976. in a letter that reached Kutuzov after the battle at Tarutino) Since
52977. September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last reports
52978. were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not only has
52979. no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient
52980. capital, but according to your last report you have even retreated
52981. farther. Serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and Tula
52982. with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army, is in danger.
52983. From General Wintzingerode's reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten
52984. thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several
52985. thousand men is moving on Dmitrov. A third has advanced along the
52986. Vladimir road, and a fourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed
52987. between Ruza and Mozhaysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as
52988. the twenty-fifth. In view of all this information, when the enemy has
52989. scattered his forces in large detachments, and with Napoleon and his
52990. Guards in Moscow, is it possible that the enemy's forces confronting you
52991. are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the
52992. contrary, he is probably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with
52993. an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem
52994. that, availing yourself of these circumstances, you might advantageously
52995. attack a weaker one and annihilate him, or at least oblige him to
52996. retreat, retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now
52997. occupied by the enemy, and thereby averting danger from Tula and other
52998. towns in the interior. You will be responsible if the enemy is able to
52999. direct a force of any size against Petersburg to threaten this capital
53000. in which it has not been possible to retain many troops; for with the
53001. army entrusted to you, and acting with resolution and energy, you have
53002. ample means to avert this fresh calamity. Remember that you have still
53003. to answer to our offended country for the loss of Moscow. You have
53004. experienced my readiness to reward you. That readiness will not weaken
53005. in me, but I and Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal,
53006. firmness, and success which your intellect, military talent, and the
53007. courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting.
53008. 
53009. 
53010. But by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation of
53011. the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched,
53012. Kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he
53013. commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.
53014. 
53015. On the second of October a Cossack, Shapovalov, who was out scouting,
53016. killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded hare he made
53017. his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Murat's
53018. army, encamped there without any precautions. The Cossack laughingly
53019. told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the French.
53020. A cornet, hearing the story, informed his commander.
53021. 
53022. The Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished
53023. to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of
53024. the superior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities,
53025. reported the incident to a general on the staff. The state of things on
53026. the staff had of late been exceedingly strained. Ermolov had been to
53027. see Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use
53028. his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the
53029. offensive.
53030. 
53031. "If I did not know you I should think you did not want what you are
53032. asking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure to do
53033. the opposite," replied Bennigsen.
53034. 
53035. The Cossack's report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out, was
53036. the final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled spring was
53037. released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play. Despite all
53038. his supposed power, his intellect, his experience, and his knowledge of
53039. men, Kutuzov--having taken into consideration the Cossack's report, a
53040. note from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to the Emperor, the wishes
53041. he supposed the Emperor to hold, and the fact that all the generals
53042. expressed the same wish--could no longer check the inevitable movement,
53043. and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful--gave
53044. his approval, that is, to the accomplished fact.
53045. 
53046. 
53047. 
53048. 
53049. 
53050. CHAPTER IV
53051. 
53052. 
53053. Bennigsen's note and the Cossack's information that the left flank
53054. of the French was unguarded were merely final indications that it was
53055. necessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of October.
53056. 
53057. On the morning of the fourth of October Kutuzov signed the dispositions.
53058. Toll read them to Ermolov, asking him to attend to the further
53059. arrangements.
53060. 
53061. "All right--all right. I haven't time just now," replied Ermolov, and
53062. left the hut.
53063. 
53064. The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the Austerlitz
53065. dispositions, it was written--though not in German this time:
53066. 
53067. "The First Column will march here and here," "the Second Column will
53068. march there and there," and so on; and on paper, all these columns
53069. arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy.
53070. Everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions,
53071. and as is always the case, not a single column reached its place at the
53072. appointed time.
53073. 
53074. When the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been
53075. prepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to Ermolov
53076. to deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, Kutuzov's orderly,
53077. pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him, went to
53078. Ermolov's quarters.
53079. 
53080. "Gone away," said Ermolov's orderly.
53081. 
53082. The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom Ermolov was
53083. often to be found.
53084. 
53085. "No, and the general's out too."
53086. 
53087. The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.
53088. 
53089. "No, he's gone out."
53090. 
53091. "If only they don't make me responsible for this delay! What a nuisance
53092. it is!" thought the officer, and he rode round the whole camp. One man
53093. said he had seen Ermolov ride past with some other generals, others said
53094. he must have returned home. The officer searched till six o'clock in the
53095. evening without even stopping to eat. Ermolov was nowhere to be found
53096. and no one knew where he was. The officer snatched a little food at
53097. a comrade's, and rode again to the vanguard to find Miloradovich.
53098. Miloradovich too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a
53099. ball at General Kikin's and that Ermolov was probably there too.
53100. 
53101. "But where is it?"
53102. 
53103. "Why, there, over at Echkino," said a Cossack officer, pointing to a
53104. country house in the far distance.
53105. 
53106. "What, outside our line?"
53107. 
53108. "They've put two regiments as outposts, and they're having such a spree
53109. there, it's awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!"
53110. 
53111. The officer rode out beyond our lines to Echkino. While still at a
53112. distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier's dance song
53113. proceeding from the house.
53114. 
53115. "In the meadows... in the meadows!" he heard, accompanied by whistling
53116. and the sound of a torban, drowned every now and then by shouts. These
53117. sounds made his spirits rise, but at the same time he was afraid that
53118. he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order
53119. entrusted to him. It was already past eight o'clock. He dismounted
53120. and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained
53121. intact between the Russian and French forces. In the refreshment room
53122. and the hall, footmen were bustling about with wine and viands. Groups
53123. of singers stood outside the windows. The officer was admitted and
53124. immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together, and among
53125. them Ermolov's big imposing figure. They all had their coats unbuttoned
53126. and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces,
53127. laughing loudly. In the middle of the room a short handsome general with
53128. a red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agility.
53129. 
53130. "Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Ivanych! Ha, ha, ha!"
53131. 
53132. The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment
53133. he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait; but one of
53134. the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come about, informed
53135. Ermolov.
53136. 
53137. Ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what the
53138. officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.
53139. 
53140. 
53141. "You think he went off just by chance?" said a comrade, who was on the
53142. staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to
53143. Ermolov. "It was a trick. It was done on purpose to get Konovnitsyn into
53144. trouble. You'll see what a mess there'll be tomorrow."
53145. 
53146. 
53147. 
53148. 
53149. 
53150. CHAPTER V
53151. 
53152. 
53153. Next day the decrepit Kutuzov, having given orders to be called early,
53154. said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness of
53155. having to direct a battle he did not approve of, got into his caleche
53156. and drove from Letashovka (a village three and a half miles from
53157. Tarutino) to the place where the attacking columns were to meet. He sat
53158. in the caleche, dozing and waking up by turns, and listening for any
53159. sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun.
53160. But all was still quiet. A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning. On
53161. approaching Tarutino Kutuzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to
53162. water across the road along which he was driving. Kutuzov looked at
53163. them searchingly, stopped his carriage, and inquired what regiment they
53164. belonged to. They belonged to a column that should have been far in
53165. front and in ambush long before then. "It may be a mistake," thought
53166. the old commander in chief. But a little further on he saw infantry
53167. regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers, only partly dressed,
53168. eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The
53169. officer reported that no order to advance had been received.
53170. 
53171. "How! Not rec..." Kutuzov began, but checked himself immediately and
53172. sent for a senior officer. Getting out of his caleche, he waited with
53173. drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down. When
53174. Eykhen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared,
53175. Kutuzov went purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame
53176. for the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient importance
53177. for him to vent his wrath on. Trembling and panting the old man fell
53178. into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the
53179. ground, and he fell upon Eykhen, threatening him with his hands,
53180. shouting and loading him with gross abuse. Another man, Captain Brozin,
53181. who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame, suffered the
53182. same fate.
53183. 
53184. "What sort of another blackguard are you? I'll have you shot!
53185. Scoundrels!" yelled Kutuzov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and
53186. reeling.
53187. 
53188. He was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a Serene
53189. Highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had
53190. in Russia, to be placed in this position--made the laughingstock of the
53191. whole army! "I needn't have been in such a hurry to pray about today,
53192. or have kept awake thinking everything over all night," thought he to
53193. himself. "When I was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to
53194. mock me so... and now!" He was in a state of physical suffering as if
53195. from corporal punishment, and could not avoid expressing it by cries of
53196. anger and distress. But his strength soon began to fail him, and looking
53197. about him, conscious of having said much that was amiss, he again got
53198. into his caleche and drove back in silence.
53199. 
53200. His wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he
53201. listened to excuses and self-justifications (Ermolov did not come to see
53202. him till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen, Konovnitsyn,
53203. and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next
53204. day. And once more Kutuzov had to consent.
53205. 
53206. 
53207. 
53208. 
53209. 
53210. CHAPTER VI
53211. 
53212. 
53213. Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening
53214. and advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with dark purple
53215. clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops
53216. advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the artillery
53217. could be faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk out loud, to
53218. smoke their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried to prevent their
53219. horses neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm
53220. and they marched gaily. Some columns, supposing they had reached their
53221. destination, halted, piled arms, and settled down on the cold ground,
53222. but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they
53223. evidently should not have been.
53224. 
53225. Only Count Orlov-Denisov with his Cossacks (the least important
53226. detachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time. This
53227. detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path leading from
53228. the village of Stromilova to Dmitrovsk.
53229. 
53230. Toward dawn, Count Orlov-Denisov, who had dozed off, was awakened by a
53231. deserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a Polish
53232. sergeant of Poniatowski's corps, who explained in Polish that he had
53233. come over because he had been slighted in the service: that he ought
53234. long ago to have been made an officer, that he was braver than any of
53235. them, and so he had left them and wished to pay them out. He said that
53236. Murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were,
53237. and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would
53238. capture him alive. Count Orlov-Denisov consulted his fellow officers.
53239. 
53240. The offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go and
53241. everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and arguing,
53242. Major-General Grekov with two Cossack regiments decided to go with the
53243. Polish sergeant.
53244. 
53245. "Now, remember," said Count Orlov-Denisov to the sergeant at parting,
53246. "if you have been lying I'll have you hanged like a dog; but if it's
53247. true you shall have a hundred gold pieces!"
53248. 
53249. Without replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and rode
53250. away with Grekov whose men had quickly assembled. They disappeared into
53251. the forest, and Count Orlov-Denisov, having seen Grekov off, returned,
53252. shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he
53253. had undertaken on his own responsibility, and began looking at the enemy
53254. camp, now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying
53255. campfires. Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open
53256. declivity to his right. He looked in that direction, but though the
53257. columns would have been visible quite far off, they were not to be seen.
53258. It seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the French
53259. camp, and his keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this.
53260. 
53261. "Oh, it is really too late," said Count Orlov, looking at the camp.
53262. 
53263. As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before
53264. our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the
53265. sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian
53266. attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which
53267. he would lead away heaven only knew where. How could one capture a
53268. commander in chief from among such a mass of troops!
53269. 
53270. "I am sure that rascal was lying," said the count.
53271. 
53272. "They can still be called back," said one of his suite, who like Count
53273. Orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemy's
53274. camp.
53275. 
53276. "Eh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?"
53277. 
53278. "Will you have them fetched back?"
53279. 
53280. "Fetch them back, fetch them back!" said Count Orlov with sudden
53281. determination, looking at his watch. "It will be too late. It is quite
53282. light."
53283. 
53284. And the adjutant galloped through the forest after Grekov. When Grekov
53285. returned, Count Orlov-Denisov, excited both by the abandoned attempt and
53286. by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear, as
53287. well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance. All his men
53288. felt the same excitement.
53289. 
53290. "Mount!" he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and
53291. crossed themselves.... "Forward, with God's aid!"
53292. 
53293. "Hurrah-ah-ah!" reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack companies,
53294. trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out
53295. of a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.
53296. 
53297. One desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw the
53298. Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just waking
53299. up, ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and horses.
53300. 
53301. Had the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind and
53302. around them, they would have captured Murat and everything there.
53303. That was what the officers desired. But it was impossible to make the
53304. Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners. None of them
53305. listened to orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were
53306. taken on the spot, besides standards and (what seemed most important to
53307. the Cossacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like. All this had
53308. to be dealt with, the prisoners and guns secured, the booty divided--not
53309. without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselves--and
53310. it was on this that the Cossacks all busied themselves.
53311. 
53312. The French, not being farther pursued, began to recover themselves: they
53313. formed into detachments and began firing. Orlov-Denisov, still waiting
53314. for the other columns to arrive, advanced no further.
53315. 
53316. Meantime, according to the dispositions which said that "the First
53317. Column will march" and so on, the infantry of the belated columns,
53318. commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due order
53319. and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their appointed
53320. places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully, began to halt;
53321. murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and finally a
53322. backward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about, shouted, grew
53323. angry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and were late, gave
53324. vent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and went forward,
53325. simply to get somewhere. "We shall get somewhere or other!" And they did
53326. indeed get somewhere, though not to their right places; a few eventually
53327. even got to their right place, but too late to be of any use and only
53328. in time to be fired at. Toll, who in this battle played the part of
53329. Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped assiduously from place to place,
53330. finding everything upside down everywhere. Thus he stumbled on Bagovut's
53331. corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight, though the corps
53332. should long before have joined Orlov-Denisov. Excited and vexed by the
53333. failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it, Toll
53334. galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him
53335. severely, saying that he ought to be shot. General Bagovut, a fighting
53336. old soldier of placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay,
53337. confusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody's surprise
53338. and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things
53339. to Toll.
53340. 
53341. "I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as
53342. well as anybody," he said, and advanced with a single division.
53343. 
53344. Coming out onto a field under the enemy's fire, this brave general went
53345. straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering in his
53346. agitation whether going into action now, with a single division, would
53347. be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he
53348. needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets killed him, and other
53349. bullets killed many of his men. And his division remained under fire for
53350. some time quite uselessly.
53351. 
53352. 
53353. 
53354. 
53355. 
53356. CHAPTER VII
53357. 
53358. 
53359. Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the front,
53360. but Kutuzov accompanied that column. He well knew that nothing but
53361. confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will, and as
53362. far as was in his power held the troops back. He did not advance.
53363. 
53364. He rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering
53365. suggestions that they should attack.
53366. 
53367. "The word attack is always on your tongue, but you don't see that we are
53368. unable to execute complicated maneuvers," said he to Miloradovich who
53369. asked permission to advance.
53370. 
53371. "We couldn't take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in
53372. time, and nothing can be done now!" he replied to someone else.
53373. 
53374. When Kutuzov was informed that at the French rear--where according to
53375. the reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody--there were
53376. now two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at Ermolov who
53377. was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day.
53378. 
53379. "You see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds,
53380. but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy,
53381. forewarned, takes measures accordingly."
53382. 
53383. Ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words.
53384. He understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that Kutuzov
53385. would content himself with that hint.
53386. 
53387. "He's having a little fun at my expense," said Ermolov softly, nudging
53388. with his knee Raevski who was at his side.
53389. 
53390. Soon after this, Ermolov moved up to Kutuzov and respectfully remarked:
53391. 
53392. "It is not too late yet, your Highness--the enemy has not gone away--if
53393. you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as see
53394. a little smoke."
53395. 
53396. Kutuzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Murat's troops
53397. were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every hundred paces he
53398. halted for three quarters of an hour.
53399. 
53400. The whole battle consisted in what Orlov-Denisov's Cossacks had done:
53401. the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.
53402. 
53403. In consequence of this battle Kutuzov received a diamond decoration,
53404. and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also
53405. received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades,
53406. and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.
53407. 
53408. "That's how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!" said the
53409. Russian officers and generals after the Tarutino battle, letting it be
53410. understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that
53411. we ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today. But
53412. people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about
53413. or deliberately deceive themselves. No battle--Tarutino, Borodino, or
53414. Austerlitz--takes place as those who planned it anticipated. That is an
53415. essential condition.
53416. 
53417. A countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than during
53418. a battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence the course
53419. taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in advance and
53420. never coincides with the direction of any one force.
53421. 
53422. If many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given
53423. body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those
53424. forces, but will always be a mean--what in mechanics is represented by
53425. the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.
53426. 
53427. If in the descriptions given by historians, especially French ones, we
53428. find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously
53429. formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions
53430. are false.
53431. 
53432. The battle of Tarutino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in
53433. view--to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the
53434. dispositions; nor that which Count Orlov-Denisov may have had in
53435. view--to take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying
53436. the whole corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor
53437. the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish
53438. himself; nor that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got, and
53439. so on. But if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what
53440. all the Russians of that day desired--to drive the French out of Russia
53441. and destroy their army--it is quite clear that the battle of Tarutino,
53442. just because of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that
53443. stage of the campaign. It would be difficult and even impossible to
53444. imagine any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this
53445. battle. With a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the
53446. greatest confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign
53447. were attained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of
53448. the weakness of the French, and the administration of that shock which
53449. Napoleon's army had only awaited to begin its flight.
53450. 
53451. 
53452. 
53453. 
53454. 
53455. CHAPTER VIII
53456. 
53457. 
53458. Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there
53459. can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the
53460. hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient
53461. capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and
53462. incalculable wealth, is in Napoleon's hands. The Russian army, only half
53463. the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to attack for
53464. a whole month. Napoleon's position is most brilliant. He can either fall
53465. on the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate
53466. an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on
53467. Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to Smolensk or
53468. Vilna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be
53469. required to retain the brilliant position the French held at that time.
53470. For that, only very simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow
53471. the troops to loot, to prepare winter clothing--of which there was
53472. sufficient in Moscow for the whole army--and methodically to collect
53473. the provisions, of which (according to the French historians) there were
53474. enough in Moscow to supply the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon,
53475. that greatest of all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of
53476. the army, took none of these steps.
53477. 
53478. He not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his
53479. power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open
53480. to him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in Moscow,
53481. advancing on Petersburg or on Nizhni-Novgorod, or retiring by a more
53482. northerly or more southerly route (say by the road Kutuzov afterwards
53483. took), nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he
53484. actually did. He remained in Moscow till October, letting the troops
53485. plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind
53486. him, he quitted Moscow, approached Kutuzov without joining battle,
53487. turned to the right and reached Malo-Yaroslavets, again without
53488. attempting to break through and take the road Kutuzov took, but retiring
53489. instead to Mozhaysk along the devastated Smolensk road. Nothing more
53490. stupid than that could have been devised, or more disastrous for the
53491. army, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleon's aim been to destroy his army,
53492. the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series
53493. of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose,
53494. independently of anything the Russian army might do.
53495. 
53496. Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his
53497. army because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as
53498. unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he
53499. wished to and because he was very clever and a genius.
53500. 
53501. In both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the
53502. personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that
53503. guided the event.
53504. 
53505. The historians quite falsely represent Napoleon's faculties as having
53506. weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify
53507. his actions. He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he
53508. could for himself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did
53509. subsequently in 1813. His activity at that time was no less astounding
53510. than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia. We do not
53511. know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in Egypt--where forty
53512. centuries looked down upon his grandeur--for his great exploits there
53513. are all told us by Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius
53514. in Austria or Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French
53515. or German sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps
53516. without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans
53517. to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on
53518. in Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius
53519. in order to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the
53520. matter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.
53521. 
53522. His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as
53523. elsewhere. Order after order and plan after plan were issued by him
53524. from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The absence
53525. of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of Moscow, did not
53526. disconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his
53527. army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the people
53528. of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic
53529. considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace.
53530. 
53531. 
53532. 
53533. 
53534. 
53535. CHAPTER IX
53536. 
53537. 
53538. With regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry into
53539. Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements
53540. of the Russian army, sent army corps out along the different roads, and
53541. charged Murat to find Kutuzov. Then he gave careful directions about the
53542. fortification of the Kremlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future
53543. campaign over the whole map of Russia.
53544. 
53545. With regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain Yakovlev,
53546. who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of
53547. Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity,
53548. and having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in which he
53549. considered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that Rostopchin
53550. had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he dispatched Yakovlev to
53551. Petersburg.
53552. 
53553. Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tutolmin, he
53554. dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.
53555. 
53556. With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders
53557. to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Rostopchin was
53558. punished by an order to burn down his houses.
53559. 
53560. With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a
53561. constitution. A municipality was established and the following
53562. announcement issued:
53563. 
53564. 
53565. INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!
53566. 
53567. Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King
53568. desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he
53569. punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to
53570. put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A
53571. paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your
53572. municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your
53573. needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red
53574. ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear
53575. a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red
53576. ribbon round the left arm.
53577. 
53578. The city police is established on its former footing, and better order
53579. already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has
53580. appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty
53581. commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different
53582. wards of the city. You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will
53583. wear on the left arm. Several churches of different denominations are
53584. open, and divine service is performed in them unhindered. Your fellow
53585. citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been
53586. given that they should find in them the help and protection due to
53587. their misfortunes. These are the measures the government has adopted to
53588. re-establish order and relieve your condition. But to achieve this
53589. aim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should, if
53590. possible, forget the misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain
53591. the hope of a less cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and
53592. ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or
53593. on what remains of your property, and finally that you should not doubt
53594. that these will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest
53595. and most just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you
53596. may be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of
53597. a state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to
53598. another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the
53599. military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow!
53600. 
53601. 
53602. With regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all the
53603. troops in turn should enter Moscow a la maraude * to obtain provisions
53604. for themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for.
53605. 
53606. 
53607.     * As looters.
53608. 
53609. 
53610. With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back
53611. and services to be again performed in the churches.
53612. 
53613. With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was
53614. placarded everywhere:
53615. 
53616. 
53617. PROCLAMATION!
53618. 
53619. You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom
53620. misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of
53621. the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!
53622. Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in
53623. it. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places
53624. on finding that they are respected. Any violence to them or to their
53625. property is promptly punished. His Majesty the Emperor and King protects
53626. them, and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey
53627. his orders. He desires to end your misfortunes and restore you to your
53628. homes and families. Respond, therefore, to his benevolent intentions
53629. and come to us without fear. Inhabitants, return with confidence to your
53630. abodes! You will soon find means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen
53631. and industrious artisans, return to your work, your houses, your shops,
53632. where the protection of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper pay
53633. for your work. And lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where
53634. you are hiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full
53635. assurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in the
53636. city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of
53637. the soil. The government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom
53638. of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants, husbandmen, and those
53639. living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger bring their
53640. supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets, of which one is on
53641. the Mokhovaya Street and the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such
53642. supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may
53643. agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be
53644. free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him
53645. under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday of each week are appointed
53646. as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops
53647. will be stationed along the highroads on Tuesdays and Saturdays at such
53648. distances from the town as to protect the carts. (4) Similar measures
53649. will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no
53650. hindrance on their return journey. (5) Steps will immediately be taken
53651. to re-establish ordinary trading.
53652. 
53653. Inhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and artisans,
53654. to whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry out the
53655. paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to
53656. co-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and
53657. confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!
53658. 
53659. 
53660. With the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people,
53661. reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The Emperor
53662. rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his
53663. preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were
53664. established by his order.
53665. 
53666. In regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads,
53667. Napoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma
53668. Mere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining
53669. tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He
53670. visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him
53671. to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with Tutolmin. Then, as
53672. Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged
53673. Russian money which he had prepared: "Raising the use of these means
53674. by an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let relief
53675. be distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food was too
53676. precious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part enemies,
53677. Napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food
53678. from outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them."
53679. 
53680. With reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued
53681. to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties
53682. and to suppress robbery.
53683. 
53684. 
53685. 
53686. 
53687. 
53688. CHAPTER X
53689. 
53690. 
53691. But strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans--which were
53692. not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances--did not
53693. affect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock detached
53694. from the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without
53695. engaging the cogwheels.
53696. 
53697. With reference to the military side--the plan of campaign--that work of
53698. genius of which Thiers remarks that, "His genius never devised anything
53699. more profound, more skillful, or more admirable," and enters into a
53700. polemic with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred
53701. not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of October--that plan never was
53702. or could be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the facts
53703. of the case. The fortifying of the Kremlin, for which la Mosquee (as
53704. Napoleon termed the church of Basil the Beatified) was to have been
53705. razed to the ground, proved quite useless. The mining of the Kremlin
53706. only helped toward fulfilling Napoleon's wish that it should be blown
53707. up when he left Moscow--as a child wants the floor on which he has
53708. hurt himself to be beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army, about which
53709. Napoleon was so concerned, produced an unheard-of result. The French
53710. generals lost touch with the Russian army of sixty thousand men, and
53711. according to Thiers it was only eventually found, like a lost pin, by
53712. the skill--and apparently the genius--of Murat.
53713. 
53714. With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon's arguments as to his
53715. magnanimity and justice, both to Tutolmin and to Yakovlev (whose chief
53716. concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;
53717. Alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their
53718. embassage.
53719. 
53720. With regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed
53721. incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.
53722. 
53723. With regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a
53724. municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain
53725. people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of
53726. preserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from being
53727. looted.
53728. 
53729. With regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so easily been
53730. settled by Napoleon's visit to a mosque, no results were achieved.
53731. Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out
53732. Napoleon's wish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a French
53733. soldier while conducting service, and a French official reported of
53734. another that: "The priest whom I found and invited to say Mass cleaned
53735. and locked up the church. That night the doors were again broken
53736. open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and other disorders
53737. perpetrated."
53738. 
53739. With reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious workmen and
53740. to peasants evoked no response. There were no industrious workmen, and
53741. the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town
53742. with the proclamation and killed them.
53743. 
53744. As to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,
53745. these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in the
53746. Kremlin and in Posnyakov's house were closed again at once because the
53747. actors and actresses were robbed.
53748. 
53749. Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as
53750. well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The
53751. French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the
53752. paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the
53753. unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.
53754. 
53755. But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given
53756. by the authorities at that time was Napoleon's attempt to stop the
53757. looting and re-establish discipline.
53758. 
53759. This is what the army authorities were reporting:
53760. 
53761. "Looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order
53762. is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a
53763. lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they sell stolen
53764. goods."
53765. 
53766. "The neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of
53767. the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate
53768. inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have
53769. the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly
53770. witnessed."
53771. 
53772. "Nothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and
53773. pillaging--October 9."
53774. 
53775. "Robbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our
53776. district who ought to be arrested by a strong force--October 11."
53777. 
53778. "The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to
53779. stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning
53780. to the Kremlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed
53781. more violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today. The
53782. Emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his
53783. person, who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to
53784. such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army
53785. supplies. Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying
53786. sentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them."
53787. 
53788. "The Grand Marshal of the palace," wrote the governor, "complains
53789. bitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to
53790. commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows
53791. of the Emperor."
53792. 
53793. That army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the
53794. provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated and
53795. perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it did not
53796. go away.
53797. 
53798. It began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the
53799. capture of transport trains on the Smolensk road, and by the battle of
53800. Tarutino. The news of that battle of Tarutino, unexpectedly received
53801. by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians
53802. (Thiers says), and he issued the order for departure which the whole
53803. army was demanding.
53804. 
53805. Fleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had
53806. stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal tresor, but on
53807. seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers says)
53808. horror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not order all
53809. the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with those of a
53810. certain marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the caleches and
53811. carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very
53812. good thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the
53813. sick, and the wounded.
53814. 
53815. The plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which
53816. feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the
53817. skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it
53818. entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps
53819. and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded animal,
53820. hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter's gun, runs forward and
53821. back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his
53822. whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the battle of Tarutino
53823. frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunter's gun,
53824. reached him, turned back, and finally--like any wild beast--ran back
53825. along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent
53826. was familiar.
53827. 
53828. During the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been
53829. the leader of all these movements--as the figurehead of a ship may
53830. seem to a savage to guide the vessel--acted like a child who, holding a
53831. couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.
53832. 
53833. 
53834. 
53835. 
53836. 
53837. CHAPTER XI
53838. 
53839. 
53840. Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the
53841. shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little
53842. blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped about
53843. him. This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside Karataev at
53844. night; it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned
53845. again. Probably it had never had an owner, and it still belonged to
53846. nobody and had no name. The French called it Azor; the soldier who
53847. told stories called it Femgalka; Karataev and others called it Gray, or
53848. sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a name, or even of a breed or
53849. any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in the
53850. least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume, its bandy legs
53851. served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run
53852. very easily and quickly on three legs, as if disdaining to use all
53853. four. Everything pleased it. Now it would roll on its back, yelping with
53854. delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, and
53855. now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.
53856. 
53857. Pierre's attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only
53858. remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier's trousers which by
53859. Karataev's advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and
53860. a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this
53861. time. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of
53862. solidity and strength hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache
53863. covered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested
53864. with lice, curled round his head like a cap. The look of his eyes
53865. was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. The former
53866. slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an
53867. energetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet were bare.
53868. 
53869. Pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen
53870. were passing that morning, then into the distance across the river, then
53871. at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him,
53872. and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various
53873. positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. Every time he looked at his
53874. bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction flitted across his face.
53875. The sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned
53876. during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him.
53877. 
53878. For some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in
53879. the mornings--what is called an "old wives' summer."
53880. 
53881. In the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly
53882. pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in
53883. the air.
53884. 
53885. On everything--far and near--lay the magic crystal glitter seen only
53886. at that time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance,
53887. with the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare trees,
53888. the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church spire,
53889. and the corners of the white house in the distance, all stood out in the
53890. transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness.
53891. Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion
53892. occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green
53893. beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled house--which in
53894. dull weather was repulsively ugly--seemed quietly beautiful now, in the
53895. clear, motionless brilliance.
53896. 
53897. A French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a skullcap on
53898. his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a corner of
53899. the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly wink.
53900. 
53901. "What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!" (Their name for Pierre.) "Eh? Just like
53902. spring!"
53903. 
53904. And the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe,
53905. though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.
53906. 
53907. "To be on the march in such weather..." he began.
53908. 
53909. Pierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told
53910. him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an
53911. order about the prisoners that day. Sokolov, one of the soldiers in the
53912. shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something
53913. should be done about him. The corporal replied that Pierre need not
53914. worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and
53915. arrangements would be made for the sick, and that in general everything
53916. that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities.
53917. 
53918. "Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the captain,
53919. you know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to the captain
53920. when he makes his round, he will do anything for you."
53921. 
53922. (The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre
53923. and showed him all sorts of favors.)
53924. 
53925. "'You see, St. Thomas,' he said to me the other day. 'Monsieur Kiril is
53926. a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has
53927. had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what's what.... If he wants
53928. anything and asks me, he won't get a refusal. When one has studied, you
53929. see, one likes education and well-bred people.' It is for your sake I
53930. mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not been for you
53931. that affair would have ended ill."
53932. 
53933. And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The affair
53934. he had alluded to had happened a few days before--a fight between the
53935. prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had succeeded in
53936. pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre
53937. talking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said.
53938. While Pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving
53939. Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier came up to the door of
53940. the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way
53941. of greeting, he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had
53942. given a shirt to sew was in that shed.
53943. 
53944. A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them,
53945. which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and
53946. shirts for them.
53947. 
53948. "Ready, ready, dear fellow!" said Karataev, coming out with a neatly
53949. folded shirt.
53950. 
53951. Karataev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work,
53952. was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. His
53953. hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast,
53954. and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.
53955. 
53956. "A promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is,
53957. ready," said Platon, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn.
53958. 
53959. The Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his
53960. hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had
53961. a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin bare
53962. body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on
53963. would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly. None
53964. of the prisoners said a word.
53965. 
53966. "See, it fits well!" Platon kept repeating, pulling the shirt straight.
53967. 
53968. The Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without raising
53969. his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.
53970. 
53971. "You see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper
53972. tools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse," said
53973. Platon with one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his work.
53974. 
53975. "It's good, quite good, thank you," said the Frenchman, in French, "but
53976. there must be some linen left over.
53977. 
53978. "It will fit better still when it sets to your body," said Karataev,
53979. still admiring his handiwork. "You'll be nice and comfortable...."
53980. 
53981. "Thanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?" said the
53982. Frenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note and
53983. gave it to Karataev. "But give me the pieces that are over."
53984. 
53985. Pierre saw that Platon did not want to understand what the Frenchman
53986. was saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karataev thanked the
53987. Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The Frenchman
53988. insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked
53989. Pierre to translate what he said.
53990. 
53991. "What does he want the bits for?" said Karataev. "They'd make fine leg
53992. bands for us. Well, never mind."
53993. 
53994. And Karataev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, took
53995. a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the
53996. Frenchman without looking at him. "Oh dear!" muttered Karataev and went
53997. away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then
53998. looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre's look had told him
53999. something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:
54000. 
54001. "Platoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!" And handing back the odd
54002. bits he turned and went out.
54003. 
54004. "There, look at that," said Karataev, swaying his head. "People said
54005. they were not Christians, but they too have souls. It's what the old
54006. folk used to say: 'A sweating hand's an open hand, a dry hand's close.'
54007. He's naked, but yet he's given it back."
54008. 
54009. Karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the
54010. pieces.
54011. 
54012. "But they'll make grand leg bands, dear friend," he said, and went back
54013. into the shed.
54014. 
54015. 
54016. 
54017. 
54018. 
54019. CHAPTER XII
54020. 
54021. 
54022. Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though
54023. the French had offered to move him from the men's to the officers' shed,
54024. he had stayed in the shed where he was first put.
54025. 
54026. In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme
54027. limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his physical
54028. strength and health, of which he had till then been unconscious, and
54029. thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that
54030. it was impossible to say when they began, he endured his position
54031. not only lightly but joyfully. And just at this time he obtained the
54032. tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach.
54033. He had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind, that
54034. inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle
54035. of Borodino. He had sought it in philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the
54036. dissipations of town life, in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice,
54037. and in romantic love for Natasha; he had sought it by reasoning--and all
54038. these quests and experiments had failed him. And now without thinking
54039. about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the
54040. horror of death, through privation, and through what he recognized in
54041. Karataev.
54042. 
54043. Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it
54044. were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating
54045. thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. It did
54046. not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or
54047. Napoleon. It was plain to him that all these things were no business
54048. of his, and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and
54049. therefore could not do so. "Russia and summer weather are not bound
54050. together," he thought, repeating words of Karataev's which he found
54051. strangely consoling. His intention of killing Napoleon and his
54052. calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now
54053. seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. His anger with his wife
54054. and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely
54055. trivial but even amusing. What concern was it of his that somewhere or
54056. other that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter
54057. to anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out that
54058. their prisoner's name was Count Bezukhov?
54059. 
54060. He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite
54061. agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew's thoughts somewhat
54062. differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could
54063. only be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony
54064. as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is
54065. implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre
54066. believed it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering,
54067. the satisfaction of one's needs and consequent freedom in the choice of
54068. one's occupation, that is, of one's way of life, now seemed to Pierre to
54069. be indubitably man's highest happiness. Here and now for the first time
54070. he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat,
54071. drinking when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of
54072. warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to
54073. talk and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of one's needs--good
54074. food, cleanliness, and freedom--now that he was deprived of all this,
54075. seemed to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice
54076. of occupation, that is, of his way of life--now that that was so
54077. restricted--seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a
54078. superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying one's
54079. needs, while great freedom in the choice of occupation--such freedom as
54080. his wealth, his education, and his social position had given him in
54081. his own life--is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly
54082. difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an
54083. occupation.
54084. 
54085. All Pierre's daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free. Yet
54086. subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke with
54087. enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable, strong,
54088. joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner
54089. freedom which he experienced only during those weeks.
54090. 
54091. When on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn, and
54092. saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still dark
54093. at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the
54094. wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance,
54095. when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the
54096. crows flying from Moscow across the field, and when afterwards light
54097. gleamed from the east and the sun's rim appeared solemnly from behind a
54098. cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the
54099. river, all began to sparkle in the glad light--Pierre felt a new joy and
54100. strength in life such as he had never before known. And this not only
54101. stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in
54102. strength as the hardships of his position increased.
54103. 
54104. That feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still
54105. further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners
54106. formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge
54107. of languages, the respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his
54108. readiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance
54109. of three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength, which he
54110. showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut; his
54111. gentleness to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still and
54112. thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them incomprehensible),
54113. he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being. The very
54114. qualities that had been a hindrance, if not actually harmful, to him in
54115. the world he had lived in--his strength, his disdain for the comforts of
54116. life, his absent-mindedness and simplicity--here among these people
54117. gave him almost the status of a hero. And Pierre felt that their opinion
54118. placed responsibilities upon him.
54119. 
54120. 
54121. 
54122. 
54123. 
54124. CHAPTER XIII
54125. 
54126. 
54127. The French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh
54128. of October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts loaded, and troops
54129. and baggage trains started.
54130. 
54131. At seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing shakos
54132. and carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in front
54133. of the sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses sounded all
54134. along the lines.
54135. 
54136. In the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only awaited
54137. the order to start. The sick soldier, Sokolov, pale and thin with dark
54138. shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed.
54139. His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly
54140. at his comrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned
54141. regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so much his sufferings that
54142. caused him to moan (he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at being
54143. left alone.
54144. 
54145. Pierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes Karataev had
54146. made for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest
54147. and brought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and
54148. squatted down beside him.
54149. 
54150. "You know, Sokolov, they are not all going away! They have a hospital
54151. here. You may be better off than we others," said Pierre.
54152. 
54153. "O Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!" moaned the man in a
54154. louder voice.
54155. 
54156. "I'll go and ask them again directly," said Pierre, rising and going to
54157. the door of the shed.
54158. 
54159. Just as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him a
54160. pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal and
54161. soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal
54162. straps, and these changed their familiar faces.
54163. 
54164. The corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The prisoners
54165. had to be counted before being let out.
54166. 
54167. "Corporal, what will they do with the sick man?..." Pierre began.
54168. 
54169. But even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal
54170. he knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that
54171. moment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums
54172. was suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at Pierre's
54173. words and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed
54174. became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned
54175. the sick man's groans.
54176. 
54177. "There it is!... It again!..." said Pierre to himself, and an
54178. involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal's changed face,
54179. in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the
54180. drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled
54181. people against their will to kill their fellow men--that force the
54182. effect of which he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or to
54183. try to escape that force, to address entreaties or exhortations to those
54184. who served as its tools, was useless. Pierre knew this now. One had to
54185. wait and endure. He did not again go to the sick man, nor turn to look
54186. at him, but stood frowning by the door of the hut.
54187. 
54188. When that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one
54189. another like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed
54190. his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had
54191. assured him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also in
54192. marching kit, and on his cold face appeared that same it which Pierre
54193. had recognized in the corporal's words and in the roll of the drums.
54194. 
54195. "Pass on, pass on!" the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and
54196. looking at the prisoners who thronged past him.
54197. 
54198. Pierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.
54199. 
54200. "What now?" the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing
54201. Pierre.
54202. 
54203. Pierre told him about the sick man.
54204. 
54205. "He'll manage to walk, devil take him!" said the captain. "Pass on, pass
54206. on!" he continued without looking at Pierre.
54207. 
54208. "But he is dying," Pierre again began.
54209. 
54210. "Be so good..." shouted the captain, frowning angrily.
54211. 
54212. "Dram-da-da-dam, dam-dam..." rattled the drums, and Pierre understood
54213. that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it
54214. was now useless to say any more.
54215. 
54216. The officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march
54217. in front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among them, and
54218. about three hundred men.
54219. 
54220. The officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all strangers to
54221. Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at him and at his
54222. shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major
54223. with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a Kazan dressing
54224. gown tied round with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed the respect of
54225. his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco
54226. pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his
54227. pipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and
54228. growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that
54229. they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were
54230. all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at.
54231. Another, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing
54232. where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day. An
54233. official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from
54234. side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his
54235. observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part
54236. of the city was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent
54237. was a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was
54238. mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.
54239. 
54240. "What are you disputing about?" said the major angrily. "What does it
54241. matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it's burned
54242. down, and there's an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isn't the
54243. road wide enough?" said he, turning to a man behind him who was not
54244. pushing him at all.
54245. 
54246. "Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?" the prisoners on one side and another
54247. were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. "All beyond the
54248. river, and Zubova, and in the Kremlin.... Just look! There's not half of
54249. it left. Yes, I told you--the whole quarter beyond the river, and so it
54250. is."
54251. 
54252. "Well, you know it's burned, so what's the use of talking?" said the
54253. major.
54254. 
54255. As they passed near a church in the Khamovniki (one of the few unburned
54256. quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one
54257. side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.
54258. 
54259. "Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And
54260. smeared with something!"
54261. 
54262. Pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these
54263. exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the palings
54264. surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw better
54265. than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upright
54266. against the palings with its face smeared with soot.
54267. 
54268. "Go on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!..." the convoy
54269. guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh virulence,
54270. drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at
54271. the dead man.
54272. 
54273. 
54274. 
54275. 
54276. 
54277. CHAPTER XIV
54278. 
54279. 
54280. Through the cross streets of the Khamovniki quarter the prisoners
54281. marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons
54282. belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they
54283. came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with
54284. private vehicles.
54285. 
54286. At the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across.
54287. From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage
54288. trains before and behind them. To the right, where the Kaluga road turns
54289. near Neskuchny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into
54290. the distance. These were troops of Beauharnais' corps which had started
54291. before any of the others. Behind, along the riverside and across the
54292. Stone Bridge, were Ney's troops and transport.
54293. 
54294. Davout's troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the
54295. Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kaluga road.
54296. But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnais'
54297. train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Kaluga road when
54298. the vanguard of Ney's army was already emerging from the Great Ordynka
54299. Street.
54300. 
54301. When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps
54302. forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and men
54303. crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few hundred paces
54304. that separated the bridge from the Kaluga road, taking more than an
54305. hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the
54306. Transmoskva ward and the Kaluga road converge, and the prisoners jammed
54307. close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway. From all
54308. sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard the rattle of wheels, the
54309. tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre stood
54310. pressed against the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise
54311. which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums.
54312. 
54313. To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of
54314. the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.
54315. 
54316. "What crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They've loaded goods even on
54317. the cannon! Look there, those are furs!" they exclaimed. "Just see what
54318. the blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one has behind
54319. in the cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by
54320. heaven!... Oh, the rascals!... See how that fellow has loaded
54321. himself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, they've even grabbed those
54322. chaises!... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks.... Heavens!
54323. They're fighting."
54324. 
54325. "That's right, hit him on the snout--on his snout! Like this, we
54326. shan't get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be
54327. Napoleon's own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! It's
54328. like a portable house.... That fellow's dropped his sack and doesn't see
54329. it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either!
54330. Yes, I dare say, that's the way they'll let you pass... Just look,
54331. there's no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven, so they are! In
54332. carriages--see how comfortably they've settled themselves!"
54333. 
54334. Again, as at the church in Khamovniki, a wave of general curiosity
54335. bore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to
54336. his stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their
54337. curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts, closely
54338. squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in glaring
54339. colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.
54340. 
54341. From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious
54342. force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse
54343. smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned
54344. ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression
54345. on him--as if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused to
54346. receive impressions that might weaken it.
54347. 
54348. The women's vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers,
54349. wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts,
54350. more soldiers, and now and then women.
54351. 
54352. Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.
54353. 
54354. All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible
54355. power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came flowing from
54356. the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly;
54357. they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white
54358. teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from
54359. side to side, and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute
54360. and coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the
54361. corporal's face when the drums were beating.
54362. 
54363. It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort
54364. collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among
54365. the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged
54366. onto the Kaluga road.
54367. 
54368. They marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the sun
54369. began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men
54370. began to prepare for their night's rest. They all appeared angry and
54371. dissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could
54372. be heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran
54373. into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several
54374. soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat the
54375. carriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others fought among
54376. themselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the head
54377. by a sword.
54378. 
54379. It seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid fields
54380. in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and the same
54381. feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on
54382. that had seized them at the start. Once at a standstill they all seemed
54383. to understand that they did not yet know where they were going, and that
54384. much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey.
54385. 
54386. During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they
54387. had done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the first time
54388. received horseflesh for their meat ration.
54389. 
54390. From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like
54391. personal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to
54392. their former friendly relations.
54393. 
54394. This spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of
54395. prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian
54396. soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw
54397. a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from
54398. the road, and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to
54399. court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the
54400. Russian. To the noncommissioned officer's excuse that the prisoner was
54401. ill and could not walk, the officer replied that the order was to shoot
54402. those who lagged behind. Pierre felt that that fatal force which had
54403. crushed him during the executions, but which he had not felt during his
54404. imprisonment, now again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but
54405. he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush
54406. him, there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent
54407. of it.
54408. 
54409. He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his
54410. comrades.
54411. 
54412. Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in
54413. Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of the
54414. order to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in reaction
54415. against the worsening of their position they were all particularly
54416. animated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences, of amusing
54417. scenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and avoided all talk of
54418. their present situation.
54419. 
54420. The sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in the
54421. sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the
54422. rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray
54423. haze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night had not yet
54424. come. Pierre got up and left his new companions, crossing between the
54425. campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the
54426. common soldier prisoners were stationed. He wanted to talk to them. On
54427. the road he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back.
54428. 
54429. Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an
54430. unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him and
54431. dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the
54432. cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought. Suddenly he
54433. burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that
54434. men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and
54435. evidently solitary laughter could mean.
54436. 
54437. "Ha-ha-ha!" laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: "The soldier
54438. did not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me captive.
54439. What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!..." and he laughed
54440. till tears started to his eyes.
54441. 
54442. A man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at
54443. all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther away from
54444. the inquisitive man, and looked around him.
54445. 
54446. The huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the
54447. crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the
54448. red campfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the light
54449. sky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, unseen
54450. before, were now visible in the distance. And farther still, beyond
54451. those forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless distance
54452. lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling
54453. stars in its faraway depths. "And all that is me, all that is within me,
54454. and it is all I!" thought Pierre. "And they caught all that and put it
54455. into a shed boarded up with planks!" He smiled, and went and lay down to
54456. sleep beside his companions.
54457. 
54458. 
54459. 
54460. 
54461. 
54462. CHAPTER XV
54463. 
54464. 
54465. In the early days of October another envoy came to Kutuzov with a letter
54466. from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow, though
54467. Napoleon was already not far from Kutuzov on the old Kaluga road.
54468. Kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly
54469. brought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.
54470. 
54471. Soon after that a report was received from Dorokhov's guerrilla
54472. detachment operating to the left of Tarutino that troops of Broussier's
54473. division had been seen at Forminsk and that being separated from the
54474. rest of the French army they might easily be destroyed. The soldiers and
54475. officers again demanded action. Generals on the staff, excited by the
54476. memory of the easy victory at Tarutino, urged Kutuzov to carry out
54477. Dorokhov's suggestion. Kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessary.
54478. The result was a compromise which was inevitable: a small detachment was
54479. sent to Forminsk to attack Broussier.
54480. 
54481. By a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most
54482. difficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhturov--that same
54483. modest little Dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up
54484. plans of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses
54485. on batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of
54486. as undecided and undiscerning--but whom we find commanding wherever
54487. the position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from
54488. Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he remained last at the
54489. Augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what was possible when all
54490. were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear
54491. guard. Ill with fever he went to Smolensk with twenty thousand men
54492. to defend the town against Napoleon's whole army. In Smolensk, at the
54493. Malakhov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he
54494. was awakened by the bombardment of the town--and Smolensk held out all
54495. day long. At the battle of Borodino, when Bagration was killed and nine
54496. tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the
54497. French artillery fire was directed against it, the man sent there was
54498. this same irresolute and undiscerning Dokhturov--Kutuzov hastening to
54499. rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first.
54500. And the quiet little Dokhturov rode thither, and Borodino became the
54501. greatest glory of the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to
54502. us in verse and prose, but of Dokhturov scarcely a word has been said.
54503. 
54504. It was Dokhturov again whom they sent to Forminsk and from there to
54505. Malo-Yaroslavets, the place where the last battle with the French was
54506. fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began;
54507. and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the
54508. campaign, but of Dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that
54509. dubiously. And this silence about Dokhturov is the clearest testimony to
54510. his merit.
54511. 
54512. It is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a
54513. machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance
54514. and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most
54515. important part. The man who does not understand the construction of
54516. the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which
54517. revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine, and
54518. not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.
54519. 
54520. On the tenth of October when Dokhturov had gone halfway to Forminsk and
54521. stopped at the village of Aristovo, preparing faithfully to execute the
54522. orders he had received, the whole French army having, in its convulsive
54523. movement, reached Murat's position apparently in order to give
54524. battle--suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new
54525. Kaluga road and began to enter Forminsk, where only Broussier had
54526. been till then. At that time Dokhturov had under his command, besides
54527. Dorokhov's detachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and
54528. Seslavin.
54529. 
54530. On the evening of October 11 Seslavin came to the Aristovo headquarters
54531. with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the
54532. troops that had entered Forminsk that day were the vanguard of the whole
54533. army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four
54534. days previously. That same evening a house serf who had come from
54535. Borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town. Some
54536. Cossacks of Dokhturov's detachment reported having sighted the French
54537. Guards marching along the road to Borovsk. From all these reports it was
54538. evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there
54539. was now the whole French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected
54540. direction--along the Kaluga road. Dokhturov was unwilling to undertake
54541. any action, as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do. He had
54542. been ordered to attack Forminsk. But only Broussier had been there at
54543. that time and now the whole French army was there. Ermolov wished to act
54544. on his own judgment, but Dokhturov insisted that he must have Kutuzov's
54545. instructions. So it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff.
54546. 
54547. For this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovitinov, was chosen, who
54548. was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering
54549. a written report. Toward midnight Bolkhovitinov, having received the
54550. dispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff
54551. accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.
54552. 
54553. 
54554. 
54555. 
54556. 
54557. CHAPTER XVI
54558. 
54559. 
54560. It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four days.
54561. Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a
54562. half over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhovitinov reached Litashevka after
54563. one o'clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence
54564. hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he entered
54565. a dark passage.
54566. 
54567. "The general on duty, quick! It's very important!" said he to someone
54568. who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.
54569. 
54570. "He has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night
54571. he has not slept," said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. "You should
54572. wake the captain first."
54573. 
54574. "But this is very important, from General Dokhturov," said
54575. Bolkhovitinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in
54576. the dark.
54577. 
54578. The orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.
54579. 
54580. "Your honor, your honor! A courier."
54581. 
54582. "What? What's that? From whom?" came a sleepy voice.
54583. 
54584. "From Dokhturov and from Alexey Petrovich. Napoleon is at Forminsk,"
54585. said Bolkhovitinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but
54586. guessing by the voice that it was not Konovnitsyn.
54587. 
54588. The man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.
54589. 
54590. "I don't like waking him," he said, fumbling for something. "He is very
54591. ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor."
54592. 
54593. "Here is the dispatch," said Bolkhovitinov. "My orders are to give it at
54594. once to the general on duty."
54595. 
54596. "Wait a moment, I'll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you
54597. always hide it?" said the voice of the man who was stretching himself,
54598. to the orderly. (This was Shcherbinin, Konovnitsyn's adjutant.) "I've
54599. found it, I've found it!" he added.
54600. 
54601. The orderly was striking a light and Shcherbinin was fumbling for
54602. something on the candlestick.
54603. 
54604. "Oh, the nasty beasts!" said he with disgust.
54605. 
54606. By the light of the sparks Bolkhovitinov saw Shcherbinin's youthful face
54607. as he held the candle, and the face of another man who was still asleep.
54608. This was Konovnitsyn.
54609. 
54610. When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned
54611. up, first blue and then red, Shcherbinin lit the tallow candle, from
54612. the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were
54613. running away, and looked at the messenger. Bolkhovitinov was bespattered
54614. all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve.
54615. 
54616. "Who gave the report?" inquired Shcherbinin, taking the envelope.
54617. 
54618. "The news is reliable," said Bolkhovitinov. "Prisoners, Cossacks, and
54619. the scouts all say the same thing."
54620. 
54621. "There's nothing to be done, we'll have to wake him," said Shcherbinin,
54622. rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a
54623. greatcoat. "Peter Petrovich!" said he. (Konovnitsyn did not stir.) "To
54624. the General Staff!" he said with a smile, knowing that those words would
54625. be sure to arouse him.
54626. 
54627. And in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On
54628. Konovnitsyn's handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever,
54629. there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote
54630. from present affairs, but then he suddenly started and his face assumed
54631. its habitual calm and firm appearance.
54632. 
54633. "Well, what is it? From whom?" he asked immediately but without hurry,
54634. blinking at the light.
54635. 
54636. While listening to the officer's report Konovnitsyn broke the seal and
54637. read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in
54638. their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his
54639. boots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair over his temples,
54640. and donned his cap.
54641. 
54642. "Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness."
54643. 
54644. Konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great
54645. importance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or ask
54646. himself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest him. He
54647. regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his
54648. reason but by something else. There was within him a deep unexpressed
54649. conviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this
54650. and still less speak about it, but must only attend to one's own work.
54651. And he did his work, giving his whole strength to the task.
54652. 
54653. Peter Petrovich Konovnitsyn, like Dokhturov, seems to have been included
54654. merely for propriety's sake in the list of the so-called heroes of
54655. 1812--the Barclays, Raevskis, Ermolovs, Platovs, and Miloradoviches.
54656. Like Dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited
54657. capacity and information, and like Dokhturov he never made plans of
54658. battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult.
54659. Since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his
54660. door open, giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake
54661. him up. In battle he was always under fire, so that Kutuzov reproved him
54662. for it and feared to send him to the front, and like Dokhturov he
54663. was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that, without clatter or noise,
54664. constitute the most essential part of the machine.
54665. 
54666. Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovnitsyn
54667. frowned--partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at
54668. the unpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest
54669. of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news,
54670. especially Bennigsen, who ever since Tarutino had been at daggers
54671. drawn with Kutuzov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel, issue
54672. orders, and rescind them. And this premonition was disagreeable to him
54673. though he knew it could not be helped.
54674. 
54675. And in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news, immediately
54676. began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters, until
54677. Konovnitsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded him that they must
54678. go to see his Highness.
54679. 
54680. 
54681. 
54682. 
54683. 
54684. CHAPTER XVII
54685. 
54686. 
54687. Kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often fell
54688. asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed
54689. without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.
54690. 
54691. So he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred head on
54692. his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and peering into the
54693. darkness.
54694. 
54695. Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more
54696. influence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him, Kutuzov
54697. was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being
54698. obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The lesson of the
54699. Tarutino battle and of the day before it, which Kutuzov remembered with
54700. pain, must, he thought, have some effect on others too.
54701. 
54702. "They must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.
54703. Patience and time are my warriors, my champions," thought Kutuzov. He
54704. knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall
54705. of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree
54706. is harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman
54707. he knew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as only the whole
54708. strength of Russia could have wounded it, but whether it was mortally
54709. wounded or not was still an undecided question. Now by the fact of
54710. Lauriston and Barthelemi having been sent, and by the reports of the
54711. guerrillas, Kutuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he
54712. needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait.
54713. 
54714. "They want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall
54715. see! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!" thought he. "What for?
54716. Only to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are
54717. like children from whom one can't get any sensible account of what has
54718. happened because they all want to show how well they can fight. But
54719. that's not what is needed now.
54720. 
54721. "And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to
54722. them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies" (he
54723. remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) "they have
54724. foreseen everything. But the contingencies are endless."
54725. 
54726. The undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodino was
54727. mortal or not had hung over Kutuzov's head for a whole month. On the one
54728. hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kutuzov felt assured
54729. with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the
54730. Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal. But in any
54731. case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew
54732. more impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed during those
54733. sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals
54734. for doing. He imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like
54735. the younger men, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of
54736. contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them. The
54737. longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves. He
54738. imagined all sorts of movements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or
54739. in sections--against Petersburg, or against him, or to outflank him.
54740. He thought too of the possibility (which he feared most of all) that
54741. Napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in Moscow
54742. awaiting him. Kutuzov even imagined that Napoleon's army might turn back
54743. through Medyn and Yukhnov, but the one thing he could not foresee was
54744. what happened--the insane, convulsive stampede of Napoleon's army
54745. during its first eleven days after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made
54746. possible what Kutuzov had not yet even dared to think of--the complete
54747. extermination of the French. Dorokhov's report about Broussier's
54748. division, the guerrillas' reports of distress in Napoleon's army, rumors
54749. of preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that
54750. the French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were
54751. only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not to
54752. Kutuzov. With his sixty years' experience he knew what value to attach
54753. to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news
54754. so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew how readily
54755. in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary. And the more
54756. he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it. This question
54757. absorbed all his mental powers. All else was to him only life's
54758. customary routine. To such customary routine belonged his conversations
54759. with the staff, the letters he wrote from Tarutino to Madame de Stael,
54760. the reading of novels, the distribution of awards, his correspondence
54761. with Petersburg, and so on. But the destruction of the French, which he
54762. alone foresaw, was his heart's one desire.
54763. 
54764. On the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm and
54765. thinking of that.
54766. 
54767. There was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll,
54768. Konovnitsyn, and Bolkhovitinov.
54769. 
54770. "Eh, who's there? Come in, come in! What news?" the field marshal called
54771. out to them.
54772. 
54773. While a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the substance
54774. of the news.
54775. 
54776. "Who brought it?" asked Kutuzov with a look which, when the candle was
54777. lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.
54778. 
54779. "There can be no doubt about it, your Highness."
54780. 
54781. "Call him in, call him here."
54782. 
54783. Kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch
54784. resting against the other which was doubled under him. He screwed up his
54785. seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully, as if wishing to
54786. read in his face what preoccupied his own mind.
54787. 
54788. "Tell me, tell me, friend," said he to Bolkhovitinov in his low, aged
54789. voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest,
54790. "come nearer--nearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That Napoleon
54791. has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?"
54792. 
54793. Bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had
54794. been told to report.
54795. 
54796. "Speak quicker, quicker! Don't torture me!" Kutuzov interrupted him.
54797. 
54798. Bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting
54799. instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but Kutuzov checked
54800. him. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered and
54801. wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side of
54802. the room, to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there.
54803. 
54804. "O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer..." said he in a
54805. tremulous voice with folded hands. "Russia is saved. I thank Thee, O
54806. Lord!" and he wept.
54807. 
54808. 
54809. 
54810. 
54811. 
54812. CHAPTER XVIII
54813. 
54814. 
54815. From the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all
54816. Kutuzov's activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by
54817. authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks,
54818. maneuvers, or encounters with the perishing enemy. Dokhturov went to
54819. Malo-Yaroslavets, but Kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave
54820. orders for the evacuation of Kaluga--a retreat beyond which town seemed
54821. to him quite possible.
54822. 
54823. Everywhere Kutuzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for his
54824. retreat fled in the opposite direction.
54825. 
54826. Napoleon's historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at Tarutino
54827. and Malo-Yaroslavets, and make conjectures as to what would have
54828. happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern
54829. provinces.
54830. 
54831. But not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing
54832. into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did not bar his
54833. way), the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army, for
54834. then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin. How
54835. could that army--which had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had
54836. trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them, and on arriving at
54837. Smolensk had looted provisions instead of storing them--how could that
54838. army recuperate in Kaluga province, which was inhabited by Russians such
54839. as those who lived in Moscow, and where fire had the same property of
54840. consuming what was set ablaze?
54841. 
54842. That army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of Borodino
54843. and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, the
54844. chemical elements of dissolution.
54845. 
54846. The members of what had once been an army--Napoleon himself and all his
54847. soldiers fled--without knowing whither, each concerned only to make his
54848. escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the hopelessness of
54849. which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.
54850. 
54851. So it came about that at the council at Malo-Yaroslavets, when the
54852. generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all
54853. mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier
54854. Mouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing
54855. needful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not
54856. even Napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all
54857. recognized.
54858. 
54859. But though they all realized that it was necessary to get away, there
54860. still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee. An
54861. external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this shock came in
54862. due time. It was what the French called "le hourra de l'Empereur."
54863. 
54864. The day after the council at Malo-Yaroslavets Napoleon rode out early in
54865. the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and
54866. an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the
54867. previous and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks on the prowl for
54868. booty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly captured him. If the
54869. Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very
54870. thing that was destroying the French army, the booty on which the
54871. Cossacks fell. Here as at Tarutino they went after plunder, leaving the
54872. men. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon
54873. managed to escape.
54874. 
54875. When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself
54876. in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was nothing for it but
54877. to fly as fast as possible along the nearest, familiar road. Napoleon
54878. with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his
54879. former agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright
54880. the Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued
54881. orders--as the historians tell us--to retreat by the Smolensk road.
54882. 
54883. That Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated, does
54884. not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces which
54885. influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozhaysk (that is,
54886. the Smolensk) road acted simultaneously on him also.
54887. 
54888. 
54889. 
54890. 
54891. 
54892. CHAPTER XIX
54893. 
54894. 
54895. A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To be able to go
54896. a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the
54897. end of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a promised
54898. land to have the strength to move.
54899. 
54900. The promised land for the French during their advance had been Moscow,
54901. during their retreat it was their native land. But that native land
54902. was too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely
54903. necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself: "Today I
54904. shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and
54905. spend the night," and during the first day's journey that resting place
54906. eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires. And
54907. the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.
54908. 
54909. For the French retreating along the old Smolensk road, the final
54910. goal--their native land--was too remote, and their immediate goal
54911. was Smolensk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously
54912. intensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that
54913. much food and fresh troops awaited them in Smolensk, nor that they were
54914. told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon himself,
54915. knew that provisions were scarce there), but because this alone could
54916. give them strength to move on and endure their present privations. So
54917. both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves, and
54918. pushed on to Smolensk as to a promised land.
54919. 
54920. Coming out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy
54921. and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. Besides the
54922. common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and
54923. supplied them with a certain energy, there was another cause binding
54924. them together--their great numbers. As with the physical law of gravity,
54925. their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself. In their
54926. hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation.
54927. 
54928. Each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner
54929. to escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one hand the force
54930. of this common attraction to Smolensk, their goal, drew each of them in
54931. the same direction; on the other hand an army corps could not surrender
54932. to a company, and though the French availed themselves of every
54933. convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the
54934. slightest decent pretext, such pretexts did not always occur. Their
54935. very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that
54936. possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the
54937. Russians to stop this movement, to which the French were directing all
54938. their energies. Beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the
54939. body could hasten the process of decomposition.
54940. 
54941. A lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a certain
54942. limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow. On
54943. the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow
54944. becomes.
54945. 
54946. Of the Russian commanders Kutuzov alone understood this. When the flight
54947. of the French army along the Smolensk road became well defined, what
54948. Konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of October began
54949. to occur. The superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves,
54950. to cut off, to seize, to capture, and to overthrow the French, and all
54951. clamored for action.
54952. 
54953. Kutuzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited in the
54954. case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.
54955. 
54956. He could not tell them what we say now: "Why fight, why block the road,
54957. losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches? What
54958. is the use of that, when a third of their army has melted away on the
54959. road from Moscow to Vyazma without any battle?" But drawing from his
54960. aged wisdom what they could understand, he told them of the golden
54961. bridge, and they laughed at and slandered him, flinging themselves on,
54962. rending and exulting over the dying beast.
54963. 
54964. Ermolov, Miloradovich, Platov, and others in proximity to the French
54965. near Vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two
54966. French corps, and by way of reporting their intention to Kutuzov they
54967. sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.
54968. 
54969. And try as Kutuzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked,
54970. trying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to the
54971. attack with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost thousands
54972. of men.
54973. 
54974. But they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army,
54975. closing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily melting
54976. away, to pursue its fatal path to Smolensk.

54989. 
54990. 
54991. The Battle of Borodino, with the occupation of Moscow that followed it
54992. and the flight of the French without further conflicts, is one of the
54993. most instructive phenomena in history.
54994. 
54995. All historians agree that the external activity of states and nations
54996. in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars, and that as a
54997. direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength
54998. of states and nations increases or decreases.
54999. 
55000. Strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor,
55001. having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemy's
55002. army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and
55003. subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all
55004. the facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the
55005. statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another
55006. is the cause, or at least an essential indication, of an increase or
55007. decrease in the strength of the nation--even though it is unintelligible
55008. why the defeat of an army--a hundredth part of a nation--should oblige
55009. that whole nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the
55010. rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the
55011. defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its
55012. rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army
55013. suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.
55014. 
55015. So according to history it has been found from the most ancient times,
55016. and so it is to our own day. All Napoleon's wars serve to confirm this
55017. rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses
55018. its rights, and the rights and the strength of France increase. The
55019. victories of the French at Jena and Auerstadt destroy the independent
55020. existence of Prussia.
55021. 
55022. But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow is
55023. taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia that
55024. ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and
55025. then Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of
55026. history: to say that the field of battle at Borodino remained in the
55027. hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles
55028. that destroyed Napoleon's army, is impossible.
55029. 
55030. After the French victory at Borodino there was no general engagement nor
55031. any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What
55032. does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China,
55033. we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the
55034. historians' usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards);
55035. if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number
55036. of troops took part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event
55037. occurred before our fathers' eyes, and for them it was a question of the
55038. life or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of
55039. all known wars.
55040. 
55041. The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodino to the
55042. expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not
55043. produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest;
55044. it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in
55045. the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.
55046. 
55047. The French historians, describing the condition of the French army
55048. before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army,
55049. except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport--there was no
55050. forage for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could
55051. remedy, for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than
55052. let the French have it.
55053. 
55054. The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants
55055. Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their
55056. carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest
55057. any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such
55058. peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered
55059. them, but burned it instead.
55060. 
55061. Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers
55062. according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has
55063. gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself
55064. wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his
55065. life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to
55066. hand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine that the combatant who
55067. so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was
55068. at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to
55069. conceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory
55070. with the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what
55071. confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel.
55072. 
55073. The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was
55074. the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up
55075. the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter
55076. according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described
55077. the event.
55078. 
55079. After the burning of Smolensk a war began which did not follow any
55080. previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the
55081. retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodino and the renewed
55082. retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of
55083. transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.
55084. 
55085. Napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing
55086. attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent's rapier saw a cudgel
55087. raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kutuzov and to
55088. the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all
55089. the rules--as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of
55090. the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in
55091. spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather
55092. disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en
55093. quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit
55094. thrust en prime, and so on--the cudgel of the people's war was lifted
55095. with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting
55096. anyone's tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and
55097. fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French
55098. till the whole invasion had perished.
55099. 
55100. And it is well for a people who do not--as the French did in
55101. 1813--salute according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt
55102. of their rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous
55103. conqueror, but at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others
55104. have adopted in similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first
55105. cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of
55106. resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and
55107. compassion.
55108. 
55109. 
55110. 
55111. 
55112. 
55113. CHAPTER II
55114. 
55115. 
55116. One of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so-called
55117. laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed
55118. together in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that take on a
55119. national character. In such actions, instead of two crowds opposing
55120. each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when attacked by
55121. stronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers. This was done
55122. by the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and
55123. by the Russians in 1812.
55124. 
55125. People have called this kind of war "guerrilla warfare" and assume that
55126. by so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a war does
55127. not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule
55128. of tactics which is accepted as infallible. That rule says that an
55129. attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his
55130. opponent at the moment of conflict.
55131. 
55132. Guerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly infringes
55133. that rule.
55134. 
55135. This contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes
55136. the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers. Military
55137. science says that the more troops the greater the strength. Les gros
55138. bataillons ont toujours raison. *
55139. 
55140. 
55141.     * Large battalions are always victorious.
55142. 
55143. 
55144. For military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics
55145. by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal
55146. to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal.
55147. 
55148. Momentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.
55149. 
55150. In military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass
55151. and some unknown x.
55152. 
55153. Military science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact
55154. that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that
55155. small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the existence
55156. of this unknown factor and tries to discover it--now in a geometric
55157. formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most usually, in the
55158. genius of the commanders. But the assignment of these various meanings
55159. to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic
55160. facts.
55161. 
55162. Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to gratify
55163. the "heroes") of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by
55164. commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.
55165. 
55166. That unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the
55167. greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men
55168. composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are not,
55169. fighting under the command of a genius, in two--or three-line formation,
55170. with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute. Men
55171. who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous
55172. conditions for fighting.
55173. 
55174. The spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives
55175. the resulting force. To define and express the significance of this
55176. unknown factor--the spirit of an army--is a problem for science.
55177. 
55178. This problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute
55179. for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes
55180. apparent--such as the commands of the general, the equipment employed,
55181. and so on--mistaking these for the real significance of the factor,
55182. and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being
55183. the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger. Only then,
55184. expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative
55185. significance of this factor, can we hope to define the unknown.
55186. 
55187. Ten men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions, or
55188. divisions, conquer--that is, kill or take captive--all the others, while
55189. themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and on the other
55190. fifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen, and
55191. therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This equation does not
55192. give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two
55193. unknowns. And by bringing variously selected historic units (battles,
55194. campaigns, periods of war) into such equations, a series of numbers
55195. could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be
55196. discovered.
55197. 
55198. The tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, and
55199. in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the
55200. strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under
55201. fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed
55202. than is needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of
55203. account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in
55204. particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or
55205. fall in the spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national wars.
55206. 
55207. The French, retreating in 1812--though according to tactics they should
55208. have separated into detachments to defend themselves--congregated into
55209. a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass
55210. held the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according
55211. to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up
55212. into small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate
55213. individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing
55214. any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and
55215. dangers.
55216. 
55217. 
55218. 
55219. 
55220. 
55221. CHAPTER III
55222. 
55223. 
55224. The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into
55225. Smolensk.
55226. 
55227. Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the
55228. government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had
55229. been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off
55230. as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. Denis Davydov,
55231. with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the value of
55232. this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science
55233. destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit for taking the first
55234. step toward regularizing this method of warfare.
55235. 
55236. On August 24 Davydov's first partisan detachment was formed and then
55237. others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more
55238. numerous these detachments became.
55239. 
55240. The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the
55241. fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree--the
55242. French army--and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when
55243. the French were fleeing toward Smolensk, there were hundreds of such
55244. companies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that adopted
55245. all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and the
55246. comforts of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry. There were
55247. also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and
55248. landowners that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded one party which
55249. captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month; and there
55250. was Vasilisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew hundreds of the
55251. French.
55252. 
55253. The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of
55254. October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,
55255. amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded
55256. and captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling,
55257. hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the end
55258. of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had become
55259. clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what could
55260. not. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and moving
55261. according to rules at a distance from the French, still regarded many
55262. things as impossible. The small bands that had started their activities
55263. long before and had already observed the French closely considered
55264. things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare
55265. to contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among the French
55266. now considered everything possible.
55267. 
55268. On October 22, Denisov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his
55269. group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning he
55270. and his party had been on the move. All day long he had been watching
55271. from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of
55272. cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the
55273. army, which--as was learned from spies and prisoners--was moving under a
55274. strong escort to Smolensk. Besides Denisov and Dolokhov (who also led
55275. a small party and moved in Denisov's vicinity), the commanders of some
55276. large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and, as Denisov
55277. expressed it, were sharpening their teeth for it. Two of the commanders
55278. of large parties--one a Pole and the other a German--sent invitations
55279. to Denisov almost simultaneously, requesting him to join up with their
55280. divisions to attack the convoy.
55281. 
55282. "No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself," said Denisov on reading
55283. these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite his heartfelt
55284. desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general, he had to forgo
55285. that pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish
55286. general. To the Polish general he replied to the same effect, informing
55287. him that he was already under the command of the German.
55288. 
55289. Having arranged matters thus, Denisov and Dolokhov intended, without
55290. reporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that
55291. convoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from
55292. the village of Mikulino to that of Shamshevo. To the left of the road
55293. between Mikulino and Shamshevo there were large forests, extending in
55294. some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back
55295. from it. Through these forests Denisov and his party rode all day,
55296. sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very
55297. edge, but never losing sight of the moving French. That morning,
55298. Cossacks of Denisov's party had seized and carried off into the forest
55299. two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not
55300. far from Mikulino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then,
55301. and until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French
55302. without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach Shamshevo
55303. quietly without alarming them and then, after joining Dolokhov who was
55304. to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman's hut in the forest
55305. less than a mile from Shamshevo, to surprise the French at dawn, falling
55306. like an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and rout and capture
55307. them all at one blow.
55308. 
55309. In their rear, more than a mile from Mikulino where the forest came
55310. right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh
55311. columns of French should show themselves.
55312. 
55313. Beyond Shamshevo, Dolokhov was to observe the road in the same way, to
55314. find out at what distance there were other French troops. They reckoned
55315. that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Denisov had two hundred, and
55316. Dolokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not
55317. deter Denisov. All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were
55318. and to learn that he had to capture a "tongue"--that is, a man from
55319. the enemy column. That morning's attack on the wagons had been made so
55320. hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a
55321. little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he
55322. could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column.
55323. 
55324. Denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of
55325. putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent Tikhon Shcherbaty, a
55326. peasant of his party, to Shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the
55327. French quartermasters who had been sent on in advance.
55328. 
55329. 
55330. 
55331. 
55332. 
55333. CHAPTER IV
55334. 
55335. 
55336. It was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both
55337. the color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and then
55338. suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.
55339. 
55340. Denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down
55341. was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. Like his horse,
55342. which turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving
55343. rain and gazed anxiously before him. His thin face with its short, thick
55344. black beard looked angry.
55345. 
55346. Beside Denisov rode an esaul, * Denisov's fellow worker, also in felt
55347. cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.
55348. 
55349. 
55350.     * A captain of Cossacks.
55351. 
55352. 
55353. Esaul Lovayski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,
55354. pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm
55355. self-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to
55356. say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first
55357. glance at the esaul and Denisov one saw that the latter was wet and
55358. uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at the
55359. esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always
55360. and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was one
55361. with his horse, a being consequently possessed of twofold strength.
55362. 
55363. A little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and
55364. wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.
55365. 
55366. A little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghiz mount with an enormous
55367. tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue
55368. French overcoat.
55369. 
55370. Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and
55371. blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on to the
55372. hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him
55373. with surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.
55374. 
55375. Behind them along the narrow, sodden, cutup forest road came hussars in
55376. threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in French
55377. greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The horses,
55378. being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay.
55379. Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely
55380. thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, were all wet,
55381. slippery, and sodden, like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed
55382. the road. The men sat huddled up trying not to stir, so as to warm the
55383. water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold
55384. water that was leaking in under their seats, their knees, and at the
55385. back of their necks. In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two
55386. wagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had
55387. been hitched on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and
55388. splashed through the water that lay in the ruts.
55389. 
55390. Denisov's horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped
55391. his rider's knee against a tree.
55392. 
55393. "Oh, the devil!" exclaimed Denisov angrily, and showing his teeth he
55394. struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his
55395. comrades with mud.
55396. 
55397. Denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger
55398. (none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more because he
55399. still had no news from Dolokhov and the man sent to capture a "tongue"
55400. had not returned.
55401. 
55402. "There'll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today.
55403. It's too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it off till
55404. another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey
55405. from under our noses," thought Denisov, continually peering forward,
55406. hoping to see a messenger from Dolokhov.
55407. 
55408. On coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the
55409. right, Denisov stopped.
55410. 
55411. "There's someone coming," said he.
55412. 
55413. The esaul looked in the direction Denisov indicated.
55414. 
55415. "There are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not presupposable
55416. that it is the lieutenant colonel himself," said the esaul, who was fond
55417. of using words the Cossacks did not know.
55418. 
55419. The approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer
55420. visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary
55421. gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and
55422. drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,
55423. standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young
55424. lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Denisov
55425. and handed him a sodden envelope.
55426. 
55427. "From the general," said the officer. "Please excuse its not being quite
55428. dry."
55429. 
55430. Denisov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.
55431. 
55432. "There, they kept telling us: 'It's dangerous, it's dangerous,'"
55433. said the officer, addressing the esaul while Denisov was reading
55434. the dispatch. "But Komarov and I"--he pointed to the Cossack--"were
55435. prepared. We have each of us two pistols.... But what's this?" he asked,
55436. noticing the French drummer boy. "A prisoner? You've already been in
55437. action? May I speak to him?"
55438. 
55439. "Wostov! Petya!" exclaimed Denisov, having run through the dispatch.
55440. "Why didn't you say who you were?" and turning with a smile he held out
55441. his hand to the lad.
55442. 
55443. The officer was Petya Rostov.
55444. 
55445. All the way Petya had been preparing himself to behave with Denisov as
55446. befitted a grownup man and an officer--without hinting at their previous
55447. acquaintance. But as soon as Denisov smiled at him Petya brightened
55448. up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner he had been
55449. rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already been in a battle
55450. near Vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there.
55451. 
55452. "Well, I am glad to see you," Denisov interrupted him, and his face
55453. again assumed its anxious expression.
55454. 
55455. "Michael Feoklitych," said he to the esaul, "this is again fwom that
55456. German, you know. He"--he indicated Petya--"is serving under him."
55457. 
55458. And Denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a
55459. repetition of the German general's demand that he should join forces
55460. with him for an attack on the transport.
55461. 
55462. "If we don't take it tomowwow, he'll snatch it fwom under our noses," he
55463. added.
55464. 
55465. While Denisov was talking to the esaul, Petya--abashed by Denisov's
55466. cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his
55467. trousers--furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so
55468. that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air as
55469. possible.
55470. 
55471. "Will there be any orders, your honor?" he asked Denisov, holding his
55472. hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for
55473. which he had prepared himself, "or shall I remain with your honor?"
55474. 
55475. "Orders?" Denisov repeated thoughtfully. "But can you stay till
55476. tomowwow?"
55477. 
55478. "Oh, please... May I stay with you?" cried Petya.
55479. 
55480. "But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?" asked
55481. Denisov.
55482. 
55483. Petya blushed.
55484. 
55485. "He gave me no instructions. I think I could?" he returned, inquiringly.
55486. 
55487. "Well, all wight," said Denisov.
55488. 
55489. And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place
55490. arranged near the watchman's hut in the forest, and told the officer on
55491. the Kirghiz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and
55492. find out where Dolokhov was and whether he would come that evening.
55493. Denisov himself intended going with the esaul and Petya to the edge of
55494. the forest where it reached out to Shamshevo, to have a look at the part
55495. of the French bivouac they were to attack next day.
55496. 
55497. "Well, old fellow," said he to the peasant guide, "lead us to
55498. Shamshevo."
55499. 
55500. Denisov, Petya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the
55501. hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the
55502. edge of the forest.
55503. 
55504. 
55505. 
55506. 
55507. 
55508. CHAPTER V
55509. 
55510. 
55511. The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from
55512. the trees. Denisov, the esaul, and Petya rode silently, following the
55513. peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes
55514. and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves,
55515. silently led them to the edge of the forest.
55516. 
55517. He ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to where
55518. the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree that
55519. had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to
55520. them with his hand.
55521. 
55522. Denisov and Petya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant was
55523. standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, on a
55524. downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a steep
55525. ravine, was a small village and a landowner's house with a broken roof.
55526. In the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well, by the pond,
55527. over all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill from the
55528. bridge leading to the village, not more than five hundred yards
55529. away, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist. Their
55530. un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the
55531. carts, and their calls to one another, could be clearly heard.
55532. 
55533. "Bwing the prisoner here," said Denisov in a low voice, not taking his
55534. eyes off the French.
55535. 
55536. A Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to Denisov.
55537. Pointing to the French troops, Denisov asked him what these and those
55538. of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and
55539. lifting his eyebrows, looked at Denisov in affright, but in spite of
55540. an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers, merely
55541. assenting to everything Denisov asked him. Denisov turned away from him
55542. frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.
55543. 
55544. Petya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now
55545. at Denisov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village and
55546. along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.
55547. 
55548. "Whether Dolokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?" said Denisov with
55549. a merry sparkle in his eyes.
55550. 
55551. "It is a very suitable spot," said the esaul.
55552. 
55553. "We'll send the infantwy down by the swamps," Denisov continued.
55554. "They'll cweep up to the garden; you'll wide up fwom there with the
55555. Cossacks"--he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village--"and I
55556. with my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot..."
55557. 
55558. "The hollow is impassable--there's a swamp there," said the esaul. "The
55559. horses would sink. We must ride round more to the left...."
55560. 
55561. While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded
55562. from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then
55563. another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices
55564. shouting together came up from the slope. For a moment Denisov and the
55565. esaul drew back. They were so near that they thought they were the cause
55566. of the firing and shouting. But the firing and shouting did not relate
55567. to them. Down below, a man wearing something red was running through the
55568. marsh. The French were evidently firing and shouting at him.
55569. 
55570. "Why, that's our Tikhon," said the esaul.
55571. 
55572. "So it is! It is!"
55573. 
55574. "The wascal!" said Denisov.
55575. 
55576. "He'll get away!" said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.
55577. 
55578. The man whom they called Tikhon, having run to the stream, plunged in
55579. so that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared for an
55580. instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet, and ran on.
55581. The French who had been pursuing him stopped.
55582. 
55583. "Smart, that!" said the esaul.
55584. 
55585. "What a beast!" said Denisov with his former look of vexation. "What has
55586. he been doing all this time?"
55587. 
55588. "Who is he?" asked Petya.
55589. 
55590. "He's our plastun. I sent him to capture a 'tongue.'"
55591. 
55592. "Oh, yes," said Petya, nodding at the first words Denisov uttered as if
55593. he understood it all, though he really did not understand anything of
55594. it.
55595. 
55596. Tikhon Shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their band.
55597. He was a peasant from Pokrovsk, near the river Gzhat. When Denisov had
55598. come to Pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual
55599. summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French,
55600. the elder, as though shielding himself, had replied, as all village
55601. elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them. But
55602. when Denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the French, and
55603. asked if no French had strayed that way, the elder replied that some
55604. "more-orderers" had really been at their village, but that Tikhon
55605. Shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters. Denisov had
55606. Tikhon called and, having praised him for his activity, said a few words
55607. in the elder's presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country and
55608. the hatred of the French that all sons of the fatherland should cherish.
55609. 
55610. "We don't do the French any harm," said Tikhon, evidently frightened by
55611. Denisov's words. "We only fooled about with the lads for fun, you know!
55612. We killed a score or so of 'more-orderers,' but we did no harm else..."
55613. 
55614. Next day when Denisov had left Pokrovsk, having quite forgotten about
55615. this peasant, it was reported to him that Tikhon had attached himself
55616. to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it. Denisov gave
55617. orders to let him do so.
55618. 
55619. Tikhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching water,
55620. flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude
55621. for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for booty and always
55622. brought back French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring
55623. in French captives also. Denisov then relieved him from drudgery and
55624. began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him
55625. enrolled among the Cossacks.
55626. 
55627. Tikhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging
55628. behind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried
55629. rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses
55630. its teeth, with equal case picking fleas out of its fur or crunching
55631. thick bones. Tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at
55632. arm's length, or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs
55633. or carve spoons. In Denisov's party he held a peculiar and exceptional
55634. position. When anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be
55635. done--to push a cart out of the mud with one's shoulders, pull a horse
55636. out of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or walk
55637. more than thirty miles in a day--everybody pointed laughingly at Tikhon.
55638. 
55639. "It won't hurt that devil--he's as strong as a horse!" they said of him.
55640. 
55641. Once a Frenchman Tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him
55642. and shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which Tikhon
55643. treated only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the
55644. subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment--jokes in which
55645. Tikhon readily joined.
55646. 
55647. "Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?" the Cossacks would banter
55648. him. And Tikhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended to be
55649. angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect
55650. of this incident on Tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom
55651. brought in prisoners.
55652. 
55653. He was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found more
55654. opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more Frenchmen,
55655. and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars
55656. and willingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by Denisov
55657. overnight to Shamshevo to capture a "tongue." But whether because he
55658. had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept
55659. through the night, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the
55660. French and, as Denisov had witnessed from above, had been detected by
55661. them.
55662. 
55663. 
55664. 
55665. 
55666. 
55667. CHAPTER VI
55668. 
55669. 
55670. After talking for some time with the esaul about next day's attack,
55671. which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he seemed to have
55672. definitely decided on, Denisov turned his horse and rode back.
55673. 
55674. "Now, my lad, we'll go and get dwy," he said to Petya.
55675. 
55676. As they approached the watchhouse Denisov stopped, peering into the
55677. forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms,
55678. wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazan hat, was approaching
55679. with long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax
55680. stuck in his girdle. When he espied Denisov he hastily threw something
55681. into the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and
55682. approached his commander. It was Tikhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked
55683. face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He
55684. lifted his head high and gazed at Denisov as if repressing a laugh.
55685. 
55686. "Well, where did you disappear to?" inquired Denisov.
55687. 
55688. "Where did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen," answered Tikhon
55689. boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.
55690. 
55691. "Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well, why
55692. haven't you taken one?"
55693. 
55694. "Oh, I took one all right," said Tikhon.
55695. 
55696. "Where is he?"
55697. 
55698. "You see, I took him first thing at dawn," Tikhon continued, spreading
55699. out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes. "I took him
55700. into the forest. Then I see he's no good and think I'll go and fetch a
55701. likelier one."
55702. 
55703. "You see?... What a wogue--it's just as I thought," said Denisov to the
55704. esaul. "Why didn't you bwing that one?"
55705. 
55706. "What was the good of bringing him?" Tikhon interrupted hastily and
55707. angrily--"that one wouldn't have done for you. As if I don't know what
55708. sort you want!"
55709. 
55710. "What a bwute you are!... Well?"
55711. 
55712. "I went for another one," Tikhon continued, "and I crept like this
55713. through the wood and lay down." (He suddenly lay down on his stomach
55714. with a supple movement to show how he had done it.) "One turned up and
55715. I grabbed him, like this." (He jumped up quickly and lightly.) "'Come
55716. along to the colonel,' I said. He starts yelling, and suddenly there
55717. were four of them. They rushed at me with their little swords. So I went
55718. for them with my ax, this way: 'What are you up to?' says I. 'Christ
55719. be with you!'" shouted Tikhon, waving his arms with an angry scowl and
55720. throwing out his chest.
55721. 
55722. "Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the
55723. puddles!" said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.
55724. 
55725. Petya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained from
55726. laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from Tikhon's face to the esaul's
55727. and Denisov's, unable to make out what it all meant.
55728. 
55729. "Don't play the fool!" said Denisov, coughing angrily. "Why didn't you
55730. bwing the first one?"
55731. 
55732. Tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,
55733. then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,
55734. disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called
55735. Shcherbaty--the gap-toothed). Denisov smiled, and Petya burst into a
55736. peal of merry laughter in which Tikhon himself joined.
55737. 
55738. "Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing," said Tikhon. "The clothes
55739. on him--poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your honor! Why,
55740. he says: 'I'm a general's son myself, I won't go!' he says."
55741. 
55742. "You are a bwute!" said Denisov. "I wanted to question..."
55743. 
55744. "But I questioned him," said Tikhon. "He said he didn't know much.
55745. 'There are a lot of us,' he says, 'but all poor stuff--only soldiers
55746. in name,' he says. 'Shout loud at them,' he says, 'and you'll take
55747. them all,'" Tikhon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into
55748. Denisov's eyes.
55749. 
55750. "I'll give you a hundwed sharp lashes--that'll teach you to play the
55751. fool!" said Denisov severely.
55752. 
55753. "But why are you angry?" remonstrated Tikhon, "just as if I'd never seen
55754. your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and I'll fetch you any of
55755. them you want--three if you like."
55756. 
55757. "Well, let's go," said Denisov, and rode all the way to the watchhouse
55758. in silence and frowning angrily.
55759. 
55760. Tikhon followed behind and Petya heard the Cossacks laughing with him
55761. and at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes.
55762. 
55763. When the fit of laughter that had seized him at Tikhon's words and smile
55764. had passed and Petya realized for a moment that this Tikhon had killed a
55765. man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt
55766. a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted only a moment. He felt
55767. it necessary to hold his head higher, to brace himself, and to question
55768. the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrow's undertaking, that
55769. he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself.
55770. 
55771. The officer who had been sent to inquire met Denisov on the way with the
55772. news that Dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.
55773. 
55774. Denisov at once cheered up and, calling Petya to him, said: "Well, tell
55775. me about yourself."
55776. 
55777. 
55778. 
55779. 
55780. 
55781. CHAPTER VII
55782. 
55783. 
55784. Petya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, joined
55785. his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a
55786. large guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his commission,
55787. and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in
55788. the battle of Vyazma, Petya had been in a constant state of blissful
55789. excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to
55790. miss any chance to do something really heroic. He was highly delighted
55791. with what he saw and experienced in the army, but at the same time
55792. it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being
55793. performed just where he did not happen to be. And he was always in a
55794. hurry to get where he was not.
55795. 
55796. When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send
55797. somebody to Denisov's detachment, Petya begged so piteously to be sent
55798. that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he recalled
55799. Petya's mad action at the battle of Vyazma, where instead of riding by
55800. the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the
55801. advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired
55802. his pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any
55803. action whatever of Denisov's. That was why Petya had blushed and grown
55804. confused when Denisov asked him whether he could stay. Before they had
55805. ridden to the outskirts of the forest Petya had considered he must carry
55806. out his instructions strictly and return at once. But when he saw the
55807. French and saw Tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an
55808. attack that night, he decided, with the rapidity with which young people
55809. change their views, that the general, whom he had greatly respected till
55810. then, was a rubbishy German, that Denisov was a hero, the esaul a hero,
55811. and Tikhon a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave
55812. them at a moment of difficulty.
55813. 
55814. It was already growing dusk when Denisov, Petya, and the esaul rode up
55815. to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be seen, and
55816. Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and
55817. were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French
55818. could not see the smoke. In the passage of the small watchhouse a
55819. Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton. In the room
55820. three officers of Denisov's band were converting a door into a tabletop.
55821. Petya took off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, and at once began
55822. helping the officers to fix up the dinner table.
55823. 
55824. In ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the
55825. table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.
55826. 
55827. Sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton
55828. with his hands, down which the grease trickled, Petya was in an ecstatic
55829. childish state of love for all men, and consequently of confidence that
55830. others loved him in the same way.
55831. 
55832. "So then what do you think, Vasili Dmitrich?" said he to Denisov. "It's
55833. all right my staying a day with you?" And not waiting for a reply he
55834. answered his own question: "You see I was told to find out--well, I
55835. am finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the chief... I
55836. don't want a reward... But I want..."
55837. 
55838. Petya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head and
55839. flourishing his arms.
55840. 
55841. "Into the vewy chief..." Denisov repeated with a smile.
55842. 
55843. "Only, please let me command something, so that I may really command..."
55844. Petya went on. "What would it be to you?... Oh, you want a knife?" he
55845. said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton.
55846. 
55847. And he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.
55848. 
55849. "Please keep it. I have several like it," said Petya, blushing.
55850. "Heavens! I was quite forgetting!" he suddenly cried. "I have some
55851. raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler and
55852. he has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to something
55853. sweet. Would you like some?..." and Petya ran out into the passage to
55854. his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds
55855. of raisins. "Have some, gentlemen, have some!"
55856. 
55857. "You want a coffeepot, don't you?" he asked the esaul. "I bought a
55858. capital one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And he's very
55859. honest, that's the chief thing. I'll be sure to send it to you. Or
55860. perhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn out--that happens
55861. sometimes, you know. I have brought some with me, here they are"--and he
55862. showed a bag--"a hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please take
55863. as many as you want, or all if you like...."
55864. 
55865. Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, Petya stopped and
55866. blushed.
55867. 
55868. He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was
55869. foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered the French
55870. drummer boy. "It's capital for us here, but what of him? Where have they
55871. put him? Have they fed him? Haven't they hurt his feelings?" he thought.
55872. But having caught himself saying too much about the flints, he was now
55873. afraid to speak out.
55874. 
55875. "I might ask," he thought, "but they'll say: 'He's a boy himself and so
55876. he pities the boy.' I'll show them tomorrow whether I'm a boy. Will it
55877. seem odd if I ask?" Petya thought. "Well, never mind!" and immediately,
55878. blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared
55879. ironical, he said:
55880. 
55881. "May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to
55882. eat?... Perhaps..."
55883. 
55884. "Yes, he's a poor little fellow," said Denisov, who evidently saw
55885. nothing shameful in this reminder. "Call him in. His name is Vincent
55886. Bosse. Have him fetched."
55887. 
55888. "I'll call him," said Petya.
55889. 
55890. "Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow," Denisov repeated.
55891. 
55892. Petya was standing at the door when Denisov said this. He slipped in
55893. between the officers, came close to Denisov, and said:
55894. 
55895. "Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!"
55896. 
55897. And having kissed Denisov he ran out of the hut.
55898. 
55899. "Bosse! Vincent!" Petya cried, stopping outside the door.
55900. 
55901. "Who do you want, sir?" asked a voice in the darkness.
55902. 
55903. Petya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that
55904. day.
55905. 
55906. "Ah, Vesenny?" said a Cossack.
55907. 
55908. Vincent, the boy's name, had already been changed by the Cossacks into
55909. Vesenny (vernal) and into Vesenya by the peasants and soldiers. In both
55910. these adaptations the reference to spring (vesna) matched the impression
55911. made by the young lad.
55912. 
55913. "He is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, Vesenya!
55914. Vesenya!--Vesenny!" laughing voices were heard calling to one another in
55915. the darkness.
55916. 
55917. "He's a smart lad," said an hussar standing near Petya. "We gave him
55918. something to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!"
55919. 
55920. The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the
55921. darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.
55922. 
55923. "Ah, c'est vous!" said Petya. "Voulez-vous manger? N'ayez pas peur, on
55924. ne vous fera pas de mal," * he added shyly and affectionately, touching
55925. the boy's hand. "Entrez, entrez." *(2)
55926. 
55927. 
55928.      * "Ah, it's you! Do you want something to eat? Don't be
55929.      afraid, they won't hurt you."
55930. 
55931.      * (2) "Come in, come in."
55932. 
55933. 
55934. "Merci, monsieur," * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish
55935. voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.
55936. 
55937. 
55938.     * "Thank you, sir."
55939. 
55940. 
55941. There were many things Petya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but did
55942. not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then in
55943. the darkness he took the boy's hand and pressed it.
55944. 
55945. "Come in, come in!" he repeated in a gentle whisper. "Oh, what can I do
55946. for him?" he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.
55947. 
55948. When the boy had entered the hut, Petya sat down at a distance from
55949. him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. But
55950. he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem
55951. ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.
55952. 
55953. 
55954. 
55955. 
55956. 
55957. CHAPTER VIII
55958. 
55959. 
55960. The arrival of Dolokhov diverted Petya's attention from the drummer boy,
55961. to whom Denisov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom he had had
55962. dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and
55963. not sent away with the other prisoners. Petya had heard in the army many
55964. stories of Dolokhov's extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the
55965. French, so from the moment he entered the hut Petya did not take his
55966. eyes from him, but braced himself up more and more and held his head
55967. high, that he might not be unworthy even of such company.
55968. 
55969. Dolokhov's appearance amazed Petya by its simplicity.
55970. 
55971. Denisov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas the
55972. Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and everything he
55973. did indicated his unusual position. But Dolokhov, who in Moscow had worn
55974. a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most correct officer of
55975. the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman's padded coat with
55976. an Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set
55977. straight on his head. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of
55978. the room, and without greeting anyone went up to Denisov and began
55979. questioning him about the matter in hand. Denisov told him of the
55980. designs the large detachments had on the transport, of the message Petya
55981. had brought, and his own replies to both generals. Then he told him all
55982. he knew of the French detachment.
55983. 
55984. "That's so. But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,"
55985. said Dolokhov. "It will be necessary to go there. We can't start the
55986. affair without knowing for certain how many there are. I like to work
55987. accurately. Here now--wouldn't one of these gentlemen like to ride over
55988. to the French camp with me? I have brought a spare uniform."
55989. 
55990. "I, I... I'll go with you!" cried Petya.
55991. 
55992. "There's no need for you to go at all," said Denisov, addressing
55993. Dolokhov, "and as for him, I won't let him go on any account."
55994. 
55995. "I like that!" exclaimed Petya. "Why shouldn't I go?"
55996. 
55997. "Because it's useless."
55998. 
55999. "Well, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and that's
56000. all. You'll take me, won't you?" he said, turning to Dolokhov.
56001. 
56002. "Why not?" Dolokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of the
56003. French drummer boy. "Have you had that youngster with you long?" he
56004. asked Denisov.
56005. 
56006. "He was taken today but he knows nothing. I'm keeping him with me."
56007. 
56008. "Yes, and where do you put the others?" inquired Dolokhov.
56009. 
56010. "Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for them," shouted Denisov,
56011. suddenly flushing. "And I say boldly that I have not a single man's life
56012. on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or
56013. thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of staining--I speak
56014. bluntly--staining the honor of a soldier?"
56015. 
56016. "That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of
56017. sixteen," said Dolokhov with cold irony, "but it's time for you to drop
56018. it."
56019. 
56020. "Why, I've not said anything! I only say that I'll certainly go with
56021. you," said Petya shyly.
56022. 
56023. "But for you and me, old fellow, it's time to drop these amenities,"
56024. continued Dolokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of
56025. this subject which irritated Denisov. "Now, why have you kept this lad?"
56026. he went on, swaying his head. "Because you are sorry for him! Don't we
56027. know those 'receipts' of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty
56028. get there. The rest either starve or get killed. So isn't it all the
56029. same not to send them?"
56030. 
56031. The esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.
56032. 
56033. "That's not the point. I'm not going to discuss the matter. I do not
56034. wish to take it on my conscience. You say they'll die. All wight. Only
56035. not by my fault!"
56036. 
56037. Dolokhov began laughing.
56038. 
56039. "Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if
56040. they did catch me they'd string me up to an aspen tree, and with all
56041. your chivalry just the same." He paused. "However, we must get to work.
56042. Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms in it.
56043. Well, are you coming with me?" he asked Petya.
56044. 
56045. "I? Yes, yes, certainly!" cried Petya, blushing almost to tears and
56046. glancing at Denisov.
56047. 
56048. While Dolokhov had been disputing with Denisov what should be done with
56049. prisoners, Petya had once more felt awkward and restless; but again he
56050. had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about. "If grown-up,
56051. distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and right," thought he.
56052. "But above all Denisov must not dare to imagine that I'll obey him and
56053. that he can order me about. I will certainly go to the French camp with
56054. Dolokhov. If he can, so can I!"
56055. 
56056. And to all Denisov's persuasions, Petya replied that he too was
56057. accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that he
56058. never considered personal danger.
56059. 
56060. "For you'll admit that if we don't know for sure how many of them there
56061. are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two
56062. of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go, so don't
56063. hinder me," said he. "It will only make things worse..."
56064. 
56065. 
56066. 
56067. 
56068. 
56069. CHAPTER IX
56070. 
56071. 
56072. Having put on French greatcoats and shakos, Petya and Dolokhov rode to
56073. the clearing from which Denisov had reconnoitered the French camp,
56074. and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the
56075. hollow. On reaching the bottom, Dolokhov told the Cossacks accompanying
56076. him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the
56077. bridge. Petya, his heart in his mouth with excitement, rode by his side.
56078. 
56079. "If we're caught, I won't be taken alive! I have a pistol," whispered
56080. he.
56081. 
56082. "Don't talk Russian," said Dolokhov in a hurried whisper, and at that
56083. very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: "Qui vive?" *
56084. and the click of a musket.
56085. 
56086. 
56087.     * "Who goes there?"
56088. 
56089. 
56090. The blood rushed to Petya's face and he grasped his pistol.
56091. 
56092. "Lanciers du 6-me," * replied Dolokhov, neither hastening nor slackening
56093. his horse's pace.
56094. 
56095. 
56096.     * "Lancers of the 6th Regiment."
56097. 
56098. 
56099. The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.
56100. 
56101. "Mot d'ordre." *
56102. 
56103. 
56104.     * "Password."
56105. 
56106. 
56107. Dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.
56108. 
56109. "Dites donc, le colonel Gerard est ici?" * he asked.
56110. 
56111. 
56112.     * "Tell me, is Colonel Gerard here?"
56113. 
56114. 
56115. "Mot d'ordre," repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not replying.
56116. 
56117. "Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas le
56118. mot d'ordre..." cried Dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight
56119. at the sentinel. "Je vous demande si le colonel est ici." *
56120. 
56121. 
56122.      * "When an officer is making his round, sentinels don't ask
56123.      him for the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is
56124.      here."
56125. 
56126. 
56127. And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped
56128. aside, Dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk.
56129. 
56130. Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dolokhov stopped
56131. him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The man,
56132. a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to
56133. Dolokhov's horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in
56134. a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up
56135. the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called the
56136. landowner's house.
56137. 
56138. Having ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk could be
56139. heard around the campfires, Dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the
56140. landowner's house. Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a
56141. big blazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily.
56142. Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and
56143. a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was
56144. kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.
56145. 
56146. "Oh, he's a hard nut to crack," said one of the officers who was sitting
56147. in the shadow at the other side of the fire.
56148. 
56149. "He'll make them get a move on, those fellows!" said another, laughing.
56150. 
56151. Both fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of
56152. Dolokhov's and Petya's steps as they advanced to the fire leading their
56153. horses.
56154. 
56155. "Bonjour, messieurs!" * said Dolokhov loudly and clearly.
56156. 
56157. 
56158.     * "Good day, gentlemen."
56159. 
56160. 
56161. There was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire,
56162. and one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up to
56163. Dolokhov.
56164. 
56165. "Is that you, Clement?" he asked. "Where the devil...?" But, noticing
56166. his mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted Dolokhov as a
56167. stranger, asking what he could do for him.
56168. 
56169. Dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their
56170. regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew
56171. anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, and Petya
56172. thought the officers were beginning to look at him and Dolokhov with
56173. hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were silent.
56174. 
56175. "If you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too late," said
56176. a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.
56177. 
56178. Dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that
56179. night.
56180. 
56181. He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and
56182. squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long
56183. neck. That officer did not take his eyes from Dolokhov and again asked
56184. to what regiment he belonged. Dolokhov, as if he had not heard the
56185. question, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe which he took
56186. from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them
56187. was safe from Cossacks.
56188. 
56189. "Those brigands are everywhere," replied an officer from behind the
56190. fire.
56191. 
56192. Dolokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers
56193. such as his companion and himself, "but probably they would not dare to
56194. attack large detachments?" he added inquiringly. No one replied.
56195. 
56196. "Well, now he'll come away," Petya thought every moment as he stood by
56197. the campfire listening to the talk.
56198. 
56199. But Dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began
56200. putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion,
56201. how many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about the Russian
56202. prisoners with that detachment, Dolokhov said:
56203. 
56204. "A horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would be
56205. better to shoot such rabble," and burst into loud laughter, so strange
56206. that Petya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise,
56207. and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.
56208. 
56209. No one replied a word to Dolokhov's laughter, and a French officer whom
56210. they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and whispered
56211. something to a companion. Dolokhov got up and called to the soldier who
56212. was holding their horses.
56213. 
56214. "Will they bring our horses or not?" thought Petya, instinctively
56215. drawing nearer to Dolokhov.
56216. 
56217. The horses were brought.
56218. 
56219. "Good evening, gentlemen," said Dolokhov.
56220. 
56221. Petya wished to say "Good night" but could not utter a word. The
56222. officers were whispering together. Dolokhov was a long time mounting
56223. his horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at a
56224. footpace. Petya rode beside him, longing to look round to see whether or
56225. not the French were running after them, but not daring to.
56226. 
56227. Coming out onto the road Dolokhov did not ride back across the open
56228. country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and listened.
56229. "Do you hear?" he asked. Petya recognized the sound of Russian voices
56230. and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires.
56231. When they had descended to the bridge Petya and Dolokhov rode past the
56232. sentinel, who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then
56233. they descended into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.
56234. 
56235. "Well now, good-by. Tell Denisov, 'at the first shot at daybreak,'" said
56236. Dolokhov and was about to ride away, but Petya seized hold of him.
56237. 
56238. "Really!" he cried, "you are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how splendid!
56239. How I love you!"
56240. 
56241. "All right, all right!" said Dolokhov. But Petya did not let go of him
56242. and Dolokhov saw through the gloom that Petya was bending toward him and
56243. wanted to kiss him. Dolokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and
56244. vanished into the darkness.
56245. 
56246. 
56247. 
56248. 
56249. 
56250. CHAPTER X
56251. 
56252. 
56253. Having returned to the watchman's hut, Petya found Denisov in the
56254. passage. He was awaiting Petya's return in a state of agitation,
56255. anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.
56256. 
56257. "Thank God!" he exclaimed. "Yes, thank God!" he repeated, listening to
56258. Petya's rapturous account. "But, devil take you, I haven't slept because
56259. of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still get a nap before
56260. morning."
56261. 
56262. "But... no," said Petya, "I don't want to sleep yet. Besides I know
56263. myself, if I fall asleep it's finished. And then I am used to not
56264. sleeping before a battle."
56265. 
56266. He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his
56267. expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day.
56268. 
56269. Then, noticing that Denisov was asleep, he rose and went out of doors.
56270. 
56271. It was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were still
56272. falling from the trees. Near the watchman's hut the black shapes of the
56273. Cossacks' shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen. Behind
56274. the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them
56275. were discernible, and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red.
56276. Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and there, amid the
56277. sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by, could be
56278. heard low voices which seemed to be whispering.
56279. 
56280. Petya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.
56281. Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses
56282. munching their oats. In the dark Petya recognized his own horse, which
56283. he called "Karabakh" though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.
56284. 
56285. "Well, Karabakh! We'll do some service tomorrow," said he, sniffing its
56286. nostrils and kissing it.
56287. 
56288. "Why aren't you asleep, sir?" said a Cossack who was sitting under a
56289. wagon.
56290. 
56291. "No, ah... Likhachev--isn't that your name? Do you know I have only just
56292. come back! We've been into the French camp."
56293. 
56294. And Petya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but
56295. also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life
56296. than to act "just anyhow."
56297. 
56298. "Well, you should get some sleep now," said the Cossack.
56299. 
56300. "No, I am used to this," said Petya. "I say, aren't the flints in your
56301. pistols worn out? I brought some with me. Don't you want any? You can
56302. have some."
56303. 
56304. The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at
56305. Petya.
56306. 
56307. "Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately," said Petya.
56308. "Some fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and then
56309. they're sorry for it afterwards. I don't like that."
56310. 
56311. "Just so," said the Cossack.
56312. 
56313. "Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my
56314. saber for me? It's got bl..." (Petya feared to tell a lie, and the saber
56315. never had been sharpened.) "Can you do it?"
56316. 
56317. "Of course I can."
56318. 
56319. Likhachev got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon Petya heard the warlike
56320. sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its
56321. edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.
56322. 
56323. "I say! Are the lads asleep?" asked Petya.
56324. 
56325. "Some are, and some aren't--like us."
56326. 
56327. "Well, and that boy?"
56328. 
56329. "Vesenny? Oh, he's thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast asleep
56330. after his fright. He was that glad!"
56331. 
56332. After that Petya remained silent for a long time, listening to the
56333. sounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared.
56334. 
56335. "What are you sharpening?" asked a man coming up to the wagon.
56336. 
56337. "Why, this gentleman's saber."
56338. 
56339. "That's right," said the man, whom Petya took to be an hussar. "Was the
56340. cup left here?"
56341. 
56342. "There, by the wheel!"
56343. 
56344. The hussar took the cup.
56345. 
56346. "It must be daylight soon," said he, yawning, and went away.
56347. 
56348. Petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denisov's
56349. guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon
56350. captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under
56351. it Likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark
56352. blotch to the right was the watchman's hut, and the red blotch below to
56353. the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had come
56354. for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor
56355. waited to know anything of all this. He was in a fairy kingdom where
56356. nothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be the
56357. watchman's hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of
56358. the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the eye of an
56359. enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon, but it might
56360. very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high
56361. tower from which, if he fell, he would have to fall for a whole day or a
56362. whole month, or go on falling and never reach the bottom. Perhaps it
56363. was just the Cossack, Likhachev, who was sitting under the wagon, but it
56364. might be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in the
56365. world, whom no one knew of. It might really have been that the hussar
56366. came for water and went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply
56367. vanished--disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness.
56368. 
56369. Nothing Petya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was in a
56370. fairy kingdom where everything was possible.
56371. 
56372. He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth.
56373. It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly
56374. sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if the clouds
56375. were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as
56376. if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising
56377. high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that one could
56378. touch it with one's hand.
56379. 
56380. Petya's eyes began to close and he swayed a little.
56381. 
56382. The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed and
56383. jostled one another. Someone snored.
56384. 
56385. "Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg..." hissed the saber against the whetstone,
56386. and suddenly Petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown,
56387. sweetly solemn hymn. Petya was as musical as Natasha and more so than
56388. Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the
56389. melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly
56390. fresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody
56391. grew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was
56392. a fugue--though Petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is.
56393. Each instrument--now resembling a violin and now a horn, but better
56394. and clearer than violin or horn--played its own part, and before it had
56395. finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the
56396. same air, and then with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into
56397. one and again became separate and again blended, now into solemn church
56398. music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.
56399. 
56400. "Oh--why, that was in a dream!" Petya said to himself, as he lurched
56401. forward. "It's in my ears. But perhaps it's music of my own. Well, go
56402. on, my music! Now!..."
56403. 
56404. He closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance, sounds
56405. fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again all
56406. mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. "Oh, this is delightful!
56407. As much as I like and as I like!" said Petya to himself. He tried to
56408. conduct that enormous orchestra.
56409. 
56410. "Now softly, softly die away!" and the sounds obeyed him. "Now fuller,
56411. more joyful. Still more and more joyful!" And from an unknown depth rose
56412. increasingly triumphant sounds. "Now voices join in!" ordered Petya. And
56413. at first from afar he heard men's voices and then women's. The voices
56414. grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and Petya listened to their
56415. surpassing beauty in awe and joy.
56416. 
56417. With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from the
56418. trees, and the hissing of the saber, "Ozheg-zheg-zheg..." and again the
56419. horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the choir but
56420. joining in it.
56421. 
56422. Petya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all the
56423. time, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to
56424. share it. He was awakened by Likhachev's kindly voice.
56425. 
56426. "It's ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!"
56427. 
56428. Petya woke up.
56429. 
56430. "It's getting light, it's really getting light!" he exclaimed.
56431. 
56432. The horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their
56433. very tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches.
56434. Petya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it
56435. to Likhachev; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed
56436. it. The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle
56437. girths.
56438. 
56439. "And here's the commander," said Likhachev.
56440. 
56441. Denisov came out of the watchman's hut and, having called Petya, gave
56442. orders to get ready.
56443. 
56444. 
56445. 
56446. 
56447. 
56448. CHAPTER XI
56449. 
56450. 
56451. The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness, tightened
56452. their saddle girths, and formed companies. Denisov stood by the
56453. watchman's hut giving final orders. The infantry of the detachment
56454. passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist
56455. of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through the mud. The esaul
56456. gave some orders to his men. Petya held his horse by the bridle,
56457. impatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face, having been bathed
56458. in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant.
56459. Cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.
56460. 
56461. "Well, is ev'wything weady?" asked Denisov. "Bwing the horses."
56462. 
56463. The horses were brought. Denisov was angry with the Cossack because the
56464. saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted. Petya put his
56465. foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but
56466. Petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and,
56467. turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode
56468. up to Denisov.
56469. 
56470. "Vasili Dmitrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for God's
56471. sake...!" said he.
56472. 
56473. Denisov seemed to have forgotten Petya's very existence. He turned to
56474. glance at him.
56475. 
56476. "I ask one thing of you," he said sternly, "to obey me and not shove
56477. yourself forward anywhere."
56478. 
56479. He did not say another word to Petya but rode in silence all the way.
56480. When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing
56481. light over the field. Denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and
56482. the Cossacks rode past Petya and Denisov. When they had all ridden by,
56483. Denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill. Slipping onto their
56484. haunches and sliding, the horses descended with their riders into the
56485. ravine. Petya rode beside Denisov, the pulsation of his body constantly
56486. increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid
56487. distant objects. Having reached the valley, Denisov looked back and
56488. nodded to a Cossack beside him.
56489. 
56490. "The signal!" said he.
56491. 
56492. The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the tramp
56493. of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from various sides,
56494. and then more shots.
56495. 
56496. At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Petya lashed his
56497. horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Denisov who
56498. shouted at him. It seemed to Petya that at the moment the shot was
56499. fired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge.
56500. Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the bridge
56501. he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on.
56502. In front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were running from right
56503. to left across the road. One of them fell in the mud under his horse's
56504. feet.
56505. 
56506. Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the midst
56507. of that crowd terrible screams arose. Petya galloped up, and the
56508. first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman,
56509. clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.
56510. 
56511. "Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!" shouted Petya, and giving rein to his
56512. excited horse he galloped forward along the village street.
56513. 
56514. He could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged
56515. Russian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road,
56516. were shouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking
56517. Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face,
56518. had been defending himself against the hussars. When Petya galloped
56519. up the Frenchman had already fallen. "Too late again!" flashed through
56520. Petya's mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing
56521. could be heard. The shots came from the yard of the landowner's house
56522. he had visited the night before with Dolokhov. The French were making
56523. a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with
56524. bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who crowded at the gateway.
56525. Through the smoke, as he approached the gate, Petya saw Dolokhov, whose
56526. face was of a pale-greenish tint, shouting to his men. "Go round! Wait
56527. for the infantry!" he exclaimed as Petya rode up to him.
56528. 
56529. "Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!" shouted Petya, and without pausing a moment
56530. galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the
56531. smoke was thickest.
56532. 
56533. A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others plashed
56534. against something. The Cossacks and Dolokhov galloped after Petya into
56535. the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the
56536. French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the
56537. Cossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the pond. Petya was
56538. galloping along the courtyard, but instead of holding the reins he waved
56539. both his arms about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther
56540. to one side in his saddle. His horse, having galloped up to a campfire
56541. that was smoldering in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and Petya
56542. fell heavily on to the wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and
56543. legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had
56544. pierced his skull.
56545. 
56546. After speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house
56547. with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that
56548. they surrendered, Dolokhov dismounted and went up to Petya, who lay
56549. motionless with outstretched arms.
56550. 
56551. "Done for!" he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet Denisov
56552. who was riding toward him.
56553. 
56554. "Killed?" cried Denisov, recognizing from a distance the unmistakably
56555. lifeless attitude--very familiar to him--in which Petya's body was
56556. lying.
56557. 
56558. "Done for!" repeated Dolokhov as if the utterance of these words
56559. afforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who
56560. were surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. "We won't take them!" he
56561. called out to Denisov.
56562. 
56563. Denisov did not reply; he rode up to Petya, dismounted, and with
56564. trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered
56565. face which had already gone white.
56566. 
56567. "I am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!" he
56568. recalled Petya's words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise at the
56569. sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which Denisov turned away, walked to
56570. the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.
56571. 
56572. Among the Russian prisoners rescued by Denisov and Dolokhov was Pierre
56573. Bezukhov.
56574. 
56575. 
56576. 
56577. 
56578. 
56579. CHAPTER XII
56580. 
56581. 
56582. During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been
56583. issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners
56584. among whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October that party was
56585. no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left
56586. Moscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first
56587. stages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other half had gone
56588. on ahead. Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in
56589. front of the prisoners was left; they had all disappeared. The artillery
56590. the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was
56591. now replaced by Marshal Junot's enormous baggage train, convoyed by
56592. Westphalians. Behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.
56593. 
56594. From Vyazma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in three
56595. columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder that Pierre
56596. had noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now
56597. reached the utmost limit.
56598. 
56599. The road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead
56600. horses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments
56601. continually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again
56602. lagging behind it.
56603. 
56604. Several times during the march false alarms had been given and the
56605. soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run
56606. headlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and
56607. abused each other for their causeless panic.
56608. 
56609. These three groups traveling together--the cavalry stores, the convoy of
56610. prisoners, and Junot's baggage train--still constituted a separate and
56611. united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.
56612. 
56613. Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and
56614. twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been
56615. captured or left behind. Some of Junot's wagons also had been captured
56616. or abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers
56617. from Davout's corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that
56618. a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the
56619. prisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had been
56620. shot by the marshal's own order because a silver spoon belonging to the
56621. marshal had been found in his possession.
56622. 
56623. The group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three hundred
56624. and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now
56625. remained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the
56626. cavalry saddles or Junot's baggage. They understood that the saddles and
56627. Junot's spoon might be of some use, but that cold and hungry soldiers
56628. should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who
56629. froze and lagged behind on the road (in which case the order was to
56630. shoot them) was not merely incomprehensible but revolting. And the
56631. escort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition they themselves were in,
56632. of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering
56633. their own plight still worse, treated them with particular moroseness
56634. and severity.
56635. 
56636. At Dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the
56637. prisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores, several
56638. of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away, but were
56639. recaptured by the French and shot.
56640. 
56641. The arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners
56642. should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned.
56643. All who could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had
56644. rejoined Karataev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen
56645. Karataev for its master.
56646. 
56647. On the third day after leaving Moscow Karataev again fell ill with the
56648. fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he grew
56649. gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know why, but
56650. since Karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to
56651. go near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which
56652. Karataev generally lay down at the halting places, and when he smelled
56653. the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before, Pierre
56654. moved farther away and did not think about him.
56655. 
56656. While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his intellect
56657. but with his whole being, by life itself, that man is created for
56658. happiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfaction of simple
56659. human needs, and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from
56660. superfluity. And now during these last three weeks of the march he had
56661. learned still another new, consolatory truth--that nothing in this world
56662. is terrible. He had learned that as there is no condition in which man
56663. can be happy and entirely free, so there is no condition in which he
56664. need be unhappy and lack freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom
56665. have their limits and that those limits are very near together; that the
56666. person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as
56667. he now, sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled
56668. while the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing
56669. shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet
56670. that were covered with sores--his footgear having long since fallen to
56671. pieces. He discovered that when he had married his wife--of his own free
56672. will as it had seemed to him--he had been no more free than now
56673. when they locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself
56674. subsequently termed his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely
56675. felt, the worst was the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet.
56676. (The horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of
56677. the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant; there was
56678. no great cold, it was always warm walking in the daytime, and at night
56679. there were the campfires; the lice that devoured him warmed his body.)
56680. The one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet.
56681. 
56682. After the second day's march Pierre, having examined his feet by the
56683. campfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when
56684. everybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,
56685. walked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more
56686. terrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now,
56687. but thought of other things.
56688. 
56689. Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the
56690. saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing
56691. to another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows
56692. superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit.
56693. 
56694. He did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged
56695. behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did not
56696. think of Karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon
56697. have to share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about himself. The
56698. harder his position became and the more terrible the future, the more
56699. independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful
56700. and comforting thoughts, memories, and imaginings that came to him.
56701. 
56702. 
56703. 
56704. 
56705. 
56706. CHAPTER XIII
56707. 
56708. 
56709. At midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill along
56710. the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the roughness of
56711. the way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and
56712. then again at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar
56713. and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side
56714. of the road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction
56715. lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three, and then again going on
56716. all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion. The
56717. dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow. All around lay
56718. the flesh of different animals--from men to horses--in various stages
56719. of decomposition; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the
56720. dog could eat all it wanted.
56721. 
56722. It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it
56723. might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began raining
56724. harder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed the water,
56725. which ran along the ruts in streams.
56726. 
56727. Pierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps in
56728. threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally addressing the
56729. rain, he repeated: "Now then, now then, go on! Pelt harder!"
56730. 
56731. It seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and
56732. deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and
56733. comforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a
56734. conversation with Karataev the day before.
56735. 
56736. At their yesterday's halting place, feeling chilly by a dying campfire,
56737. Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was burning better.
56738. There Platon Karataev was sitting covered up--head and all--with
56739. his greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his
56740. effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre knew. It
56741. was already past midnight, the hour when Karataev was usually free of
56742. his fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the fire and
56743. heard Platon's voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic face
56744. brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart. His
56745. feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away,
56746. but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look at
56747. Platon.
56748. 
56749. "Well, how are you?" he asked.
56750. 
56751. "How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won't grant us death," replied
56752. Platon, and at once resumed the story he had begun.
56753. 
56754. "And so, brother," he continued, with a smile on his pale emaciated face
56755. and a particularly happy light in his eyes, "you see, brother..."
56756. 
56757. Pierre had long been familiar with that story. Karataev had told it
56758. to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful
56759. emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that tale as to
56760. something new, and the quiet rapture Karataev evidently felt as he told
56761. it communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was of an old merchant
56762. who lived a good and God-fearing life with his family, and who went once
56763. to the Nizhni fair with a companion--a rich merchant.
56764. 
56765. Having put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning his
56766. companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained knife
56767. was found under the old merchant's pillow. He was tried, knouted, and
56768. his nostrils having been torn off, "all in due form" as Karataev put it,
56769. he was sent to hard labor in Siberia.
56770. 
56771. "And so, brother" (it was at this point that Pierre came up), "ten years
56772. or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict, submitting as
56773. he should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one
56774. night the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among
56775. them. And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they
56776. had sinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had
56777. taken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply
56778. been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: 'What
56779. are you being punished for, Daddy?'--'I, my dear brothers,' said he, 'am
56780. being punished for my own and other men's sins. But I have not killed
56781. anyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my
56782. poorer brothers. I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much
56783. property. 'And he went on to tell them all about it in due order. 'I
56784. don't grieve for myself,' he says, 'God, it seems, has chastened me.
56785. Only I am sorry for my old wife and the children,' and the old man began
56786. to weep. Now it happened that in the group was the very man who had
56787. killed the other merchant. 'Where did it happen, Daddy?' he said. 'When,
56788. and in what month?' He asked all about it and his heart began to ache.
56789. So he comes up to the old man like this, and falls down at his feet!
56790. 'You are perishing because of me, Daddy,' he says. 'It's quite true,
56791. lads, that this man,' he says, 'is being tortured innocently and for
56792. nothing! I,' he says, 'did that deed, and I put the knife under your
56793. head while you were asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,' he says, 'for Christ's
56794. sake!'"
56795. 
56796. Karataev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and he drew
56797. the logs together.
56798. 
56799. "And the old man said, 'God will forgive you, we are all sinners in His
56800. sight. I suffer for my own sins,' and he wept bitter tears. Well,
56801. and what do you think, dear friends?" Karataev continued, his face
56802. brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had
56803. to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story:
56804. "What do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the
56805. authorities. 'I have taken six lives,' he says (he was a great sinner),
56806. 'but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don't let him suffer
56807. because of me.' So he confessed and it was all written down and the
56808. papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while
56809. they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the
56810. papers all in due form--the authorities I mean--time passed. The affair
56811. reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar's decree came: to set the
56812. merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded. The
56813. paper arrived and they began to look for the old man. 'Where is the old
56814. man who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A paper has come from
56815. the Tsar!' so they began looking for him," here Karataev's lower jaw
56816. trembled, "but God had already forgiven him--he was dead! That's how it
56817. was, dear fellows!" Karataev concluded and sat for a long time silent,
56818. gazing before him with a smile.
56819. 
56820. And Pierre's soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself
56821. but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up
56822. Karataev's face as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy.
56823. 
56824. 
56825. 
56826. 
56827. 
56828. CHAPTER XIV
56829. 
56830. 
56831. "A vos places!" * suddenly cried a voice.
56832. 
56833. 
56834.     * "To your places."
56835. 
56836. 
56837. A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something
56838. joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the
56839. prisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left came
56840. smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the prisoners at a
56841. trot. The expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the
56842. approach of those in authority. The prisoners thronged together and were
56843. pushed off the road. The convoy formed up.
56844. 
56845. "The Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!" and hardly had the
56846. sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled
56847. by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a
56848. tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of the
56849. marshals. His eye fell on Pierre's large and striking figure, and in
56850. the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he
56851. detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.
56852. 
56853. The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a
56854. red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several officers
56855. formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their faces all
56856. looked excited and worried.
56857. 
56858. "What did he say? What did he say?" Pierre heard them ask.
56859. 
56860. While the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in a
56861. crowd, and Pierre saw Karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning.
56862. He sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On his face,
56863. besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling
56864. the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently, there was now an
56865. expression of quiet solemnity.
56866. 
56867. Karataev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with
56868. tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to
56869. him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he
56870. did not notice that look and moved hastily away.
56871. 
56872. When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. Karataev
56873. was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two
56874. Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look round again
56875. but went limping up the hill.
56876. 
56877. From behind, where Karataev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot.
56878. Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he
56879. had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to
56880. Smolensk--a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And
56881. he again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of
56882. whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and
56883. in the expression on their faces--one of them glanced timidly at
56884. Pierre--there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of
56885. the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and
56886. remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt while
56887. drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.
56888. 
56889. Behind him, where Karataev had been sitting, the dog began to howl.
56890. "What a stupid beast! Why is it howling?" thought Pierre.
56891. 
56892. His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking
56893. back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling,
56894. just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces.
56895. 
56896. 
56897. 
56898. 
56899. 
56900. CHAPTER XV
56901. 
56902. 
56903. The stores, the prisoners, and the marshal's baggage train stopped at
56904. the village of Shamshevo. The men crowded together round the campfires.
56905. Pierre went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh, lay down with his
56906. back to the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He again slept as he had
56907. done at Mozhaysk after the battle of Borodino.
56908. 
56909. Again real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or another,
56910. gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that had
56911. been expressed in his dream at Mozhaysk.
56912. 
56913. "Life is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and that
56914. movement is God. And while there is life there is joy in consciousness
56915. of the divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and more blessed
56916. than all else is to love this life in one's sufferings, in innocent
56917. sufferings."
56918. 
56919. "Karataev!" came to Pierre's mind.
56920. 
56921. And suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly old man
56922. who had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. "Wait a bit,"
56923. said the old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was alive--a
56924. vibrating ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface consisted of
56925. drops closely pressed together, and all these drops moved and changed
56926. places, sometimes several of them merging into one, sometimes one
56927. dividing into many. Each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much
56928. space as possible, but others striving to do the same compressed it,
56929. sometimes destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.
56930. 
56931. "That is life," said the old teacher.
56932. 
56933. "How simple and clear it is," thought Pierre. "How is it I did not know
56934. it before?"
56935. 
56936. "God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect
56937. Him to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from the
56938. surface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges. There now, Karataev
56939. has spread out and disappeared. Do you understand, my child?" said the
56940. teacher.
56941. 
56942. "Do you understand, damn you?" shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.
56943. 
56944. He lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian
56945. soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting a piece
56946. of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy,
56947. hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod. His
56948. brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of
56949. the charcoal.
56950. 
56951. "It's all the same to him," he muttered, turning quickly to a soldier
56952. who stood behind him. "Brigand! Get away!"
56953. 
56954. And twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned
56955. away and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier the
56956. Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting something
56957. with his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized the blue-gray dog,
56958. sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.
56959. 
56960. "Ah, he's come?" said Pierre. "And Plat-" he began, but did not finish.
56961. 
56962. Suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy--of
56963. the look Platon had given him as he sat under the tree, of the shot
56964. heard from that spot, of the dog's howl, of the guilty faces of the two
56965. Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and of
56966. Karataev's absence at this halt--and he was on the point of realizing
56967. that Karataev had been killed, but just at that instant, he knew not
56968. why, the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent
56969. with a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And
56970. without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion
56971. from them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a vision of the country in
56972. summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating
56973. globe, and he sank into water so that it closed over his head.
56974. 
56975. Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing.
56976. French soldiers were running past him.
56977. 
56978. "The Cossacks!" one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of
56979. Russians surrounded Pierre.
56980. 
56981. For a long time he could not understand what was happening to him. All
56982. around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.
56983. 
56984. "Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!" old soldiers exclaimed, weeping, as
56985. they embraced Cossacks and hussars.
56986. 
56987. The hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one offered them
56988. clothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed as he sat
56989. among them and could not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier who
56990. approached him, and kissed him, weeping.
56991. 
56992. Dolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd
56993. of disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had
56994. happened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed
56995. Dolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them
56996. with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became silent. On the
56997. opposite side stood Dolokhov's Cossack, counting the prisoners and
56998. marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate.
56999. 
57000. "How many?" Dolokhov asked the Cossack.
57001. 
57002. "The second hundred," replied the Cossack.
57003. 
57004. "Filez, filez!" * Dolokhov kept saying, having adopted this expression
57005. from the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they
57006. flashed with a cruel light.
57007. 
57008. 
57009.     * "Get along, get along!"
57010. 
57011. 
57012. Denisov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks
57013. who were carrying the body of Petya Rostov to a hole that had been dug
57014. in the garden.
57015. 
57016. 
57017. 
57018. 
57019. 
57020. CHAPTER XVI
57021. 
57022. 
57023. After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight of
57024. the French assumed a still more tragic character, with men freezing,
57025. or roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while carriages
57026. with people dressed in furs continued to drive past, carrying away the
57027. property that had been stolen by the Emperor, kings, and dukes; but
57028. the process of the flight and disintegration of the French army went on
57029. essentially as before.
57030. 
57031. From Moscow to Vyazma the French army of seventy-three thousand men not
57032. reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but pillage)
57033. was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five thousand
57034. had fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding terms of the
57035. progression could be determined mathematically. The French army melted
57036. away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to Vyazma, from Vyazma
57037. to Smolensk, from Smolensk to the Berezina, and from the Berezina to
57038. Vilna--independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold,
57039. the pursuit, the barring of the way, or any other particular conditions.
57040. Beyond Vyazma the French army instead of moving in three columns huddled
57041. together into one mass, and so went on to the end. Berthier wrote to his
57042. Emperor (we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge
57043. from the truth in describing the condition of an army) and this is what
57044. he said:
57045. 
57046. 
57047. I deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the various
57048. corps I have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last
57049. two or three days' march. They are almost disbanded. Scarcely a quarter
57050. of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments, the others
57051. go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and
57052. escape discipline. In general they regard Smolensk as the place where
57053. they hope to recover. During the last few days many of the men have been
57054. seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms. In such a state
57055. of affairs, whatever your ultimate plans may be, the interest of Your
57056. Majesty's service demands that the army should be rallied at Smolensk
57057. and should first of all be freed from ineffectives, such as dismounted
57058. cavalry, unnecessary baggage, and artillery material that is no longer
57059. in proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, who are worn out with
57060. hunger and fatigue, need these supplies as well as a few days' rest.
57061. Many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This
57062. state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that
57063. unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under
57064. control in case of an engagement.
57065. 
57066. November 9: twenty miles from Smolensk.
57067. 
57068. 
57069. After staggering into Smolensk which seemed to them a promised land, the
57070. French, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own stores,
57071. and when everything had been plundered fled farther.
57072. 
57073. They all went without knowing whither or why they were going. Still less
57074. did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any orders to
57075. him. But still he and those about him retained their old habits: wrote
57076. commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; called one another
57077. sire, mon cousin, prince d'Eckmuhl, roi de Naples, and so on. But these
57078. orders and reports were only on paper, nothing in them was acted upon
57079. for they could not be carried out, and though they entitled one
57080. another Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, they all felt that they were
57081. miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to
57082. pay. And though they pretended to be concerned about the army, each
57083. was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save
57084. himself.
57085. 
57086.

57088.

57090. CHAPTER XVII
57091. 
57092. 
57093. The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign
57094. from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian
57095. blindman's bluff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of
57096. them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his
57097. whereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into
57098. a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to
57099. escape runs straight into his opponent's arms.
57100. 
57101. At first while they were still moving along the Kaluga road, Napoleon's
57102. armies made their presence known, but later when they reached the
57103. Smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight--and
57104. often thinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.
57105. 
57106. Owing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit
57107. and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means
57108. of approximately ascertaining the enemy's position--by cavalry
57109. scouting--was not available. Besides, as a result of the frequent
57110. and rapid change of position by each army, even what information was
57111. obtained could not be delivered in time. If news was received one day
57112. that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before, by the
57113. third day when something could have been done, that army was already two
57114. days' march farther on and in quite another position.
57115. 
57116. One army fled and the other pursued. Beyond Smolensk there were several
57117. different roads available for the French, and one would have thought
57118. that during their stay of four days they might have learned where
57119. the enemy was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan and
57120. undertaken something new. But after a four days' halt the mob, with no
57121. maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither
57122. to the right nor to the left but along the old--the worst--road, through
57123. Krasnoe and Orsha.
57124. 
57125. Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French separated
57126. in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours. In
57127. front of them all fled the Emperor, then the kings, then the dukes. The
57128. Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right
57129. beyond the Dnieper--which was the only reasonable thing for him to
57130. do--themselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at
57131. Krasnoe. And here as in a game of blindman's buff the French ran into
57132. our vanguard. Seeing their enemy unexpectedly the French fell into
57133. confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright, but then they
57134. resumed their flight, abandoning their comrades who were farther behind.
57135. Then for three days separate portions of the French army--first Murat's
57136. (the vice-king's), then Davout's, and then Ney's--ran, as it were, the
57137. gauntlet of the Russian army. They abandoned one another, abandoned
57138. all their heavy baggage, their artillery, and half their men, and fled,
57139. getting past the Russians by night by making semicircles to the right.
57140. 
57141. Ney, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of
57142. Smolensk which were in nobody's way, because despite the unfortunate
57143. plight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor
57144. against which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of ten
57145. thousand men, reached Napoleon at Orsha with only one thousand men left,
57146. having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having crossed the
57147. Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.
57148. 
57149. From Orsha they fled farther along the road to Vilna, still playing
57150. at blindman's buff with the pursuing army. At the Berezina they again
57151. became disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those
57152. who got across the river fled farther. Their supreme chief donned a
57153. fur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone,
57154. abandoning his companions. The others who could do so drove away too,
57155. leaving those who could not to surrender or die.
57156. 
57157. 
57158. 
57159. 
57160. 
57161. CHAPTER XVIII
57162. 
57163. 
57164. This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which they did
57165. all they could to destroy themselves. From the time they turned onto
57166. the Kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the army, none of the
57167. movements of the crowd had any sense. So one might have thought that
57168. regarding this period of the campaign the historians, who attributed
57169. the actions of the mass to the will of one man, would have found it
57170. impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory. But
57171. no! Mountains of books have been written by the historians about this
57172. campaign, and everywhere are described Napoleon's arrangements, the
57173. maneuvers, and his profound plans which guided the army, as well as the
57174. military genius shown by his marshals.
57175. 
57176. The retreat from Malo-Yaroslavets when he had a free road into a
57177. well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along
57178. which Kutuzov afterwards pursued him--this unnecessary retreat along
57179. a devastated road--is explained to us as being due to profound
57180. considerations. Similarly profound considerations are given for
57181. his retreat from Smolensk to Orsha. Then his heroism at Krasnoe is
57182. described, where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle
57183. and take personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick
57184. and said:
57185. 
57186. "J'ai assez fait l'empereur; il est temps de faire le general," * but
57187. nevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the
57188. scattered fragments of the army he left behind.
57189. 
57190. 
57191.      * "I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act
57192.      the general."
57193. 
57194. 
57195. Then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals, especially
57196. of Ney--a greatness of soul consisting in this: that he made his way by
57197. night around through the forest and across the Dnieper and escaped to
57198. Orsha, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths of his men.
57199. 
57200. And lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic
57201. army is presented to us by the historians as something great and
57202. characteristic of genius. Even that final running away, described in
57203. ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child
57204. is taught to be ashamed of--even that act finds justification in the
57205. historians' language.
57206. 
57207. When it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical
57208. ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly contrary to all
57209. that humanity calls right or even just, the historians produce a saving
57210. conception of "greatness." "Greatness," it seems, excludes the standards
57211. of right and wrong. For the "great" man nothing is wrong, there is no
57212. atrocity for which a "great" man can be blamed.
57213. 
57214. "C'est grand!" * say the historians, and there no longer exists either
57215. good or evil but only "grand" and "not grand." Grand is good, not
57216. grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of some
57217. special animals called "heroes." And Napoleon, escaping home in a warm
57218. fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades
57219. but were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que c'est
57220. grand, *(2) and his soul is tranquil.
57221. 
57222. 
57223.      * "It is great."
57224. 
57225.      * (2) That it is great.
57226. 
57227. 
57228. "Du sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il n'y
57229. a qu'un pas," * said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been
57230. repeating: "Sublime! Grand! Napoleon le Grand!" Du sublime au ridicule
57231. il n'y a qu'un pas.
57232. 
57233. 
57234.     * "From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step."
57235. 
57236. 
57237. And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with
57238. the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one's own nothingness
57239. and immeasurable meanness.
57240. 
57241. For us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no human
57242. actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where simplicity,
57243. goodness, and truth are absent.
57244.

57247. 
57248. 
57249. CHAPTER XIX
57250. 
57251. 
57252. What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign
57253. of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret,
57254. dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is
57255. that the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies
57256. surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered French, hungry
57257. and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the historians relate)
57258. the aim of the Russians was to stop the French, to cut them off, and
57259. capture them all?
57260. 
57261. How was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than the
57262. French had given battle at Borodino, did not achieve its purpose when it
57263. had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture
57264. them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us that when we had
57265. surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them? How could
57266. that happen?
57267. 
57268. History (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions
57269. says that this occurred because Kutuzov and Tormasov and Chichagov, and
57270. this man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers...
57271. 
57272. But why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were
57273. guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and
57274. punished? But even if we admitted that Kutuzov, Chichagov, and others
57275. were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still incomprehensible
57276. why, the position of the Russian army being what it was at Krasnoe and
57277. at the Berezina (in both cases we had superior forces), the French army
57278. with its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not captured, if that was what
57279. the Russians aimed at.
57280. 
57281. The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military
57282. historians (to the effect that Kutuzov hindered an attack) is unfounded,
57283. for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at
57284. Vyazma and Tarutino.
57285. 
57286. Why was the Russian army--which with inferior forces had withstood the
57287. enemy in full strength at Borodino--defeated at Krasnoe and the Berezina
57288. by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically
57289. superior?
57290. 
57291. If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing
57292. Napoleon and his marshals--and that aim was not merely frustrated but
57293. all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled--then this last
57294. period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a
57295. series of victories, and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian
57296. historians.
57297. 
57298. The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims
57299. of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical
57300. rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit
57301. that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for
57302. Napoleon and defeats for Kutuzov.
57303. 
57304. But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a
57305. conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French
57306. victories brought the French complete destruction, while the series
57307. of Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the
57308. liberation of their country.
57309. 
57310. The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians
57311. studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals,
57312. from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, have attributed to this
57313. last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of
57314. cutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army.
57315. 
57316. There never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been
57317. senseless and its attainment quite impossible.
57318. 
57319. It would have been senseless, first because Napoleon's disorganized
57320. army was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that is to say, was
57321. doing just what every Russian desired. So what was the use of performing
57322. various operations on the French who were running away as fast as they
57323. possibly could?
57324. 
57325. Secondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose
57326. whole energy was directed to flight.
57327. 
57328. Thirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one's own troops in
57329. order to destroy the French army, which without external interference
57330. was destroying itself at such a rate that, though its path was not
57331. blocked, it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually
57332. did in December, namely a hundredth part of the original army.
57333. 
57334. Fourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the
57335. Emperor, kings, and dukes--whose capture would have been in the highest
57336. degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit diplomatists of
57337. the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. Still more senseless
57338. would have been the wish to capture army corps of the French, when our
57339. own army had melted away to half before reaching Krasnoe and a whole
57340. division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners, and
57341. when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners
57342. already taken were perishing of hunger.
57343. 
57344. All the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his
57345. army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving out of
57346. his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should
57347. run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The only thing to be said
57348. in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry. But not even
57349. that could be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not
57350. they who had suffered from the trampled beds.
57351. 
57352. But besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have
57353. been senseless, it was impossible.
57354. 
57355. It was impossible first because--as experience shows that a three-mile
57356. movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans--the
57357. probability of Chichagov, Kutuzov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction
57358. on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to
57359. impossibility, as in fact thought Kutuzov, who when he received the plan
57360. remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the
57361. desired results.
57362. 
57363. Secondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with which
57364. Napoleon's army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than the
57365. Russians possessed would have been required.
57366. 
57367. Thirdly it was impossible, because the military term "to cut off" has no
57368. meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. To cut
57369. off an army--to bar its road--is quite impossible, for there is always
57370. plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can
57371. be seen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the
57372. example of Krasnoe and of the Berezina. It is only possible to capture
57373. prisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it is only possible
57374. to catch a swallow if it settles on one's hand. Men can only be taken
57375. prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and
57376. tactics, as the Germans did. But the French troops quite rightly did not
57377. consider that this suited them, since death by hunger and cold awaited
57378. them in flight or captivity alike.
57379. 
57380. Fourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the world
57381. began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained
57382. in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its
57383. strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying
57384. itself.
57385. 
57386. During the movement of the Russian army from Tarutino to Krasnoe it
57387. lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to the
57388. population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of the army
57389. without a battle.
57390. 
57391. And it is of this period of the campaign--when the army lacked boots
57392. and sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and
57393. was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees
57394. of frost, when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and
57395. the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be
57396. maintained, when men were taken into that region of death where
57397. discipline fails, not for a few hours only as in a battle, but for
57398. months, where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and
57399. cold, when half the army perished in a single month--it is of this
57400. period of the campaign that the historians tell us how Miloradovich
57401. should have made a flank march to such and such a place, Tormasov to
57402. another place, and Chichagov should have crossed (more than knee-deep
57403. in snow) to somewhere else, and how so-and-so "routed" and "cut off" the
57404. French and so on and so on.
57405. 
57406. The Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should have been
57407. done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not to blame
57408. because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed that they should
57409. do what was impossible.
57410. 
57411. All that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the
57412. facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians
57413. dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words
57414. and sentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.
57415. 
57416. To them the words of Miloradovich seem very interesting, and so do their
57417. surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question
57418. of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves
57419. does not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of
57420. their investigation.
57421. 
57422. Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and
57423. consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a
57424. direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed insoluble
57425. easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.
57426. 
57427. The aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in
57428. the imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it was
57429. senseless and unattainable.
57430. 
57431. The people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion. That aim
57432. was attained in the first place of itself, as the French ran away,
57433. and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight. Secondly it was
57434. attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the French, and
57435. thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was following the French,
57436. ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped.
57437. 
57438. The Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. And the
57439. experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a
57440. menace than to strike the running animal on the head.

57452. CHAPTER I
57453. 
57454. 
57455. When seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror: substance
57456. similar to his own is perishing before his eyes. But when it is a
57457. beloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this horror at
57458. the extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual wound, which
57459. like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals, but always
57460. aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch.
57461. 
57462. After Prince Andrew's death Natasha and Princess Mary alike felt this.
57463. Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of
57464. death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the face. They
57465. carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact.
57466. Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street, a summons to
57467. dinner, the maid's inquiry what dress to prepare, or worse still any
57468. word of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully
57469. irritated the wound, interrupting that necessary quiet in which
57470. they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still
57471. resounded in their imagination, and hindered their gazing into those
57472. mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before
57473. them.
57474. 
57475. Only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain.
57476. They spoke little even to one another, and when they did it was of very
57477. unimportant matters.
57478. 
57479. Both avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of
57480. a future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did
57481. they avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them that
57482. what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in
57483. words, and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the
57484. majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before
57485. their eyes.
57486. 
57487. Continued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of everything
57488. that might lead up to the subject--this halting on all sides at the
57489. boundary of what they might not mention--brought before their minds with
57490. still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling.
57491. 
57492. But pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy.
57493. Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of
57494. her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was the first to
57495. be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt
57496. for the first fortnight. She received letters from her relations to
57497. which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put
57498. was damp and he began to cough; Alpatych came to Yaroslavl with reports
57499. on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they
57500. should return to Moscow to the house on the Vozdvizhenka Street, which
57501. had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs. Life did not
57502. stand still and it was necessary to live. Hard as it was for Princess
57503. Mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she
57504. had lived till then, and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave
57505. Natasha alone, yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she
57506. involuntarily yielded to them. She went through the accounts with
57507. Alpatych, conferred with Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and
57508. made preparations for the journey to Moscow.
57509. 
57510. Natasha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making
57511. preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.
57512. 
57513. Princess Mary asked the countess to let Natasha go with her to Moscow,
57514. and both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw their daughter
57515. losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the
57516. advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.
57517. 
57518. "I am not going anywhere," Natasha replied when this was proposed to
57519. her. "Do please just leave me alone!" And she ran out of the room, with
57520. difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than
57521. of sorrow.
57522. 
57523. After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief,
57524. Natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself, sitting huddled
57525. up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and twisting
57526. something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and
57527. fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This solitude exhausted
57528. and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it. As soon as anyone
57529. entered she got up quickly, changed her position and expression, and
57530. picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting impatiently for the
57531. intruder to go.
57532. 
57533. She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that
57534. on which--with a terrible questioning too great for her strength--her
57535. spiritual gaze was fixed.
57536. 
57537. One day toward the end of December Natasha, pale and thin, dressed in a
57538. black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot, was
57539. crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously crumpling and
57540. smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the
57541. door.
57542. 
57543. She was gazing in the direction in which he had gone--to the other side
57544. of life. And that other side of life, of which she had never before
57545. thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable,
57546. was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of
57547. life, where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering
57548. and indignity.
57549. 
57550. She was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine him
57551. otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he had been
57552. at Mytishchi, at Troitsa, and at Yaroslavl.
57553. 
57554. She saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own, and
57555. sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.
57556. 
57557. There he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning
57558. his head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his
57559. shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and a
57560. wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs twitches
57561. just perceptibly, but rapidly. Natasha knows that he is struggling with
57562. terrible pain. "What is that pain like? Why does he have that pain? What
57563. does he feel? How does it hurt him?" thought Natasha. He noticed her
57564. watching him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seriously:
57565. 
57566. "One thing would be terrible," said he: "to bind oneself forever to a
57567. suffering man. It would be continual torture." And he looked searchingly
57568. at her. Natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what
57569. she would say. She said: "This can't go on--it won't. You will get
57570. well--quite well."
57571. 
57572. She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she
57573. had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at those words
57574. and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted
57575. gaze.
57576. 
57577. "I agreed," Natasha now said to herself, "that it would be dreadful if
57578. he always continued to suffer. I said it then only because it would have
57579. been dreadful for him, but he understood it differently. He thought it
57580. would be dreadful for me. He then still wished to live and feared death.
57581. And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I meant.
57582. I thought quite differently. Had I said what I thought, I should have
57583. said: even if he had to go on dying, to die continually before my eyes,
57584. I should have been happy compared with what I am now. Now there is
57585. nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No, he did not and never will know
57586. it. And now it will never, never be possible to put it right." And
57587. now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her, only in her
57588. imagination Natasha this time gave him a different answer. She stopped
57589. him and said: "Terrible for you, but not for me! You know that for me
57590. there is nothing in life but you, and to suffer with you is the greatest
57591. happiness for me," and he took her hand and pressed it as he had
57592. pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death. And in her
57593. imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have
57594. said then but only spoke now: "I love thee!... thee! I love, love..."
57595. she said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a
57596. desperate effort...
57597. 
57598. She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her
57599. eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.
57600. Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again with a
57601. strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And now, now
57602. it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at the instant
57603. when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a
57604. loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears. Dunyasha,
57605. her maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look
57606. on her face and showing no concern for her mistress.
57607. 
57608. "Come to your Papa at once, please!" said she with a strange, excited
57609. look. "A misfortune... about Peter Ilynich... a letter," she finished
57610. with a sob.
57611. 
57612. 
57613. 
57614. 
57615. 
57616. CHAPTER II
57617. 
57618. 
57619. Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Natasha was feeling
57620. a special estrangement from the members of her own family. All of
57621. them--her father, mother, and Sonya--were so near to her, so familiar,
57622. so commonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to
57623. the world in which she had been living of late, and she felt not
57624. merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility. She heard
57625. Dunyasha's words about Peter Ilynich and a misfortune, but did not grasp
57626. them.
57627. 
57628. "What misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? They just live
57629. their own old, quiet, and commonplace life," thought Natasha.
57630. 
57631. As she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of
57632. her mother's room. His face was puckered up and wet with tears. He
57633. had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were
57634. choking him. When he saw Natasha he waved his arms despairingly and
57635. burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face.
57636. 
57637. "Pe... Petya... Go, go, she... is calling..." and weeping like a child
57638. and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost fell into
57639. it, covering his face with his hands.
57640. 
57641. Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through Natasha's whole being.
57642. Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache as if
57643. something was being torn inside her and she were dying. But the pain
57644. was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive
57645. constraint that had prevented her taking part in life. The sight of her
57646. father, the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the
57647. door, made her immediately forget herself and her own grief.
57648. 
57649. She ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing to her
57650. mother's door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, came out
57651. from that room and taking Natasha by the arm said something to her.
57652. Natasha neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid steps, pausing
57653. at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself, and then ran
57654. to her mother.
57655. 
57656. The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position,
57657. stretching out and beating her head against the wall. Sonya and the
57658. maids were holding her arms.
57659. 
57660. "Natasha! Natasha!..." cried the countess. "It's not true... it's not
57661. true... He's lying... Natasha!" she shrieked, pushing those around her
57662. away. "Go away, all of you; it's not true! Killed!... ha, ha, ha!...
57663. It's not true!"
57664. 
57665. Natasha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother, embraced
57666. her, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned her face toward
57667. herself, and clung to her.
57668. 
57669. "Mummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy," she kept on
57670. whispering, not pausing an instant.
57671. 
57672. She did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her,
57673. demanded a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore open her
57674. mother's dress.
57675. 
57676. "My dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!..." she whispered
57677. incessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her own
57678. irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.
57679. 
57680. The countess pressed her daughter's hand, closed her eyes, and became
57681. quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness,
57682. glanced vacantly around her, and seeing Natasha began to press her
57683. daughter's head with all her strength. Then she turned toward her
57684. daughter's face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it.
57685. 
57686. "Natasha, you love me?" she said in a soft trustful whisper. "Natasha,
57687. you would not deceive me? You'll tell me the whole truth?"
57688. 
57689. Natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was
57690. nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.
57691. 
57692. "My darling Mummy!" she repeated, straining all the power of her love to
57693. find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her
57694. mother.
57695. 
57696. And again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing to
57697. believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom
57698. of life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.
57699. 
57700. Natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the
57701. next day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave her mother. Her
57702. persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess
57703. every moment, not explaining or consoling, but recalling her to life.
57704. 
57705. During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes,
57706. and Natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes,
57707. but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was
57708. sitting up in bed and speaking softly.
57709. 
57710. "How glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won't you have some tea?"
57711. Natasha went up to her. "You have improved in looks and grown more
57712. manly," continued the countess, taking her daughter's hand.
57713. 
57714. "Mamma! What are you saying..."
57715. 
57716. "Natasha, he is no more, no more!"
57717. 
57718. And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first
57719. time.
57720. 
57721. 
57722. 
57723. 
57724. 
57725. CHAPTER III
57726. 
57727. 
57728. Princess Mary postponed her departure. Sonya and the count tried to
57729. replace Natasha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to
57730. restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks Natasha
57731. remained constantly at her mother's side, sleeping on a lounge chair
57732. in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly
57733. because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her
57734. mother.
57735. 
57736. The mother's wounded spirit could not heal. Petya's death had torn from
57737. her half her life. When the news of Petya's death had come she had been
57738. a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room
57739. a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that
57740. almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored Natasha to life.
57741. 
57742. A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like
57743. a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may
57744. heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet
57745. heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within.
57746. 
57747. Natasha's wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended,
57748. but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of
57749. life--love--was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life.
57750. 
57751. Prince Andrew's last days had bound Princess Mary and Natasha together;
57752. this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary
57753. put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Natasha as if
57754. she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother's bedroom
57755. had strained Natasha's physical strength.
57756. 
57757. One afternoon noticing Natasha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took
57758. her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Natasha lay down,
57759. but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she
57760. called her back.
57761. 
57762. "I don't want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little."
57763. 
57764. "You are tired--try to sleep."
57765. 
57766. "No, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me."
57767. 
57768. "She is much better. She spoke so well today," said Princess Mary.
57769. 
57770. Natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned
57771. Princess Mary's face.
57772. 
57773. "Is she like him?" thought Natasha. "Yes, like and yet not like. But she
57774. is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What
57775. is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What
57776. does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!"
57777. 
57778. "Mary," she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary's hand to herself,
57779. "Mary, you mustn't think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love you!
57780. Let us be quite, quite friends."
57781. 
57782. And Natasha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making
57783. Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings.
57784. 
57785. From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only
57786. between women was established between Princess Mary and Natasha. They
57787. were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and
57788. spent most of their time together. When one went out the other became
57789. restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony
57790. with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A
57791. feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive
57792. feeling of life being possible only in each other's presence.
57793. 
57794. Sometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were already
57795. in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They spoke most
57796. of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her childhood, of her
57797. mother, her father, and her daydreams; and Natasha, who with a passive
57798. lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of
57799. devotion, submission, and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice, now
57800. feeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection, learned to love her
57801. past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to
57802. her. She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her
57803. own life, for she was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood
57804. and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues. For
57805. Princess Mary, listening to Natasha's tales of childhood and early
57806. youth, there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of
57807. life: belief in life and its enjoyment.
57808. 
57809. Just as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they
57810. thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him had
57811. the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being
57812. conscious of it.
57813. 
57814. Natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all
57815. talked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was
57816. suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness,
57817. and loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm
57818. carefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her
57819. drawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed to
57820. her that things must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.
57821. 
57822. One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.
57823. Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and
57824. then, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.
57825. 
57826. Another time when she called Dunyasha her voice trembled, so she called
57827. again--though she could hear Dunyasha coming--called her in the deep
57828. chest tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened attentively
57829. to herself.
57830. 
57831. She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer
57832. of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate
57833. young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so
57834. cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that
57835. it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound had begun to heal
57836. from within.
57837. 
57838. At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count
57839. insisted on Natasha's going with her to consult the doctors.
57840. 
57841. 
57842. 
57843. 
57844. 
57845. CHAPTER IV
57846. 
57847. 
57848. After the encounter at Vyazma, where Kutuzov had been unable to hold
57849. back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and
57850. so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians
57851. who pursued them, continued as far as Krasnoe without a battle. The
57852. flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could
57853. not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke down, and the
57854. information received of the movements of the French was never reliable.
57855. 
57856. The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching
57857. at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any
57858. faster.
57859. 
57860. To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only
57861. necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not
57862. losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarutino and
57863. less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a
57864. hundred thousand strong reached Krasnoe with only fifty thousand.
57865. 
57866. The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army
57867. as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference was that
57868. the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction
57869. as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind
57870. in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their
57871. own people. The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon's army was
57872. the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the
57873. corresponding decrease of the Russian army.
57874. 
57875. Kutuzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the
57876. movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian
57877. army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at
57878. Tarutino and Vyazma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our
57879. army.
57880. 
57881. But besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the
57882. army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, another
57883. reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to Kutuzov.
57884. The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French. The road the
57885. French would take was unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on
57886. their heels the greater distance they had to cover. Only by following
57887. at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French. All
57888. the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of
57889. the army and a lengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable
57890. aim was to shorten those marches. To that end Kutuzov's activity was
57891. directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to Vilna--not casually or
57892. intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it.
57893. 
57894. Kutuzov felt and knew--not by reasoning or science but with the whole of
57895. his Russian being--what every Russian soldier felt: that the French were
57896. beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the
57897. same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march,
57898. the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year.
57899. 
57900. But to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army,
57901. who wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for some
57902. reason to capture a king or a duke--it seemed that now--when any battle
57903. must be horrible and senseless--was the very time to fight and conquer
57904. somebody. Kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after
57905. another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those
57906. soldiers--ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved--who within a
57907. month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number,
57908. and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater
57909. distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the
57910. frontier.
57911. 
57912. This longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and
57913. to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on
57914. the French army.
57915. 
57916. So it was at Krasnoe, where they expected to find one of the three
57917. French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen
57918. thousand men. Despite all Kutuzov's efforts to avoid that ruinous
57919. encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob
57920. of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Krasnoe for three
57921. days.
57922. 
57923. Toll wrote a disposition: "The first column will march to so and so,"
57924. etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition.
57925. Prince Eugene of Wurttemberg fired from a hill over the French crowds
57926. that were running past, and demanded reinforcements which did not
57927. arrive. The French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and hid themselves
57928. in the forest by night, making their way round as best they could, and
57929. continued their flight.
57930. 
57931. Miloradovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the
57932. commissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found when
57933. he was wanted--that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche * as he styled
57934. himself--who was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys demanding
57935. their surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was ordered to do.
57936. 
57937. 
57938.     * Knight without fear and without reproach.
57939. 
57940. 
57941. "I give you that column, lads," he said, riding up to the troops and
57942. pointing out the French to the cavalry.
57943. 
57944. And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could
57945. scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented
57946. to them--that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,
57947. frost-bitten, and starving--and the column that had been presented to
57948. them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to
57949. do.
57950. 
57951. At Krasnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several hundred
57952. cannon, and a stick called a "marshal's staff," and disputed as to
57953. who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their
57954. achievement--though they much regretted not having taken Napoleon, or at
57955. least a marshal or a hero of some sort, and reproached one another and
57956. especially Kutuzov for having failed to do so.
57957. 
57958. These men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of the
57959. most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes and
57960. imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable
57961. deed. They blamed Kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the
57962. campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he thought of
57963. nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen
57964. Factories because he was comfortable there, that at Krasnoe he checked
57965. the advance because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite
57966. lost his head, and that it was probable that he had an understanding
57967. with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on.
57968. 
57969. Not only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk
57970. in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as grand,
57971. while Kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak
57972. old courtier, and by Russians as something indefinite--a sort of puppet
57973. useful only because he had a Russian name.
57974. 
57975. 
57976. 
57977. 
57978. 
57979. CHAPTER V
57980. 
57981. 
57982. In 1812 and 1813 Kutuzov was openly accused of blundering. The Emperor
57983. was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written by order
57984. of the Highest Authorities it is said that Kutuzov was a cunning court
57985. liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by his blunders at
57986. Krasnoe and the Berezina he deprived the Russian army of the glory of
57987. complete victory over the French. *
57988. 
57989. 
57990.      * History of the year 1812. The character of Kutuzov and
57991.      reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at
57992.      Krasnoe, by Bogdanovich.
57993. 
57994. 
57995. Such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian mind
57996. does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary individuals
57997. who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their personal will to
57998. it. The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning
57999. the higher laws.
58000. 
58001. For Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon--that most
58002. insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile, showed
58003. human dignity--Napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he
58004. is grand. But Kutuzov--the man who from the beginning to the end of his
58005. activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed from Borodino to
58006. Vilna, presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice
58007. and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was
58008. happening--Kutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful, and
58009. when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little
58010. ashamed.
58011. 
58012. And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose
58013. activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be
58014. difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the
58015. will of the whole people. Still more difficult would it be to find
58016. an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so
58017. completely accomplished as that to which all Kutuzov's efforts were
58018. directed in 1812.
58019. 
58020. Kutuzov never talked of "forty centuries looking down from the
58021. Pyramids," of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of
58022. what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he said
58023. nothing about himself, adopted no prose, always appeared to be the
58024. simplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most
58025. ordinary things. He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de
58026. Stael, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with
58027. generals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who tried
58028. to prove anything to him. When Count Rostopchin at the Yauza bridge
58029. galloped up to Kutuzov with personal reproaches for having caused the
58030. destruction of Moscow, and said: "How was it you promised not to abandon
58031. Moscow without a battle?" Kutuzov replied: "And I shall not abandon
58032. Moscow without a battle," though Moscow was then already abandoned. When
58033. Arakcheev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that Ermolov ought to
58034. be appointed chief of the artillery, Kutuzov replied: "Yes, I was
58035. just saying so myself," though a moment before he had said quite the
58036. contrary. What did it matter to him--who then alone amid a senseless
58037. crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was
58038. happening--what did it matter to him whether Rostopchin attributed the
58039. calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it matter to
58040. him who was appointed chief of the artillery.
58041. 
58042. Not merely in these cases but continually did that old man--who by
58043. experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the
58044. words serving as their expression are not what move people--use quite
58045. meaningless words that happened to enter his head.
58046. 
58047. But that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole
58048. time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim
58049. toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of
58050. himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real
58051. thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood.
58052. Beginning with the battle of Borodino, from which time his disagreement
58053. with those about him began, he alone said that the battle of Borodino
58054. was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches
58055. and reports up to the time of his death. He alone said that the loss of
58056. Moscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to Lauriston's proposal of
58057. peace, he said: There can be no peace, for such is the people's will. He
58058. alone during the retreat of the French said that all our maneuvers are
58059. useless, everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could
58060. desire; that the enemy must be offered "a golden bridge"; that neither
58061. the Tarutino, the Vyazma, nor the Krasnoe battles were necessary; that
58062. we must keep some force to reach the frontier with, and that he would
58063. not sacrifice a single Russian for ten Frenchmen.
58064. 
58065. And this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakcheev
58066. to please the Emperor, he alone--incurring thereby the Emperor's
58067. displeasure--said in Vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is
58068. useless and harmful.
58069. 
58070. Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the
58071. events. His actions--without the smallest deviation--were all directed
58072. to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength for
58073. conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them out
58074. of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people
58075. and of our army.
58076. 
58077. This procrastinator Kutuzov, whose motto was "Patience and Time,"
58078. this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodino, investing the
58079. preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kutuzov who before
58080. the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in
58081. contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that Borodino
58082. was a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was
58083. lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after
58084. winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat
58085. insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought,
58086. and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia
58087. crossed.
58088. 
58089. It is easy now to understand the significance of these events--if
58090. only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that
58091. existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals--for the events and
58092. results now lie before us.
58093. 
58094. But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion,
58095. so truly discern the importance of the people's view of the events that
58096. in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?
58097. 
58098. The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the
58099. events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in
58100. full purity and strength.
58101. 
58102. Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused
58103. the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar's wish, to
58104. select him--an old man in disfavor--to be their representative in the
58105. national war. And only that feeling placed him on that highest human
58106. pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all his powers
58107. not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on
58108. them.
58109. 
58110. That simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not be cast
58111. in the false mold of a European hero--the supposed ruler of men--that
58112. history has invented.
58113. 
58114. To a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception of
58115. greatness.
58116. 
58117. 
58118. 
58119. 
58120. 
58121. CHAPTER VI
58122. 
58123. 
58124. The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of
58125. Krasnoe. Toward evening--after much disputing and many mistakes made by
58126. generals who did not go to their proper places, and after adjutants had
58127. been sent about with counterorders--when it had become plain that the
58128. enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no
58129. battle, Kutuzov left Krasnoe and went to Dobroe whither his headquarters
58130. had that day been transferred.
58131. 
58132. The day was clear and frosty. Kutuzov rode to Dobroe on his plump little
58133. white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who
58134. whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the road groups of
58135. French prisoners captured that day (there were seven thousand of them)
58136. were crowding to warm themselves at campfires. Near Dobroe an immense
58137. crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged
58138. in anything they had been able to get hold of, were standing in the road
58139. beside a long row of unharnessed French guns. At the approach of the
58140. commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on
58141. Kutuzov who, wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat
58142. that bulged on his round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his
58143. white horse. One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and
58144. prisoners had been captured.
58145. 
58146. Kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was
58147. saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed
58148. attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a specially
58149. wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses
58150. and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and festering eyes.
58151. 
58152. One group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them, one of
58153. whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of raw
58154. flesh with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial in
58155. the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent
58156. expression with which, after a glance at Kutuzov, the soldier with the
58157. sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing.
58158. 
58159. Kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He puckered his
58160. face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At another
58161. spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the
58162. shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly manner, and Kutuzov with
58163. the same expression on his face again swayed his head.
58164. 
58165. "What were you saying?" he asked the general, who continuing his report
58166. directed the commander in chief's attention to some standards captured
58167. from the French and standing in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment.
58168. 
58169. "Ah, the standards!" said Kutuzov, evidently detaching himself with
58170. difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.
58171. 
58172. He looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at him from
58173. all sides awaiting a word from him.
58174. 
58175. He stopped in front of the Preobrazhensk regiment, sighed deeply, and
58176. closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying
58177. the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them.
58178. Kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then, submitting with evident
58179. reluctance to the duty imposed by his position, raised his head
58180. and began to speak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He looked
58181. attentively around at the circle of officers, recognizing several of
58182. them.
58183. 
58184. "I thank you all!" he said, addressing the soldiers and then again the
58185. officers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were
58186. distinctly heard. "I thank you all for your hard and faithful service.
58187. The victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor to you
58188. forever."
58189. 
58190. He paused and looked around.
58191. 
58192. "Lower its head, lower it!" he said to a soldier who had accidentally
58193. lowered the French eagle he was holding before the Preobrazhensk
58194. standards. "Lower, lower, that's it. Hurrah lads!" he added, addressing
58195. the men with a rapid movement of his chin.
58196. 
58197. "Hur-r-rah!" roared thousands of voices.
58198. 
58199. While the soldiers were shouting Kutuzov leaned forward in his saddle
58200. and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic
58201. gleam.
58202. 
58203. "You see, brothers..." said he when the shouts had ceased... and all at
58204. once his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no longer
58205. the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to
58206. tell his comrades something very important.
58207. 
58208. There was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the
58209. soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was going to
58210. say.
58211. 
58212. "You see, brothers, I know it's hard for you, but it can't be helped!
58213. Bear up; it won't be for long now! We'll see our visitors off and then
58214. we'll rest. The Tsar won't forget your service. It is hard for you, but
58215. still you are at home while they--you see what they have come to," said
58216. he, pointing to the prisoners. "Worse off than our poorest beggars.
58217. While they were strong we didn't spare ourselves, but now we may even
58218. pity them. They are human beings too. Isn't it so, lads?"
58219. 
58220. He looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze fixed
58221. upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew brighter
58222. and brighter with an old man's mild smile, which drew the corners of his
58223. lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased speaking and bowed
58224. his head as if in perplexity.
58225. 
58226. "But after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody
58227. bastards!" he cried, suddenly lifting his head.
58228. 
58229. And flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time
58230. during the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the soldiers
58231. laughing joyfully and shouting "Hurrah!"
58232. 
58233. Kutuzov's words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could have
58234. repeated the field marshal's address, begun solemnly and then changing
58235. into an old man's simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that
58236. speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe
58237. and consciousness of the justice of our cause, exactly expressed by that
58238. old man's good-natured expletives, was not merely understood but lay
58239. in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and
58240. long-sustained shouts. Afterwards when one of the generals addressed
58241. Kutuzov asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for, Kutuzov in
58242. answering unexpectedly gave a sob, being evidently greatly moved.
58243. 
58244. 
58245. 
58246. 
58247. 
58248. CHAPTER VII
58249. 
58250. 
58251. When the troops reached their night's halting place on the eighth of
58252. November, the last day of the Krasnoe battles, it was already growing
58253. dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly
58254. falling snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the falling
58255. snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew
58256. keener.
58257. 
58258. An infantry regiment which had left Tarutino three thousand strong but
58259. now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night
58260. at its halting place--a village on the highroad. The quartermasters who
58261. met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead
58262. Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff. There was only one hut
58263. available for the regimental commander.
58264. 
58265. The commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the
58266. village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.
58267. 
58268. Like some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its
58269. lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep
58270. through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, and
58271. immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of branches,
58272. and merry voices could be heard from there. Another section amid the
58273. regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy
58274. getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third
58275. section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff
58276. officers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and
58277. dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the
58278. campfires, or wattle fences to serve for shelter.
58279. 
58280. Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle
58281. wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.
58282. 
58283. "Now then, all together--shove!" cried the voices, and the huge surface
58284. of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen
58285. swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked more and
58286. more and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had been pushing
58287. it. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.
58288. 
58289. "Now then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That's it... Where are
58290. you shoving to?"
58291. 
58292. "Now, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!"
58293. 
58294. All stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to sing. At
58295. the end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty voices
58296. roared out at once: "Oo-oo-oo-oo! That's it. All together! Heave away,
58297. boys!..." but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved, and
58298. in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible.
58299. 
58300. "Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand...
58301. will you? You may want us one of these days."
58302. 
58303. Some twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into the
58304. village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about
58305. thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the
58306. village street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the
58307. gasping men.
58308. 
58309. "Get along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now..."
58310. 
58311. Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.
58312. 
58313. "What are you up to?" suddenly came the authoritative voice of a
58314. sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.
58315. "There are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you
58316. foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, I'll give it to you!" shouted he,
58317. hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back.
58318. "Can't you make less noise?"
58319. 
58320. The men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped
58321. his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against
58322. the wattle.
58323. 
58324. "There, how that devil hits out! He's made my face all bloody," said he
58325. in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.
58326. 
58327. "Don't you like it?" said a laughing voice, and moderating their tones
58328. the men moved forward.
58329. 
58330. When they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as
58331. before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.
58332. 
58333. In the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered and
58334. were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the
58335. maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a flank march
58336. to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture him.
58337. 
58338. By the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place
58339. the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood
58340. crackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers flitted
58341. to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden
58342. down.
58343. 
58344. Axes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without any
58345. orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night, shelters
58346. were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being boiled, and muskets
58347. and accouterments put in order.
58348. 
58349. The wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the
58350. Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket rests,
58351. and a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo, called the
58352. roll, had supper, and settled down round the fires for the night--some
58353. repairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some stripping
58354. themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts.
58355. 
58356. 
58357. 
58358. 
58359. 
58360. CHAPTER VIII
58361. 
58362. 
58363. One would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched
58364. conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that time--lacking warm boots
58365. and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the snow
58366. with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations (the
58367. commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)--they would have
58368. presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.
58369. 
58370. On the contrary, the army had never under the best material conditions
58371. presented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This was because all who
58372. began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army
58373. day by day. All the physically or morally weak had long since been
58374. left behind and only the flower of the army--physically and
58375. mentally--remained.
58376. 
58377. More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than
58378. anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their
58379. campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by their wattle
58380. they demanded contributions of fuel.
58381. 
58382. "Eh, Makeev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you lost or
58383. have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!" shouted a red-haired
58384. and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the
58385. smoke but not moving back from the fire. "And you, Jackdaw, go and fetch
58386. some wood!" said he to another soldier.
58387. 
58388. This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being
58389. robust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier
58390. they called "Jackdaw," a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose
58391. obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into
58392. the light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier
58393. carrying a load of wood.
58394. 
58395. "Bring it here--that's fine!"
58396. 
58397. They split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with
58398. their mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, making
58399. the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit their pipes.
58400. The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood, setting his arms
58401. akimbo, began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot
58402. where he stood.
58403. 
58404. "Mother! The dew is cold but clear.... It's well that I'm a
58405. musketeer..." he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.
58406. 
58407. "Look out, your soles will fly off!" shouted the red-haired man,
58408. noticing that the sole of the dancer's boot was hanging loose. "What a
58409. fellow you are for dancing!"
58410. 
58411. The dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw it
58412. on the fire.
58413. 
58414. "Right enough, friend," said he, and, having sat down, took out of his
58415. knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his foot.
58416. "It's the steam that spoils them," he added, stretching out his feet
58417. toward the fire.
58418. 
58419. "They'll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when we've finished
58420. hammering them, we're to receive double kits!"
58421. 
58422. "And that son of a bitch Petrov has lagged behind after all, it seems,"
58423. said one sergeant major.
58424. 
58425. "I've had an eye on him this long while," said the other.
58426. 
58427. "Well, he's a poor sort of soldier..."
58428. 
58429. "But in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday."
58430. 
58431. "Yes, it's all very well, but when a man's feet are frozen how can he
58432. walk?"
58433. 
58434. "Eh? Don't talk nonsense!" said a sergeant major.
58435. 
58436. "Do you want to be doing the same?" said an old soldier, turning
58437. reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.
58438. 
58439. "Well, you know," said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a
58440. squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the
58441. fire, "a plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it's death. Take
58442. me, now! I've got no strength left," he added, with sudden resolution
58443. turning to the sergeant major. "Tell them to send me to hospital; I'm
58444. aching all over; anyway I shan't be able to keep up."
58445. 
58446. "That'll do, that'll do!" replied the sergeant major quietly.
58447. 
58448. The soldier said no more and the talk went on.
58449. 
58450. "What a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is that
58451. not one of them had what you might call real boots on," said a soldier,
58452. starting a new theme. "They were no more than make-believes."
58453. 
58454. "The Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for the
58455. colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys," put in
58456. the dancer. "As they turned them over one seemed still alive and, would
58457. you believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo."
58458. 
58459. "But they're a clean folk, lads," the first man went on; "he was
58460. white--as white as birchbark--and some of them are such fine fellows,
58461. you might think they were nobles."
58462. 
58463. "Well, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there."
58464. 
58465. "But they don't understand our talk at all," said the dancer with a
58466. puzzled smile. "I asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in his
58467. own way. A queer lot!"
58468. 
58469. "But it's strange, friends," continued the man who had wondered at their
58470. whiteness, "the peasants at Mozhaysk were saying that when they began
58471. burying the dead--where the battle was you know--well, those dead had
58472. been lying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, 'they lie
58473. as white as paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder
58474. smoke.'"
58475. 
58476. "Was it from the cold?" asked someone.
58477. 
58478. "You're a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If it
58479. had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. 'But,' he
58480. says, 'go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,' he says,
58481. 'we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag
58482. them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,' he says, 'are white as paper
58483. and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.'"
58484. 
58485. All were silent.
58486. 
58487. "It must be from their food," said the sergeant major. "They used to
58488. gobble the same food as the gentry."
58489. 
58490. No one contradicted him.
58491. 
58492. "That peasant near Mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were all
58493. called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and
58494. still didn't finish carting the dead away. And as for the wolves, he
58495. says..."
58496. 
58497. "That was a real battle," said an old soldier. "It's the only one worth
58498. remembering; but since that... it's only been tormenting folk."
58499. 
58500. "And do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and,
58501. my word, they didn't let us get near before they just threw down their
58502. muskets and went on their knees. 'Pardon!' they say. That's only one
58503. case. They say Platov took 'Poleon himself twice. But he didn't know the
58504. right charm. He catches him and catches him--no good! He turns into
58505. a bird in his hands and flies away. And there's no way of killing him
58506. either."
58507. 
58508. "You're a first-class liar, Kiselev, when I come to look at you!"
58509. 
58510. "Liar, indeed! It's the real truth."
58511. 
58512. "If he fell into my hands, when I'd caught him I'd bury him in the
58513. ground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men he's
58514. ruined!"
58515. 
58516. "Well, anyhow we're going to end it. He won't come here again," remarked
58517. the old soldier, yawning.
58518. 
58519. The conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to sleep.
58520. 
58521. "Look at the stars. It's wonderful how they shine! You would think the
58522. women had spread out their linen," said one of the men, gazing with
58523. admiration at the Milky Way.
58524. 
58525. "That's a sign of a good harvest next year."
58526. 
58527. "We shall want some more wood."
58528. 
58529. "You warm your back and your belly gets frozen. That's queer."
58530. 
58531. "O Lord!"
58532. 
58533. "What are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how he's
58534. sprawling!"
58535. 
58536. In the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen asleep
58537. could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now and again
58538. exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound
58539. of general, merry laughter.
58540. 
58541. "Hark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!" said one of the
58542. soldiers, "and what a lot of them there are!"
58543. 
58544. One of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.
58545. 
58546. "They're having such fun," said he, coming back. "Two Frenchies have
58547. turned up. One's quite frozen and the other's an awful swaggerer. He's
58548. singing songs...."
58549. 
58550. "Oh, I'll go across and have a look...."
58551. 
58552. And several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.
58553. 
58554. 
58555. 
58556. 
58557. 
58558. CHAPTER IX
58559. 
58560. 
58561. The fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest. A huge
58562. campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, lighting up the
58563. branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.
58564. 
58565. About midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest,
58566. and the crackling of dry branches.
58567. 
58568. "A bear, lads," said one of the men.
58569. 
58570. They all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest into the
58571. bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to
58572. one another.
58573. 
58574. These were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. They came up
58575. to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did
58576. not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an officer's hat
58577. and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he had been going to
58578. sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl
58579. tied round his head, was stronger. He raised his companion and said
58580. something, pointing to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen,
58581. spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man, and brought some
58582. buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them.
58583. 
58584. The exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head
58585. wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.
58586. 
58587. When Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he
58588. suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the
58589. soldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and
58590. resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, looking at
58591. the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted
58592. a long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel, pointing to his
58593. shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was
58594. an officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer who had come up
58595. to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a French
58596. officer into his hut to warm him, and when the messenger returned and
58597. said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him, Ramballe
58598. was told to go. He rose and tried to walk, but staggered and would have
58599. fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up.
58600. 
58601. "You won't do it again, eh?" said one of the soldiers, winking and
58602. turning mockingly to Ramballe.
58603. 
58604. "Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are--a real peasant!"
58605. came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.
58606. 
58607. They surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two
58608. soldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around their
58609. necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:
58610. 
58611. "Oh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh, my
58612. brave, kind friends," and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one
58613. of the men like a child.
58614. 
58615. Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, surrounded by
58616. the soldiers.
58617. 
58618. Morel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes, was
58619. wearing a woman's cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his
58620. head over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a French song
58621. in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier.
58622. The soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him.
58623. 
58624. "Now then, now then, teach us how it goes! I'll soon pick it up. How is
58625. it?" said the man--a singer and a wag--whom Morel was embracing.
58626. 
58627. "Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!" sang Morel, winking. "Ce
58628. diable a quatre..." *
58629. 
58630. 
58631.      * "Long live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy
58632.      devil."
58633. 
58634. 
58635. "Vivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!" repeated the soldier, flourishing
58636. his arm and really catching the tune.
58637. 
58638. "Bravo! Ha, ha, ha!" rose their rough, joyous laughter from all sides.
58639. 
58640. Morel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.
58641. 
58642. "Well, go on, go on!"
58643. 
58644.     "Qui eut le triple talent,
58645.     De boire, de battre,
58646.     Et d'etre un vert galant." *
58647. 
58648. 
58649.       * Who had a triple talent
58650.       For drinking, for fighting,
58651.       And for being a gallant old boy...
58652. 
58653. 
58654. "It goes smoothly, too. Well, now, Zaletaev!"
58655. 
58656. "Ke..." Zaletaev, brought out with effort: "ke-e-e-e," he drawled,
58657. laboriously pursing his lips, "le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e
58658. de-tra-va-ga-la" he sang.
58659. 
58660. "Fine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to eat?"
58661. 
58662. "Give him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after
58663. starving."
58664. 
58665. They gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on
58666. his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him.
58667. The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such
58668. nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one
58669. would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a
58670. smile.
58671. 
58672. "They are men too," said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his
58673. coat. "Even wormwood grows on its own root."
58674. 
58675. "O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard
58676. frost...."
58677. 
58678. They all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking
58679. at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring
58680. up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering something
58681. gladsome and mysterious to one another.
58682. 
58683. 
58684. 
58685. 
58686. 
58687. CHAPTER X
58688. 
58689. 
58690. The French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical
58691. progression; and that crossing of the Berezina about which so much has
58692. been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, and
58693. not at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much has been
58694. and still is written about the Berezina, on the French side this is only
58695. because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army
58696. had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment
58697. into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory, and on the
58698. Russian side merely because in Petersburg--far from the seat of war--a
58699. plan (again one of Pfuel's) had been devised to catch Napoleon in a
58700. strategic trap at the Berezina River. Everyone assured himself that all
58701. would happen according to plan, and therefore insisted that it was just
58702. the crossing of the Berezina that destroyed the French army. In reality
58703. the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the French--in
58704. guns and men lost--than Krasnoe had been, as the figures show.
58705. 
58706. The sole importance of the crossing of the Berezina lies in the fact
58707. that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for
58708. cutting off the enemy's retreat and the soundness of the only possible
58709. line of action--the one Kutuzov and the general mass of the army
58710. demanded--namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd fled
58711. at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to
58712. reaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible
58713. to block its path. This was shown not so much by the arrangements it
58714. made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges. When the bridges
58715. broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with
58716. children who were with the French transport, all--carried on by vis
58717. inertiae--pressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and
58718. did not, surrender.
58719. 
58720. That impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of pursuers
58721. was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own people each
58722. might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held
58723. among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same
58724. pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in the
58725. necessities of life. The French did not need to be informed of the fact
58726. that half the prisoners--with whom the Russians did not know what to
58727. do--perished of cold and hunger despite their captors' desire to save
58728. them; they felt that it could not be otherwise. The most compassionate
58729. Russian commanders, those favorable to the French--and even the
58730. Frenchmen in the Russian service--could do nothing for the prisoners.
58731. The French perished from the conditions to which the Russian army was
58732. itself exposed. It was impossible to take bread and clothes from our
58733. hungry and indispensable soldiers to give to the French who, though not
58734. harmful, or hated, or guilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians
58735. even did that, but they were exceptions.
58736. 
58737. Certain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was hope.
58738. Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective
58739. flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.
58740. 
58741. The farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the
58742. remnant, especially after the Berezina, on which (in consequence of the
58743. Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, and
58744. the keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed one
58745. another and Kutuzov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of
58746. the Petersburg Berezina plan would be attributed to Kutuzov led
58747. to dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly
58748. expressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a
58749. respectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was
58750. to blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or
58751. asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable
58752. formality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at
58753. every turn.
58754. 
58755. Because they could not understand him all these people assumed that
58756. it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the
58757. profundity of their plans, that he would answer with his phrases (which
58758. they thought were mere phrases) about a "golden bridge," about the
58759. impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions,
58760. and so forth. They had heard all that before. And all he said--that it
58761. was necessary to await provisions, or that the men had no boots--was so
58762. simple, while what they proposed was so complicated and clever, that
58763. it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they, though not in
58764. power, were commanders of genius.
58765. 
58766. After the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg
58767. hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their
58768. maximum. Kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.
58769. Only once, after the affair of the Berezina, did he get angry and write
58770. to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following
58771. letter:
58772. 
58773. "On account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency please
58774. be so good as to set off for Kaluga on receipt of this, and there await
58775. further commands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty."
58776. 
58777. But after Bennigsen's departure, the Grand Duke Tsarevich Constantine
58778. Pavlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the beginning of the
58779. campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by Kutuzov.
58780. Now having come to the army, he informed Kutuzov of the Emperor's
58781. displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their
58782. advance. The Emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days'
58783. time.
58784. 
58785. The old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs--this
58786. same Kutuzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief
58787. against the sovereign's wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and
58788. heir--apparent from the army--who on his own authority and contrary
58789. to the Emperor's will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now
58790. realized at once that his day was over, that his part was played,
58791. and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he
58792. understood this not merely from the attitude of the court. He saw on the
58793. one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was
58794. ended and felt that his mission was accomplished; and at the same time
58795. he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and
58796. of the necessity of physical rest.
58797. 
58798. On the twenty-ninth of November Kutuzov entered Vilna--his "dear Vilna"
58799. as he called it. Twice during his career Kutuzov had been governor of
58800. Vilna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old
58801. friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had
58802. so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army
58803. and state and, as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed,
58804. immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been
58805. accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be
58806. done in the realm of history did not concern him at all.
58807. 
58808. Chichagov, one of the most zealous "cutters-off" and "breakers-up," who
58809. had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but
58810. never wished to go where he was sent: Chichagov, noted for the boldness
58811. with which he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered Kutuzov to be
58812. under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace
58813. with Turkey in 1811 independently of Kutuzov, and found that peace had
58814. already been concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of
58815. securing that peace was really Kutuzov's; this Chichagov was the first
58816. to meet Kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress
58817. naval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he handed
58818. Kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town. The contemptuously
58819. respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was
58820. expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of Chichagov, who knew
58821. of the accusations that were being directed against Kutuzov.
58822. 
58823. When speaking to Chichagov, Kutuzov incidentally mentioned that the
58824. vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at Borisov
58825. had been recovered and would be restored to him.
58826. 
58827. "You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the
58828. contrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give
58829. dinner parties," warmly replied Chichagov, who tried by every word he
58830. spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutuzov to be
58831. animated by the same desire.
58832. 
58833. Kutuzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating
58834. smile: "I meant merely to say what I said."
58835. 
58836. Contrary to the Emperor's wish Kutuzov detained the greater part of the
58837. army at Vilna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack
58838. and physically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army
58839. affairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting
58840. the Emperor's arrival led a dissipated life.
58841. 
58842. Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite--Count
58843. Tolstoy, Prince Volkonski, Arakcheev, and others--the Emperor reached
58844. Vilna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to
58845. the castle. In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff
58846. officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle, as well as
58847. a guard of honor of the Semenov regiment.
58848. 
58849. A courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with three
58850. foam-flecked horses, shouted "Coming!" and Konovnitsyn rushed into the
58851. vestibule to inform Kutuzov, who was waiting in the hall porter's little
58852. lodge.
58853. 
58854. A minute later the old man's large stout figure in full-dress uniform,
58855. his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach,
58856. waddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with its peaks to the
58857. sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort
58858. sideways down the steps to the level of the street, took in his hand the
58859. report he had prepared for the Emperor.
58860. 
58861. There was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew
58862. furiously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh
58863. in which the figures of the Emperor and Volkonski could already be
58864. descried.
58865. 
58866. From the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect
58867. on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all over,
58868. readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and,
58869. at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh,
58870. lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his
58871. smooth, ingratiating voice.
58872. 
58873. The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutuzov from head to foot,
58874. frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the
58875. old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too, owing
58876. to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings, had its
58877. usual effect on Kutuzov and he gave a sob.
58878. 
58879. The Emperor greeted the officers and the Semenov guard, and again
58880. pressing the old man's hand went with him into the castle.
58881. 
58882. When alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his
58883. dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made
58884. at Krasnoe and the Berezina, and informed him of his intentions for a
58885. future campaign abroad. Kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark. The same
58886. submissive, expressionless look with which he had listened to the
58887. Emperor's commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before settled
58888. on his face now.
58889. 
58890. When Kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing
58891. the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someone's
58892. voice saying:
58893. 
58894. "Your Serene Highness!"
58895. 
58896. Kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of
58897. Count Tolstoy, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay
58898. a small object. Kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of
58899. him.
58900. 
58901. Suddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed
58902. across his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the
58903. object that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the
58904. First Class.
58905. 
58906. 
58907. 
58908. 
58909. 
58910. CHAPTER XI
58911. 
58912. 
58913. Next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor
58914. honored by his presence. Kutuzov had received the Order of St. George
58915. of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors, but
58916. everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties
58917. were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example,
58918. but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and
58919. good-for-nothing. When Kutuzov, conforming to a custom of Catherine's
58920. day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the
58921. Emperor's feet on his entering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face
58922. and muttered something in which some people caught the words, "the old
58923. comedian."
58924. 
58925. The Emperor's displeasure with Kutuzov was specially increased at Vilna
58926. by the fact that Kutuzov evidently could not or would not understand the
58927. importance of the coming campaign.
58928. 
58929. When on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers assembled
58930. about him: "You have not only saved Russia, you have saved Europe!" they
58931. all understood that the war was not ended.
58932. 
58933. Kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that
58934. no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia,
58935. but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had
58936. gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying
58937. fresh troops, spoke of the hardships already endured by the people, of
58938. the possibility of failure and so forth.
58939. 
58940. This being the field marshal's frame of mind he was naturally regarded
58941. as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.
58942. 
58943. To avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural method was
58944. to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at
58945. the beginning of the Russian campaign--to transfer the authority to the
58946. Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the commander in
58947. chief's feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the
58948. change.
58949. 
58950. With this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real
58951. strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, Konovnitsyn, and
58952. Ermolov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field
58953. marshal's great weakness and failing health.
58954. 
58955. His health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to
58956. another. And in fact his health was poor.
58957. 
58958. So naturally, simply, and gradually--just as he had come from Turkey to
58959. the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to the army
58960. when he was needed there--now when his part was played out, Kutuzov's
58961. place was taken by a new and necessary performer.
58962. 
58963. The war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to every Russian
58964. heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.
58965. 
58966. The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a
58967. movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another
58968. leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from
58969. Kutuzov's and animated by different motives.
58970. 
58971. Alexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east
58972. to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as Kutuzov had been
58973. for the salvation and glory of Russia.
58974. 
58975. Kutuzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or
58976. Napoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative of
58977. the Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had
58978. been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing
58979. left to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the representative of the
58980. national war but to die, and Kutuzov died.
58981. 
58982. 
58983. 
58984. 
58985. 
58986. CHAPTER XII
58987. 
58988. 
58989. As generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the
58990. physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after
58991. they were over. After his liberation he reached Orel, and on the third
58992. day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up
58993. for three months. He had what the doctors termed "bilious fever." But
58994. despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him
58995. medicines to drink, he recovered.
58996. 
58997. Scarcely any impression was left on Pierre's mind by all that happened
58998. to him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He remembered
58999. only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical
59000. distress, and pains in his feet and side. He remembered a general
59001. impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being
59002. worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him, he
59003. also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses, and
59004. above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time.
59005. On the day of his rescue he had seen the body of Petya Rostov. That same
59006. day he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of
59007. Borodino for more than a month had recently died in the Rostovs' house
59008. at Yaroslavl, and Denisov who told him this news also mentioned Helene's
59009. death, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at
59010. the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its
59011. significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as
59012. possible from places where people were killing one another, to some
59013. peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over
59014. all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Orel he
59015. immediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw
59016. in attendance on him two of his servants, Terenty and Vaska, who had
59017. come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been
59018. living on his estate at Elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had
59019. come to look after him.
59020. 
59021. It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the
59022. impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months
59023. and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere
59024. tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he
59025. would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in
59026. his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity. In the
59027. same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been
59028. told after his rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of
59029. his wife, and the destruction of the French.
59030. 
59031. A joyous feeling of freedom--that complete inalienable freedom natural
59032. to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside
59033. Moscow--filled Pierre's soul during his convalescence. He was surprised
59034. to find that this inner freedom, which was independent of external
59035. conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of external
59036. liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without acquaintances. No one
59037. demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere. He had all he wanted:
59038. the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no
59039. longer there, since she was no more.
59040. 
59041. "Oh, how good! How splendid!" said he to himself when a cleanly laid
59042. table was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down for
59043. the night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the French had
59044. gone and that his wife was no more. "Oh, how good, how splendid!"
59045. 
59046. And by old habit he asked himself the question: "Well, and what then?
59047. What am I going to do?" And he immediately gave himself the answer:
59048. "Well, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!"
59049. 
59050. The very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he had
59051. continually sought to find--the aim of life--no longer existed for
59052. him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared
59053. temporarily--he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not
59054. present itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the
59055. complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at
59056. this time.
59057. 
59058. He could not see an aim, for he now had faith--not faith in any kind
59059. of rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever-manifest
59060. God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. That search for
59061. an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity
59062. he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his
59063. nurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere. In his
59064. captivity he had learned that in Karataev God was greater, more infinite
59065. and unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the
59066. Freemasons. He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into
59067. the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet. All his life
59068. he had looked over the heads of the men around him, when he should have
59069. merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes.
59070. 
59071. In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable
59072. infinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and
59073. had looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had only
59074. what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had equipped
59075. himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space, where
59076. petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him
59077. great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen. And such
59078. had European life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and philanthropy
59079. seemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as he had accounted
59080. them, his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen
59081. the same pettiness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, however, he
59082. had learned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and
59083. therefore--to see it and enjoy its contemplation--he naturally threw
59084. away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over men's heads,
59085. and gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable,
59086. and infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil
59087. and happy he became. That dreadful question, "What for?" which had
59088. formerly destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed for him.
59089. To that question, "What for?" a simple answer was now always ready in
59090. his soul: "Because there is a God, that God without whose will not one
59091. hair falls from a man's head."
59092. 
59093. 
59094. 
59095. 
59096. 
59097. CHAPTER XIII
59098. 
59099. 
59100. In external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance he
59101. was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed
59102. occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special
59103. of his own. The difference between his former and present self was that
59104. formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to
59105. him, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to
59106. distinguish something at a distance. At present he still forgot what was
59107. said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes, but he now
59108. looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what
59109. was before him and listened to what was said, though evidently seeing
59110. and hearing something quite different. Formerly he had appeared to be
59111. a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so people had been inclined to avoid
59112. him. Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and
59113. sympathy for others, shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to
59114. whether they were as contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his
59115. presence.
59116. 
59117. Previously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and
59118. seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and
59119. knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate
59120. secrets.
59121. 
59122. The princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly
59123. hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after
59124. the old count's death, now after staying a short time in Orel--where she
59125. had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she
59126. considered it her duty to nurse him--felt to her surprise and vexation
59127. that she had become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her
59128. approval, he merely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt
59129. that he regarded her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into
59130. herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side
59131. of her nature; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most
59132. intimate places of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards
59133. gratefully, she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.
59134. 
59135. The most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more
59136. successfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and
59137. showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre's cunning consisted simply in
59138. finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered,
59139. hard, and (in her own way) proud princess.
59140. 
59141. "Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence of
59142. bad people but of people such as myself," thought she.
59143. 
59144. His servants too--Terenty and Vaska--in their own way noticed the change
59145. that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had become much
59146. "simpler." Terenty, when he had helped him undress and wished him good
59147. night, often lingered with his master's boots in his hands and clothes
59148. over his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. And Pierre,
59149. noticing that Terenty wanted a chat, generally kept him there.
59150. 
59151. "Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?" he would ask.
59152. 
59153. And Terenty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of
59154. the old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and
59155. talking, or sometimes listening to Pierre's stories, and then would go
59156. out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and
59157. affection for him.
59158. 
59159. The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though he
59160. considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment
59161. was of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Pierre
59162. telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the
59163. characters of his patients in general, and especially of the ladies.
59164. 
59165. "It's a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our
59166. provincials," he would say.
59167. 
59168. There were several prisoners from the French army in Orel, and the
59169. doctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.
59170. 
59171. This officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make fun of
59172. the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.
59173. 
59174. The Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk
59175. with him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love,
59176. and pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially
59177. against Napoleon.
59178. 
59179. "If all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight
59180. such a nation," he said to Pierre. "You, who have suffered so from the
59181. French, do not even feel animosity toward them."
59182. 
59183. Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by
59184. evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing.
59185. 
59186. During the last days of Pierre's stay in Orel his old Masonic
59187. acquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in
59188. 1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who
59189. had a large estate in Orel province, and he occupied a temporary post in
59190. the commissariat department in that town.
59191. 
59192. Hearing that Bezukhov was in Orel, Willarski, though they had never been
59193. intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy
59194. that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another.
59195. Willarski felt dull in Orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own
59196. circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.
59197. 
59198. But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much
59199. behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into
59200. apathy and egotism.
59201. 
59202. "You are letting yourself go, my dear fellow," he said.
59203. 
59204. But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been
59205. formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as
59206. he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that
59207. he had been like that himself but a short time before.
59208. 
59209. Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs,
59210. his wife's affairs, and his official duties. He regarded all these
59211. occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all
59212. contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his
59213. family. Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests
59214. continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre, without trying to
59215. change the other's views and without condemning him, but with the quiet,
59216. joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, was interested in this
59217. strange though very familiar phenomenon.
59218. 
59219. There was a new feature in Pierre's relations with Willarski, with the
59220. princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which
59221. gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of
59222. the impossibility of changing a man's convictions by words, and his
59223. recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing
59224. things each from his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of
59225. each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a
59226. basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other
59227. people. The difference, and sometimes complete contradiction, between
59228. men's opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased
59229. him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile.
59230. 
59231. In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center
59232. of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary questions,
59233. especially requests for money to which, as an extremely wealthy man,
59234. he was very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and
59235. perplexity. "To give or not to give?" he had asked himself. "I have
59236. it and he needs it. But someone else needs it still more. Who needs it
59237. most? And perhaps they are both impostors?" In the old days he had been
59238. unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all
59239. who asked as long as he had anything to give. Formerly he had been in a
59240. similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his
59241. property, when one person advised one thing and another something else.
59242. 
59243. Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or
59244. perplexity about these questions. There was now within him a judge who
59245. by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done.
59246. 
59247. He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he felt
59248. certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first time he
59249. had recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a colonel,
59250. came to him and, after talking a great deal about his exploits,
59251. concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre should give
59252. him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children. Pierre
59253. refused without the least difficulty or effort, and was afterwards
59254. surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so
59255. insurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused the colonel's
59256. demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when
59257. leaving Orel, to induce the Italian officer to accept some money of
59258. which he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own
59259. more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision
59260. with regard to his wife's debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in
59261. and near Moscow.
59262. 
59263. His head steward came to him at Orel and Pierre reckoned up with him his
59264. diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according to the
59265. head steward's calculation, about two million rubles.
59266. 
59267. To console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate
59268. showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but
59269. would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife's debts which he
59270. was under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Moscow house
59271. and the country house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty
59272. thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.
59273. 
59274. "Yes, of course that's true," said Pierre with a cheerful smile. "I
59275. don't need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much richer."
59276. 
59277. But in January Savelich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the
59278. state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made
59279. of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this
59280. as of a settled matter. About the same time he received letters from
59281. Prince Vasili and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife's
59282. debts. And Pierre decided that the steward's proposals which had so
59283. pleased him were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his
59284. wife's affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he
59285. did not know, but he knew for certain that it was necessary. His income
59286. would be reduced by three fourths, but he felt it must be done.
59287. 
59288. Willarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.
59289. 
59290. During the whole time of his convalescence in Orel Pierre had
59291. experienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his
59292. journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new
59293. faces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt like
59294. a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone--the stagecoach driver, the post-house
59295. overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the villages--had a
59296. new significance for him. The presence and remarks of Willarski who
59297. continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia and its
59298. backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre's pleasure.
59299. Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary strength
59300. and vitality--the strength which in that vast space amid the snows
59301. maintained the life of this original, peculiar, and unique people.
59302. He did not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with him--an
59303. apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that
59304. could lead to nothing--and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him.
59305. 
59306. 
59307. 
59308. 
59309. 
59310. CHAPTER XIV
59311. 
59312. 
59313. It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap
59314. has been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of
59315. rubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they
59316. jostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally
59317. difficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the
59318. French to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But when
59319. we watch the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and
59320. immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction
59321. of the heap, something indestructible, which though intangible is the
59322. real strength of the colony, still exists; and similarly, though in
59323. Moscow in the month of October there was no government and no churches,
59324. shrines, riches, or houses--it was still the Moscow it had been in
59325. August. All was destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and
59326. indestructible.
59327. 
59328. The motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after it had
59329. been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at first
59330. for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had in
59331. common: a desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to
59332. apply their activities there.
59333. 
59334. Within a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a
59335. fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the
59336. number, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in
59337. 1812.
59338. 
59339. The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerode's
59340. detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and residents who had
59341. fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity. The Russians who
59342. entered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered it in their turn. They
59343. continued what the French had begun. Trains of peasant carts came to
59344. Moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the
59345. ruined houses and the streets. The Cossacks carried off what they could
59346. to their camps, and the householders seized all they could find in other
59347. houses and moved it to their own, pretending that it was their property.
59348. 
59349. But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third
59350. contingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more
59351. difficult and assumed more definite forms.
59352. 
59353. The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of
59354. regular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, with
59355. luxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms were
59356. lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses,
59357. market stalls, granaries--for the most part still stocked with
59358. goods--and there were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy
59359. houses filled with luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices,
59360. churches, and cathedrals. The longer the French remained the more these
59361. forms of town life perished, until finally all was merged into one
59362. confused, lifeless scene of plunder.
59363. 
59364. The more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the
59365. wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But
59366. plundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city
59367. began, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater
59368. the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth
59369. of the city and its regular life restored.
59370. 
59371. Besides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by curiosity,
59372. some by official duties, some by self-interest--house owners, clergy,
59373. officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and peasants--streamed into
59374. Moscow as blood flows to the heart.
59375. 
59376. Within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off
59377. plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses
59378. out of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrades'
59379. discomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down
59380. one another's prices to below what they had been in former days. Gangs
59381. of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, and on
59382. all sides logs were being hewn, new houses built, and old, charred ones
59383. repaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns were
59384. opened in partially burned houses. The clergy resumed the services
59385. in many churches that had not been burned. Donors contributed
59386. Church property that had been stolen. Government clerks set up their
59387. baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms.
59388. The higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of
59389. goods left behind by the French. The owners of houses in which much
59390. property had been left, brought there from other houses, complained of
59391. the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Kremlin;
59392. others insisted that as the French had gathered things from different
59393. houses into this or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to
59394. keep all that was found there. They abused the police and bribed them,
59395. made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that
59396. had perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count Rostopchin
59397. wrote proclamations.
59398. 
59399. 
59400. 
59401. 
59402. 
59403. CHAPTER XV
59404. 
59405. 
59406. At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of
59407. his house which had not been burned. He called on Count Rostopchin and
59408. on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he intended to leave
59409. for Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celebrating the victory,
59410. everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city.
59411. Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished to meet him, and
59412. everyone questioned him about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly
59413. well disposed toward them all, but was now instinctively on his
59414. guard for fear of binding himself in any way. To all questions put to
59415. him--whether important or quite trifling--such as: Where would he live?
59416. Was he going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg and would he
59417. mind taking a parcel for someone?--he replied: "Yes, perhaps," or, "I
59418. think so," and so on.
59419. 
59420. He had heard that the Rostovs were at Kostroma but the thought of
59421. Natasha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant
59422. memory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from social
59423. obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had
59424. aroused in himself.
59425. 
59426. On the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetskoys that
59427. Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of
59428. Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre's thoughts and now recurred to
59429. him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary
59430. was in Moscow and living in her house--which had not been burned--in
59431. Vozdvizhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.
59432. 
59433. On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their
59434. friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last
59435. one at Borodino.
59436. 
59437. "Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?
59438. Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him
59439. before he died?" thought Pierre. He recalled Karataev and his death and
59440. involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so
59441. similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he
59442. felt for both of them.
59443. 
59444. Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood.
59445. The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its
59446. general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a
59447. stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence
59448. of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house,
59449. informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments, and that
59450. she received on Sundays.
59451. 
59452. "Announce me. Perhaps she will see me," said Pierre.
59453. 
59454. "Yes, sir," said the man. "Please step into the portrait gallery."
59455. 
59456. A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought
59457. word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he
59458. would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.
59459. 
59460. In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her
59461. another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess
59462. always had lady companions, but who they were and what they were like
59463. he never knew or remembered. "This must be one of her companions," he
59464. thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.
59465. 
59466. The princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.
59467. 
59468. "Yes," she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her
59469. hand, "so this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the very
59470. last," she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a
59471. shyness that surprised him for an instant.
59472. 
59473. "I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good
59474. news we had received for a long time."
59475. 
59476. Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more
59477. uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre
59478. interrupted her.
59479. 
59480. "Just imagine--I knew nothing about him!" said he. "I thought he had
59481. been killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know
59482. that he fell in with the Rostovs.... What a strange coincidence!"
59483. 
59484. Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the
59485. companion's face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,
59486. as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion
59487. in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not
59488. hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.
59489. 
59490. But when he mentioned the Rostovs, Princess Mary's face expressed still
59491. greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre's face to
59492. that of the lady in the black dress and said:
59493. 
59494. "Do you really not recognize her?"
59495. 
59496. Pierre looked again at the companion's pale, delicate face with its
59497. black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten
59498. and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes.
59499. 
59500. "But no, it can't be!" he thought. "This stern, thin, pale face that
59501. looks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her."
59502. But at that moment Princess Mary said, "Natasha!" And with difficulty,
59503. effort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its
59504. hinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from
59505. that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with
59506. a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been
59507. thinking--especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and
59508. enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possible,
59509. it was Natasha and he loved her.
59510. 
59511. At that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,
59512. and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware.
59513. He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his
59514. agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more clearly--clearer
59515. than any words could have done--did he betray to himself, to her, and to
59516. Princess Mary that he loved her.
59517. 
59518. "No, it's only the unexpectedness of it," thought Pierre. But as soon as
59519. he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he
59520. again glanced at Natasha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and
59521. a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He
59522. became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was
59523. saying.
59524. 
59525. Pierre had failed to notice Natasha because he did not at all expect to
59526. see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the change in
59527. her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin and pale, but
59528. that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the
59529. moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with
59530. a suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and
59531. glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes
59532. were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.
59533. 
59534. Pierre's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natasha's part,
59535. but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face.
59536. 
59537. 
59538. 
59539. 
59540. 
59541. CHAPTER XVI
59542. 
59543. 
59544. "She has come to stay with me," said Princess Mary. "The count and
59545. countess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful
59546. state; but it was necessary for Natasha herself to see a doctor. They
59547. insisted on her coming with me."
59548. 
59549. "Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?" said Pierre, addressing
59550. Natasha. "You know it happened the very day we were rescued. I saw him.
59551. What a delightful boy he was!"
59552. 
59553. Natasha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes
59554. widened and lit up.
59555. 
59556. "What can one say or think of as a consolation?" said Pierre. "Nothing!
59557. Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?"
59558. 
59559. "Yes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith..." remarked
59560. Princess Mary.
59561. 
59562. "Yes, yes, that is really true," Pierre hastily interrupted her.
59563. 
59564. "Why is it true?" Natasha asked, looking attentively into Pierre's eyes.
59565. 
59566. "How can you ask why?" said Princess Mary. "The thought alone of what
59567. awaits..."
59568. 
59569. Natasha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked
59570. inquiringly at Pierre.
59571. 
59572. "And because," Pierre continued, "only one who believes that there is a
59573. God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours."
59574. 
59575. Natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped.
59576. Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary,
59577. asking about his friend's last days.
59578. 
59579. Pierre's confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he felt
59580. that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was now a
59581. judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to
59582. him than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was
59583. considering what impression his words would make on Natasha. He did
59584. not purposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he
59585. regarded from her standpoint.
59586. 
59587. Princess Mary--reluctantly as is usual in such cases--began telling of
59588. the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But Pierre's face
59589. quivering with emotion, his questions and his eager restless expression,
59590. gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall
59591. for her own sake.
59592. 
59593. "Yes, yes, and so...?" Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with
59594. his whole body and eagerly listened to her story. "Yes, yes... so he
59595. grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought one
59596. thing--to be perfectly good--so he could not be afraid of death.
59597. The faults he had--if he had any--were not of his making. So he did
59598. soften?... What a happy thing that he saw you again," he added, suddenly
59599. turning to Natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tears.
59600. 
59601. Natasha's face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment.
59602. She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.
59603. 
59604. "Yes, that was happiness," she then said in her quiet voice with its
59605. deep chest notes. "For me it certainly was happiness." She paused. "And
59606. he... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered
59607. the room...."
59608. 
59609. Natasha's voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her
59610. knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her
59611. head and began to speak rapidly.
59612. 
59613. "We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to
59614. ask about him. Then suddenly Sonya told me he was traveling with us. I
59615. had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was
59616. to see him and be with him," she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.
59617. 
59618. And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had
59619. never yet mentioned to anyone--all she had lived through during those
59620. three weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslavl.
59621. 
59622. Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of
59623. tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of death,
59624. nor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only pity for
59625. her, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.
59626. 
59627. Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside
59628. Natasha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of
59629. her brother's and Natasha's love.
59630. 
59631. Evidently Natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.
59632. 
59633. She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of
59634. her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she
59635. repeated the same thing twice.
59636. 
59637. Dessalles' voice was heard outside the door asking whether little
59638. Nicholas might come in to say good night.
59639. 
59640. "Well, that's all--everything," said Natasha.
59641. 
59642. She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the door
59643. which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed
59644. from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.
59645. 
59646. Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not
59647. understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.
59648. 
59649. Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention
59650. to her nephew who had entered the room.
59651. 
59652. At that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas' face, which
59653. resembled his father's, affected Pierre so much that when he had kissed
59654. the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and went to the
59655. window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she would not let
59656. him go.
59657. 
59658. "No, Natasha and I sometimes don't go to sleep till after two, so please
59659. don't go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come immediately."
59660. 
59661. Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: "This is the first
59662. time she has talked of him like that."
59663. 
59664. 
59665. 
59666. 
59667. 
59668. CHAPTER XVII
59669. 
59670. 
59671. Pierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few minutes
59672. later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with Natasha. Natasha
59673. was calm, though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her
59674. face. They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness
59675. which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is
59676. impossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is
59677. awkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like
59678. affectation. They went silently to table. The footmen drew back the
59679. chairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin
59680. and, resolving to break the silence, looked at Natasha and at Princess
59681. Mary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of
59682. both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life
59683. also has joy.
59684. 
59685. "Do you take vodka, Count?" asked Princess Mary, and those words
59686. suddenly banished the shadows of the past. "Now tell us about yourself,"
59687. said she. "One hears such improbable wonders about you."
59688. 
59689. "Yes," replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him.
59690. "They even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary Abramovna
59691. invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought
59692. to have happened, to me. Stepan Stepanych also instructed me how I ought
59693. to tell of my experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very
59694. easy to be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people
59695. invite me out and tell me all about myself."
59696. 
59697. Natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking.
59698. 
59699. "We have been told," Princess Mary interrupted her, "that you lost two
59700. millions in Moscow. Is that true?"
59701. 
59702. "But I am three times as rich as before," returned Pierre.
59703. 
59704. Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife's
59705. debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had
59706. become three times as rich as before.
59707. 
59708. "What I have certainly gained is freedom," he began seriously, but did
59709. not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.
59710. 
59711. "And are you building?"
59712. 
59713. "Yes. Savelich says I must!"
59714. 
59715. "Tell me, you did not know of the countess' death when you decided to
59716. remain in Moscow?" asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing
59717. that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his
59718. words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.
59719. 
59720. "No," answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning
59721. Princess Mary had given to his words. "I heard of it in Orel and you
59722. cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple," he
59723. added quickly, glancing at Natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as
59724. to how he would speak of his wife, "but her death shocked me terribly.
59725. When two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and one's own
59726. guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer
59727. alive. And then such a death... without friends and without consolation!
59728. I am very, very sorry for her," he concluded, and was pleased to notice
59729. a look of glad approval on Natasha's face.
59730. 
59731. "Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor," said Princess
59732. Mary.
59733. 
59734. Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look
59735. at Natasha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold,
59736. stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.
59737. 
59738. "And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?"
59739. said Princess Mary.
59740. 
59741. Pierre laughed.
59742. 
59743. "No, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner
59744. means being Napoleon's guest. Not only did I never see him but I heard
59745. nothing about him--I was in much lower company!"
59746. 
59747. Supper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his
59748. captivity was gradually led on to do so.
59749. 
59750. "But it's true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?" Natasha
59751. asked with a slight smile. "I guessed it then when we met at the
59752. Sukharev tower, do you remember?"
59753. 
59754. Pierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by
59755. Princess Mary's questions and especially by Natasha's into giving a
59756. detailed account of his adventures.
59757. 
59758. At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with
59759. him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came
59760. to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was
59761. unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed
59762. emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he
59763. has lived through.
59764. 
59765. Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at
59766. Natasha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness.
59767. Natasha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly
59768. changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never
59769. wandered--evidently herself experiencing all that he described. Not only
59770. her look, but her exclamations and the brief questions she put, showed
59771. Pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey. It was clear
59772. that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to,
59773. but could not, express in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident
59774. with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was
59775. this: "It was an awful sight--children abandoned, some in the flames...
59776. One was snatched out before my eyes... and there were women who had
59777. their things snatched off and their earrings torn out..." he flushed
59778. and grew confused. "Then a patrol arrived and all the men--all those who
59779. were not looting, that is--were arrested, and I among them."
59780. 
59781. "I am sure you're not telling us everything; I am sure you did
59782. something..." said Natasha and pausing added, "something fine?"
59783. 
59784. Pierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass
59785. over the horrible details, but Natasha insisted that he should not omit
59786. anything.
59787. 
59788. Pierre began to tell about Karataev, but paused. By this time he had
59789. risen from the table and was pacing the room, Natasha following him with
59790. her eyes. Then he added:
59791. 
59792. "No, you can't understand what I learned from that illiterate man--that
59793. simple fellow."
59794. 
59795. "Yes, yes, go on!" said Natasha. "Where is he?"
59796. 
59797. "They killed him almost before my eyes."
59798. 
59799. And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last
59800. days of their retreat, of Karataev's illness and his death.
59801. 
59802. He told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now, as
59803. it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that he was
59804. telling it all to Natasha he experienced that pleasure which a man has
59805. when women listen to him--not clever women who when listening either try
59806. to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity
59807. offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their
59808. own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their
59809. little mental workshop--but the pleasure given by real women gifted with
59810. a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself.
59811. Natasha without knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word,
59812. no single quiver in Pierre's voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in
59813. his face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its
59814. flight and took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret
59815. meaning of all Pierre's mental travail.
59816. 
59817. Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she
59818. now saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the
59819. possibility of love and happiness between Natasha and Pierre, and the
59820. first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.
59821. 
59822. It was three o'clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad and
59823. stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.
59824. 
59825. Pierre finished his story. Natasha continued to look at him intently
59826. with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand
59827. something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced
59828. and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what
59829. to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It
59830. occurred to none of them that it was three o'clock and time to go to
59831. bed.
59832. 
59833. "People speak of misfortunes and sufferings," remarked Pierre, "but if
59834. at this moment I were asked: 'Would you rather be what you were before
59835. you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?' then for
59836. heaven's sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine
59837. that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is
59838. only then that what is new and good begins. While there is life there is
59839. happiness. There is much, much before us. I say this to you," he added,
59840. turning to Natasha.
59841. 
59842. "Yes, yes," she said, answering something quite different. "I too should
59843. wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning."
59844. 
59845. Pierre looked intently at her.
59846. 
59847. "Yes, and nothing more," said Natasha.
59848. 
59849. "It's not true, not true!" cried Pierre. "I am not to blame for being
59850. alive and wishing to live--nor you either."
59851. 
59852. Suddenly Natasha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and
59853. began to cry.
59854. 
59855. "What is it, Natasha?" said Princess Mary.
59856. 
59857. "Nothing, nothing." She smiled at Pierre through her tears. "Good night!
59858. It is time for bed."
59859. 
59860. Pierre rose and took his leave.
59861. 
59862. 
59863. Princess Mary and Natasha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of
59864. what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of
59865. Pierre nor did Natasha speak of him.
59866. 
59867. "Well, good night, Mary!" said Natasha. "Do you know, I am often afraid
59868. that by not speaking of him" (she meant Prince Andrew) "for fear of not
59869. doing justice to our feelings, we forget him."
59870. 
59871. Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of
59872. Natasha's remark, but she did not express agreement in words.
59873. 
59874. "Is it possible to forget?" said she.
59875. 
59876. "It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and
59877. painful, but good, very good!" said Natasha. "I am sure he really loved
59878. him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?" she added, suddenly
59879. blushing.
59880. 
59881. "To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!" said Princess
59882. Mary.
59883. 
59884. "Do you know, Mary..." Natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smile
59885. such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, "he has
59886. somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh--as if he had just come out of
59887. a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn't it true?"
59888. 
59889. "Yes," replied Princess Mary. "He has greatly improved."
59890. 
59891. "With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he
59892. had come straight from the bath... Papa used to..."
59893. 
59894. "I understand why he" (Prince Andrew) "liked no one so much as him,"
59895. said Princess Mary.
59896. 
59897. "Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when
59898. they are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike
59899. him--in everything."
59900. 
59901. "Yes, but he's wonderful."
59902. 
59903. "Well, good night," said Natasha.
59904. 
59905. And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as
59906. if it had been forgotten there.
59907. 
59908. 
59909. 
59910. 
59911. 
59912. CHAPTER XVIII
59913. 
59914. 
59915. It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced
59916. up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem
59917. and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now
59918. smiling happily.
59919. 
59920. He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natasha, and of their love, at one
59921. moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling.
59922. It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the
59923. room.
59924. 
59925. "Well, what's to be done if it cannot be avoided? What's to be done?
59926. Evidently it has to be so," said he to himself, and hastily undressing
59927. he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or
59928. indecision.
59929. 
59930. "Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything
59931. that she and I may be man and wife," he told himself.
59932. 
59933. A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the
59934. Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savelich came to ask him about
59935. packing for the journey.
59936. 
59937. "What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?"
59938. he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. "Oh, yes, long ago
59939. before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,"
59940. he reflected. "Why? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is and
59941. how attentive, and how he remembers everything," he thought, looking at
59942. Savelich's old face, "and what a pleasant smile he has!"
59943. 
59944. "Well, Savelich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?" Pierre
59945. asked him.
59946. 
59947. "What's the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under the
59948. late count--the kingdom of heaven be his!--and we have lived under you
59949. too, without ever being wronged."
59950. 
59951. "And your children?"
59952. 
59953. "The children will live just the same. With such masters one can live."
59954. 
59955. "But what about my heirs?" said Pierre. "Supposing I suddenly marry...
59956. it might happen," he added with an involuntary smile.
59957. 
59958. "If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing."
59959. 
59960. "How easy he thinks it," thought Pierre. "He doesn't know how terrible
59961. it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!"
59962. 
59963. "So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?" asked Savelich.
59964. 
59965. "No, I'll put it off for a bit. I'll tell you later. You must forgive
59966. the trouble I have put you to," said Pierre, and seeing Savelich smile,
59967. he thought: "But how strange it is that he should not know that now
59968. there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of
59969. all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall
59970. I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?" Pierre reflected. "No,
59971. another time."
59972. 
59973. At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to
59974. see Princess Mary the day before and had there met--"Whom do you think?
59975. Natasha Rostova!"
59976. 
59977. The princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he
59978. had seen Anna Semenovna.
59979. 
59980. "Do you know her?" asked Pierre.
59981. 
59982. "I have seen the princess," she replied. "I heard that they were
59983. arranging a match for her with young Rostov. It would be a very good
59984. thing for the Rostovs, they are said to be utterly ruined."
59985. 
59986. "No; I mean do you know Natasha Rostova?"
59987. 
59988. "I heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity."
59989. 
59990. "No, she either doesn't understand or is pretending," thought Pierre.
59991. "Better not say anything to her either."
59992. 
59993. The princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre's journey.
59994. 
59995. "How kind they all are," thought Pierre. "What is surprising is that
59996. they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of
59997. interest to them. And all for me!"
59998. 
59999. On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send
60000. a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be
60001. returned to their owners that day.
60002. 
60003. "And this man too," thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief
60004. of Police. "What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy
60005. bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest
60006. and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn't he take bribes?
60007. That's the way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a
60008. kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me."
60009. 
60010. Pierre went to Princess Mary's to dinner.
60011. 
60012. As he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned
60013. down, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness
60014. of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters
60015. of the town, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of
60016. the Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers,
60017. the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women
60018. hawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked at him with cheerful beaming
60019. eyes that seemed to say: "Ah, there he is! Let's see what will come of
60020. it!"
60021. 
60022. At the entrance to Princess Mary's house Pierre felt doubtful whether
60023. he had really been there the night before and really seen Natasha and
60024. talked to her. "Perhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find
60025. no one there." But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her
60026. presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom. She
60027. was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the
60028. same way as the day before, yet she was quite different. Had she been
60029. like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have
60030. failed to recognize her.
60031. 
60032. She was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince
60033. Andrew's fiancee. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on
60034. her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.
60035. 
60036. Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there, but
60037. Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.
60038. 
60039. Next day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though
60040. Princess Mary and Natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and
60041. though all Pierre's interest was now centered in that house, by the
60042. evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from
60043. one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long
60044. that Princess Mary and Natasha exchanged glances, evidently wondering
60045. when he would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy
60046. and embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take
60047. his leave.
60048. 
60049. Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of
60050. a headache began to say good night.
60051. 
60052. "So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?" she asked.
60053. 
60054. "No, I am not going," Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as
60055. though offended. "Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow--but I won't say
60056. good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,"
60057. said he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking
60058. his departure.
60059. 
60060. Natasha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other hand
60061. instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and
60062. intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she
60063. had plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and
60064. long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.
60065. 
60066. When Natasha left the room Pierre's confusion and awkwardness
60067. immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly
60068. moved an armchair toward Princess Mary.
60069. 
60070. "Yes, I wanted to tell you," said he, answering her look as if she had
60071. spoken. "Princess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my
60072. dear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I
60073. know it's impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to
60074. her. No, not that, I don't, I can't..."
60075. 
60076. He paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.
60077. 
60078. "Well," he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence.
60079. "I don't know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her
60080. alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without
60081. her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that
60082. perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that
60083. possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope?
60084. Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!" he added after a pause, and
60085. touched her hand as she did not reply.
60086. 
60087. "I am thinking of what you have told me," answered Princess Mary.
60088. "This is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at
60089. present..."
60090. 
60091. Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was
60092. impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change
60093. in Natasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre
60094. spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for.
60095. 
60096. "To speak to her now wouldn't do," said the princess all the same.
60097. 
60098. "But what am I to do?"
60099. 
60100. "Leave it to me," said Princess Mary. "I know..."
60101. 
60102. Pierre was looking into Princess Mary's eyes.
60103. 
60104. "Well?... Well?..." he said.
60105. 
60106. "I know that she loves... will love you," Princess Mary corrected
60107. herself.
60108. 
60109. Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened
60110. expression seized Princess Mary's hand.
60111. 
60112. "What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?"
60113. 
60114. "Yes, I think so," said Princess Mary with a smile. "Write to her
60115. parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to
60116. happen and my heart tells me it will."
60117. 
60118. "No, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can't be.... How happy I am!
60119. No, it can't be!" Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary's hands.
60120. 
60121. "Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you," she
60122. said.
60123. 
60124. "To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I'll go. But I may come again
60125. tomorrow?"
60126. 
60127. Next day Pierre came to say good-by. Natasha was less animated than
60128. she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre
60129. sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she
60130. existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. "Is it possible?
60131. No, it can't be," he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that
60132. filled his soul with joy.
60133. 
60134. When on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help
60135. holding it a little longer in his own.
60136. 
60137. "Is it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure
60138. of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that it will one
60139. day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, that's
60140. impossible!..."
60141. 
60142. "Good-by, Count," she said aloud. "I shall look forward very much to
60143. your return," she added in a whisper.
60144. 
60145. And these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face which
60146. accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible
60147. memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for Pierre. "'I shall
60148. look forward very much to your return....' Yes, yes, how did she say it?
60149. Yes, 'I shall look forward very much to your return.' Oh, how happy I
60150. am! What is happening to me? How happy I am!" said Pierre to himself.
60151. 
60152. 
60153. 
60154. 
60155. 
60156. CHAPTER XIX
60157. 
60158. 
60159. There was nothing in Pierre's soul now at all like what had troubled it
60160. during his courtship of Helene.
60161. 
60162. He did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words
60163. he had spoken, or say: "Oh, why did I not say that?" and, "Whatever made
60164. me say 'Je vous aime'?" On the contrary, he now repeated in imagination
60165. every word that he or Natasha had spoken and pictured every detail of
60166. her face and smile, and did not wish to diminish or add anything, but
60167. only to repeat it again and again. There was now not a shadow of doubt
60168. in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong.
60169. Only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: "Wasn't it all
60170. a dream? Isn't Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and
60171. self-confident? I believe all this--and suddenly Princess Mary will tell
60172. her, and she will be sure to smile and say: 'How strange! He must be
60173. deluding himself. Doesn't he know that he is a man, just a man, while
60174. I...? I am something altogether different and higher.'"
60175. 
60176. That was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any
60177. plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only
60178. he could attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended
60179. with that.
60180. 
60181. A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable,
60182. possessed him. The whole meaning of life--not for him alone but for the
60183. whole world--seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of
60184. being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with
60185. one thing only--his future happiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that
60186. other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to
60187. hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests. In
60188. every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He often
60189. surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which
60190. seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. And when
60191. he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied
60192. them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them
60193. that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of
60194. attention.
60195. 
60196. When it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service,
60197. or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the
60198. assumption that everybody's welfare depended on this or that issue
60199. of events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise
60200. people by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everybody--both
60201. those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of life (that
60202. is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not
60203. understand it--in the bright light of the emotion that shone within
60204. himself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met
60205. everything that was good and worthy of being loved.
60206. 
60207. When dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her memory
60208. aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he
60209. now knew. Prince Vasili, who having obtained a new post and some
60210. fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed to him a
60211. pathetic, kindly old man much to be pitied.
60212. 
60213. Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity. All
60214. the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true
60215. for him always. He not only did not renounce them subsequently, but when
60216. he was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he referred to the views he had
60217. held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct.
60218. 
60219. "I may have appeared strange and queer then," he thought, "but I was
60220. not so mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wiser and had
60221. more insight than at any other time, and understood all that is worth
60222. understanding in life, because... because I was happy."
60223. 
60224. Pierre's insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to
60225. discover personal attributes which he termed "good qualities" in people
60226. before loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love, and by
60227. loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving
60228. them.
60229. 
60230. 
60231. 
60232. 
60233. 
60234. CHAPTER XX
60235. 
60236. 
60237. After Pierre's departure that first evening, when Natasha had said to
60238. Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: "He looks just, yes, just as
60239. if he had come out of a Russian bath--in a short coat and with his hair
60240. cropped," something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepressible,
60241. awoke in Natasha's soul.
60242. 
60243. Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.
60244. To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the
60245. surface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to have
60246. forgotten all that had happened to her. She no longer complained of her
60247. position, did not say a word about the past, and no longer feared to
60248. make happy plans for the future. She spoke little of Pierre, but when
60249. Princess Mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled
60250. in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile.
60251. 
60252. The change that took place in Natasha at first surprised Princess Mary;
60253. but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. "Can she have loved
60254. my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?" she thought
60255. when she reflected on the change. But when she was with Natasha she was
60256. not vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reawakened power
60257. of life that had seized Natasha was so evidently irrepressible and
60258. unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had
60259. no right to reproach her even in her heart.
60260. 
60261.  Natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling
60262. that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but
60263. bright and cheerful.
60264. 
60265. When Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with
60266. Pierre, Natasha met her on the threshold.
60267. 
60268. "He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?" she repeated.
60269. 
60270. And a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for
60271. her joy settled on Natasha's face.
60272. 
60273. "I wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me."
60274. 
60275. Understandable and touching as the look with which Natasha gazed at
60276. her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation,
60277. these words pained her for a moment. She remembered her brother and his
60278. love.
60279. 
60280. "But what's to be done? She can't help it," thought the princess.
60281. 
60282. And with a sad and rather stern look she told Natasha all that Pierre
60283. had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Natasha was
60284. astounded.
60285. 
60286. "To Petersburg!" she repeated as if unable to understand.
60287. 
60288. But noticing the grieved expression on Princess Mary's face she guessed
60289. the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.
60290. 
60291. "Mary," said she, "tell me what I should do! I am afraid of being bad.
60292. Whatever you tell me, I will do. Tell me...."
60293. 
60294. "You love him?"
60295. 
60296. "Yes," whispered Natasha.
60297. 
60298. "Then why are you crying? I am happy for your sake," said Princess Mary,
60299. who because of those tears quite forgave Natasha's joy.
60300. 
60301. "It won't be just yet--someday. Think what fun it will be when I am his
60302. wife and you marry Nicholas!"
60303. 
60304. "Natasha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about you."
60305. 
60306. They were silent awhile.
60307. 
60308. "But why go to Petersburg?" Natasha suddenly asked, and hastily replied
60309. to her own question. "But no, no, he must... Yes, Mary, He must...."
60310. 
60311. 
60312.

60316. 
60317. 
60318. 
60319. 
60320. 
60321. CHAPTER I
60322. 
60323. 
60324. Seven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had
60325. subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the
60326. mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of
60327. their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.
60328. 
60329. Though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the movement
60330. of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups
60331. of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of
60332. kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation.
60333. 
60334. The sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as
60335. previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures were not
60336. borne by the waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed
60337. to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies,
60338. who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars,
60339. campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless movement by political
60340. and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.
60341. 
60342. The historians call this activity of the historical figures "the
60343. reaction."
60344. 
60345. In dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical
60346. personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the
60347. reaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and
60348. Napoleon to Madame de Stael, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Chateaubriand,
60349. and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or
60350. condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction.
60351. 
60352. According to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia
60353. also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who according
60354. to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement
60355. of his reign, being the savior of Russia.
60356. 
60357. There is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to
60358. learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for
60359. things he did wrong at this period of his reign.
60360. 
60361. "He ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he did
60362. well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of
60363. his reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution
60364. to Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to Arakcheev,
60365. favoring Golitsyn and mysticism, and afterwards Shishkov and Photius.
60366. He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and
60367. disbanding the Semenov regiment."
60368. 
60369. It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the
60370. historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for
60371. humanity.
60372. 
60373. What do these reproaches mean?
60374. 
60375. Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I
60376. (the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with
60377. Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)
60378. flow from the same sources--the circumstances of his birth, education,
60379. and life--that made his personality what it was and from which the
60380. actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of
60381. Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed?
60382. 
60383. In what does the substance of those reproaches lie?
60384. 
60385. It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I,
60386. standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the
60387. blinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those
60388. strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception
60389. inseparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life
60390. felt a responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not
60391. a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal
60392. habits, passions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth--that
60393. this character--though not lacking in virtue (the historians do not
60394. accuse him of that)--had not the same conception of the welfare of
60395. humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his
60396. youth upwards has been occupied with learning: that is, with books and
60397. lectures and with taking notes from them.
60398. 
60399. But even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was mistaken in
60400. his view of what was good for the people, we must inevitably assume that
60401. the historian who judges Alexander will also after the lapse of some
60402. time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity.
60403. This assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because, watching
60404. the movement of history, we see that every year and with each new
60405. writer, opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what
60406. once seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. And what is
60407. more, we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to
60408. what is bad and what is good in history: some people regard giving a
60409. constitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in
60410. Alexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.
60411. 
60412. The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or
60413. harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful.
60414. If that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does
60415. not agree with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the
60416. preservation of my father's house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian
60417. arms, or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the
60418. freedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in
60419. Europe, or a certain kind of European culture called "progress" appear
60420. to me to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these things the
60421. action of every historic character has other more general purposes
60422. inaccessible to me.
60423. 
60424. But let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all
60425. contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by
60426. which to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander
60427. could have done everything differently; let us say that with guidance
60428. from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the
60429. movement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to the
60430. program his present accusers would have given him--of nationality,
60431. freedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground). Let
60432. us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated,
60433. and that Alexander had acted on it. What would then have become of the
60434. activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in
60435. the government--an activity that in the opinion of the historians was
60436. good and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would
60437. have been no life, there would have been nothing.
60438. 
60439. If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of
60440. life is destroyed.
60441. 
60442. 
60443. 
60444. 
60445. 
60446. CHAPTER II
60447. 
60448. 
60449. If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the
60450. attainment of certain ends--the greatness of Russia or of France,
60451. the balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of the
60452. Revolution, general progress, or anything else--then it is impossible
60453. to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of
60454. chance and genius.
60455. 
60456. If the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth
60457. century had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might have been
60458. accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion. If
60459. the aim was the aggrandizement of France, that might have been attained
60460. without the Revolution and without the Empire. If the aim was the
60461. dissemination of ideas, the printing press could have accomplished that
60462. much better than warfare. If the aim was the progress of civilization,
60463. it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization
60464. more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives.
60465. 
60466. Why did it happen in this and not in some other way?
60467. 
60468. Because it happened so! "Chance created the situation; genius utilized
60469. it," says history.
60470. 
60471. But what is chance? What is genius?
60472. 
60473. The words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and
60474. therefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote a certain stage of
60475. understanding of phenomena. I do not know why a certain event occurs; I
60476. think that I cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about
60477. chance. I see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary
60478. human agencies; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk of
60479. genius.
60480. 
60481. To a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a
60482. special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others
60483. must seem to be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction
60484. of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram,
60485. who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into
60486. a special enclosure where there are oats--that this very ram, swelling
60487. with fat, is killed for meat.
60488. 
60489. But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them
60490. happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only
60491. admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken,
60492. and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened
60493. to the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not know for what purpose
60494. they are fattened, they will at least know that all that happened to the
60495. ram did not happen accidentally, and will no longer need the conceptions
60496. of chance or genius.
60497. 
60498. Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately
60499. intelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our
60500. ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of
60501. historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce
60502. (incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then the words
60503. chance and genius become superfluous.
60504. 
60505. We need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European
60506. convulsions and that we know only the facts--that is, the murders, first
60507. in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain,
60508. and in Russia--and that the movements from the west to the east and from
60509. the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and
60510. not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in
60511. Napoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to
60512. be anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have
60513. recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made
60514. these people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small
60515. events were inevitable.
60516. 
60517. By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall
60518. clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for
60519. any single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it is
60520. impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the
60521. smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than Napoleon and
60522. Alexander with all their antecedents.
60523. 
60524. 
60525. 
60526. 
60527. 
60528. CHAPTER III
60529. 
60530. 
60531. The fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the
60532. beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of
60533. the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west.
60534. The commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east.
60535. For the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement
60536. to Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves into
60537. a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike
60538. military group of the east, (2) that they should abandon all established
60539. traditions and customs, and (3) that during their military movement they
60540. should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them
60541. the deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have to be committed
60542. during that movement.
60543. 
60544. And beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately large
60545. group was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions, and step
60546. by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and
60547. traditions, and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the
60548. coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done.
60549. 
60550. A man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, without
60551. a name, and not even a Frenchman, emerges--by what seem the strangest
60552. chances--from among all the seething French parties, and without joining
60553. any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position.
60554. 
60555. The ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance of
60556. his opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling and
60557. self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the
60558. army. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to Italy,
60559. his opponents' reluctance to fight, and his own childish audacity and
60560. self-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable so called chances
60561. accompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he falls with the
60562. rulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to avoid his
60563. predestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian
60564. service, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing. During
60565. the war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and
60566. each time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various diplomatic
60567. considerations the Russian armies--just those which might have destroyed
60568. his prestige--do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there.
60569. 
60570. On his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process
60571. of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped
60572. out and destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerous position
60573. presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition
60574. to Africa. Again so-called chance accompanies him. Impregnable Malta
60575. surrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes are crowned with
60576. success. The enemy's fleet, which subsequently did not let a single boat
60577. pass, allows his entire army to elude it. In Africa a whole series of
60578. outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants. And the
60579. men who commit these crimes, especially their leader, assure themselves
60580. that this is admirable, this is glory--it resembles Caesar and Alexander
60581. the Great and is therefore good.
60582. 
60583. This ideal of glory and grandeur--which consists not merely in
60584. considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every
60585. crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural
60586. significance--that ideal, destined to guide this man and his associates,
60587. had scope for its development in Africa. Whatever he does succeeds. The
60588. plague does not touch him. The cruelty of murdering prisoners is not
60589. imputed to him as a fault. His childishly rash, uncalled-for, and
60590. ignoble departure from Africa, leaving his comrades in distress, is
60591. set down to his credit, and again the enemy's fleet twice lets him slip
60592. past. When, intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully,
60593. he reaches Paris, the dissolution of the republican government, which a
60594. year earlier might have ruined him, has reached its extreme limit, and
60595. his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can
60596. only serve to exalt him--and though he himself has no plan, he is quite
60597. ready for his new role.
60598. 
60599. He had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties snatched at
60600. him and demanded his participation.
60601. 
60602. He alone--with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy and
60603. Egypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime and frankness in
60604. lying--he alone could justify what had to be done.
60605. 
60606. He is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from
60607. his will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his
60608. mistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and
60609. the conspiracy is crowned with success.
60610. 
60611. He is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he wishes to
60612. flee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon and
60613. says senseless things that should have ruined him. But the once proud
60614. and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played out, are
60615. even more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they should have
60616. said to destroy him and retain their power.
60617. 
60618. Chance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by
60619. agreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the characters
60620. of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms the character
60621. of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance contrives
60622. a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his
60623. power. Chance puts the Duc d'Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly
60624. causes him to kill him--thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than
60625. in any other way that he had the right, since he had the might.
60626. Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an
60627. expedition against England (which would inevitably have ruined him) he
60628. never carries out that intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and
60629. the Austrians, who surrender without a battle. Chance and genius give
60630. him the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance all men, not only the
60631. French but all Europe--except England which does not take part in the
60632. events about to happen--despite their former horror and detestation of
60633. his crimes, now recognize his authority, the title he has given
60634. himself, and his ideal of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and
60635. reasonable to them all.
60636. 
60637. As if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, the
60638. western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 1807,
60639. and 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of people that
60640. had formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Central
60641. Europe. The strength of the justification of the man who stands at the
60642. head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group. During
60643. the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all
60644. the crowned heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the world can
60645. oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of
60646. glory and grandeur. One after another they hasten to display their
60647. insignificance before him. The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek
60648. the great man's mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that
60649. this man receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the
60650. guardian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the
60651. aggrandizement of the great man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself
60652. for the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him who
60653. prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is
60654. happening and has to happen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud
60655. he commits, which in the mouths of those around him is not at once
60656. represented as a great deed. The most suitable fete the Germans can
60657. devise for him is a celebration of Jena and Auerstadt. Not only is he
60658. great, but so are his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his
60659. brothers-in-law. Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his
60660. reason and to prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so
60661. too are the forces.
60662. 
60663. The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal--Moscow. That
60664. city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing
60665. armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram. But
60666. suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had
60667. so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the
60668. predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur--from
60669. the cold in his head at Borodino to the sparks which set Moscow on
60670. fire, and the frosts--and instead of genius, stupidity and immeasurable
60671. baseness become evident.
60672. 
60673. The invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now
60674. not for Napoleon but always against him.
60675. 
60676. A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a
60677. remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.
60678. Attempted drives from east to west--similar to the contrary movements of
60679. 1805, 1807, and 1809--precede the great westward movement; there is the
60680. same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion
60681. of the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation
60682. midway, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.
60683. 
60684. Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army
60685. are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his
60686. actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance
60687. occurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of
60688. their sufferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his
60689. craft exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten
60690. years previously and one year later--an outlawed brigand. But by some
60691. strange chance no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man
60692. who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand
60693. is sent to an island two days' sail from France, which for some reason
60694. is presented to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and
60695. millions of money are paid him.
60696. 
60697. 
60698. 
60699. 
60700. 
60701. CHAPTER IV
60702. 
60703. 
60704. The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. The
60705. waves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies are
60706. formed in which float the diplomatists, who imagine that they have
60707. caused the floods to abate.
60708. 
60709. But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists
60710. think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure
60711. of natural forces; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the
60712. position seems to them insoluble. But the wave they feel to be rising
60713. does not come from the quarter they expect. It rises again from the same
60714. point as before--Paris. The last backwash of the movement from the west
60715. occurs: a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable
60716. diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of
60717. history.
60718. 
60719. The man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any
60720. conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by
60721. strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they
60722. cursed the day before and will curse again a month later.
60723. 
60724. This man is still needed to justify the final collective act.
60725. 
60726. That act is performed.
60727. 
60728. The last role is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his
60729. powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.
60730. 
60731. And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself
60732. in solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues and lies
60733. when the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to the whole
60734. world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an
60735. unseen hand directed his actions.
60736. 
60737. The manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor
60738. shows him to us.
60739. 
60740. "See what you believed in! This is he! Do you now see that it was not he
60741. but I who moved you?"
60742. 
60743. But dazed by the force of the movement, it was long before people
60744. understood this.
60745. 
60746. Still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of
60747. Alexander I, the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from
60748. east to west.
60749. 
60750. What was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the head of
60751. that movement from east to west?
60752. 
60753. What was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with European
60754. affairs, but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; a moral
60755. superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated with him;
60756. a mild and attractive personality; and a personal grievance against
60757. Napoleon. And all this was found in Alexander I; all this had been
60758. prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: his education,
60759. his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by
60760. Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.
60761. 
60762. During the national war he was inactive because he was not needed. But
60763. as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he
60764. appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the nations of
60765. Europe, led them to the goal.
60766. 
60767. The goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all
60768. possible power. How does he use it?
60769. 
60770. Alexander I--the pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early years
60771. had striven only for his people's welfare, the originator of the liberal
60772. innovations in his fatherland--now that he seemed to possess the utmost
60773. power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the
60774. welfare of his peoples--at the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing
60775. up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy
60776. had he retained power--Alexander I, having fulfilled his mission and
60777. feeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance
60778. of that supposed power, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands
60779. of contemptible men whom he despises, saying only:
60780. 
60781. "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!... I too am a man like the
60782. rest of you. Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of God."
60783. 
60784. As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself, and
60785. yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to
60786. comprehend, so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet
60787. has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man.
60788. 
60789. A bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is afraid
60790. of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the
60791. bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the
60792. fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from
60793. flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey.
60794. Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely
60795. says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear
60796. a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices
60797. that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil
60798. fertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the bee's
60799. existence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the
60800. bee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose of the
60801. bee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first,
60802. the second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern. The
60803. higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes,
60804. the more obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond our
60805. comprehension.
60806. 
60807. All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to
60808. other manifestations of life. And so it is with the purpose of historic
60809. characters and nations.

60813. 
60814. 
60815. CHAPTER V
60816. 
60817. 
60818. Natasha's wedding to Bezukhov, which took place in 1813, was the last
60819. happy event in the family of the old Rostovs. Count Ilya Rostov died
60820. that same year and, as always happens, after the father's death the
60821. family group broke up.
60822. 
60823. The events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the flight
60824. from it, the death of Prince Andrew, Natasha's despair, Petya's death,
60825. and the old countess' grief fell blow after blow on the old count's
60826. head. He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these
60827. events, and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and
60828. inviting further blows which would finish him. He seemed now frightened
60829. and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising.
60830. 
60831. The arrangements for Natasha's marriage occupied him for a while. He
60832. ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but
60833. his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it
60834. evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him.
60835. 
60836. When Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and began to
60837. complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his
60838. bed. He realized from the first that he would not get up again, despite
60839. the doctor's encouragement. The countess passed a fortnight in an
60840. armchair by his pillow without undressing. Every time she gave him
60841. his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand. On his last day,
60842. sobbing, he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having
60843. dissipated their property--that being the chief fault of which he was
60844. conscious. After receiving communion and unction he quietly died; and
60845. next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects
60846. to the deceased filled the house rented by the Rostovs. All these
60847. acquaintances, who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so
60848. often laughed at him, now said, with a common feeling of self-reproach
60849. and emotion, as if justifying themselves: "Well, whatever he may have
60850. been he was a most worthy man. You don't meet such men nowadays.... And
60851. which of us has not weaknesses of his own?"
60852. 
60853. It was just when the count's affairs had become so involved that it was
60854. impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he
60855. unexpectedly died.
60856. 
60857. Nicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his
60858. father's death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, and
60859. without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to
60860. Moscow. The state of the count's affairs became quite obvious a month
60861. after his death, surprising everyone by the immense total of small
60862. debts the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts amounted to
60863. double the value of the property.
60864. 
60865. Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But
60866. he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father's memory, which he
60867. held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the
60868. inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts.
60869. 
60870. The creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague
60871. but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the count's
60872. careless good nature, all proceeded to enforce their claims at once. As
60873. always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get
60874. paid first, and those who like Mitenka held promissory notes given them
60875. as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors. Nicholas was
60876. allowed no respite and no peace, and those who had seemed to pity
60877. the old man--the cause of their losses (if they were losses)--now
60878. remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the
60879. debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them.
60880. 
60881. Not one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold by
60882. auction for half its value, and half the debts still remained
60883. unpaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his
60884. brother-in-law Bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due
60885. for value received. And to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder, as
60886. the creditors threatened, he re-entered the government service.
60887. 
60888. He could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at
60889. the next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on
60890. life; and so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people who
60891. had known him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service,
60892. he accepted a post in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform of
60893. which he was so fond, and moved with his mother and Sonya to a small
60894. house on the Sivtsev Vrazhek.
60895. 
60896. Natasha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had no
60897. clear idea of Nicholas' circumstances. Having borrowed money from his
60898. brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him.
60899. His position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve
60900. hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and Sonya,
60901. but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. The
60902. countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she
60903. had been used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it was
60904. for her son, kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep) to
60905. send for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself, or
60906. wine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for Natasha or
60907. Sonya, or for Nicholas himself.
60908. 
60909. Sonya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her
60910. whims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty
60911. from the old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted
60912. to Sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her
60913. patience and devotion, but tried to keep aloof from her.
60914. 
60915. He seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, and
60916. because there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all that people
60917. are valued for, but little that could have made him love her. He felt
60918. that the more he valued her the less he loved her. He had taken her at
60919. her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all
60920. that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in
60921. any case be renewed.
60922. 
60923. Nicholas' position became worse and worse. The idea of putting something
60924. aside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did he not save
60925. anything, but to comply with his mother's demands he even incurred some
60926. small debts. He could see no way out of this situation. The idea of
60927. marrying some rich woman, which was suggested to him by his female
60928. relations, was repugnant to him. The other way out--his mother's
60929. death--never entered his head. He wished for nothing and hoped
60930. for nothing, and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern
60931. satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position. He tried
60932. to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive
60933. offers of assistance; he avoided all distraction and recreation, and
60934. even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother, pace silently
60935. up and down the room, and smoke one pipe after another. He seemed
60936. carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled
60937. him to endure his position.
60938. 
60939. 
60940. 
60941. 
60942. 
60943. CHAPTER VI
60944. 
60945. 
60946. At the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow. From reports
60947. current in town she learned how the Rostovs were situated, and how "the
60948. son has sacrificed himself for his mother," as people were saying.
60949. 
60950. "I never expected anything else of him," said Princess Mary to herself,
60951. feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her friendly
60952. relations with all the Rostovs which had made her almost a member of the
60953. family, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But remembering her
60954. relations with Nicholas in Voronezh she was shy about doing so. Making
60955. a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her
60956. arrival in Moscow.
60957. 
60958. Nicholas was the first to meet her, as the countess' room could only be
60959. reached through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she
60960. had expected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold, stiff,
60961. proud expression she had not seen on it before. He inquired about her
60962. health, led the way to his mother, and having sat there for five minutes
60963. left the room.
60964. 
60965. When the princess came out of the countess' room Nicholas met her again,
60966. and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom.
60967. To her remarks about his mother's health he made no reply. "What's that
60968. to you? Leave me in peace," his looks seemed to say.
60969. 
60970. "Why does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can't bear these
60971. ladies and all these civilities!" said he aloud in Sonya's presence,
60972. evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princess' carriage
60973. had disappeared.
60974. 
60975. "Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?" cried Sonya, hardly able to
60976. conceal her delight. "She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!"
60977. 
60978. Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any
60979. more. But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a
60980. day.
60981. 
60982. She sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her, expressed
60983. a wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored when she
60984. began to talk about her.
60985. 
60986. Nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess,
60987. but his silence irritated her.
60988. 
60989. "She is a very admirable and excellent young woman," said she, "and you
60990. must go and call on her. You would at least be seeing somebody, and I
60991. think it must be dull for you only seeing us."
60992. 
60993. "But I don't in the least want to, Mamma."
60994. 
60995. "You used to want to, and now you don't. Really I don't understand you,
60996. my dear. One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see anyone."
60997. 
60998. "But I never said I was dull."
60999. 
61000. "Why, you said yourself you don't want even to see her. She is a very
61001. admirable young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you
61002. have got some notion or other in your head. You hide everything from
61003. me."
61004. 
61005. "Not at all, Mamma."
61006. 
61007. "If I were asking you to do something disagreeable now--but I only ask
61008. you to return a call. One would think mere politeness required it....
61009. Well, I have asked you, and now I won't interfere any more since you
61010. have secrets from your mother."
61011. 
61012. "Well, then, I'll go if you wish it."
61013. 
61014. "It doesn't matter to me. I only wish it for your sake."
61015. 
61016. Nicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a
61017. patience, trying to divert his mother's attention to another topic.
61018. 
61019. The same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the
61020. day after that.
61021. 
61022. After her visit to the Rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by
61023. Nicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had been right in
61024. not wishing to be the first to call.
61025. 
61026. "I expected nothing else," she told herself, calling her pride to her
61027. aid. "I have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the
61028. old lady, who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many
61029. obligations."
61030. 
61031. But she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin
61032. to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. Though she had
61033. firmly resolved not to call on the Rostovs again and to forget the whole
61034. matter, she felt herself all the time in an awkward position. And when
61035. she asked herself what distressed her, she had to admit that it was her
61036. relation to Rostov. His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling
61037. for her (she knew that) but it concealed something, and until she could
61038. discover what that something was, she felt that she could not be at
61039. ease.
61040. 
61041. One day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her
61042. nephew's lessons, she was informed that Rostov had called. With a firm
61043. resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent
61044. for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.
61045. 
61046. Her first glance at Nicholas' face told her that he had only come to
61047. fulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain
61048. the tone in which he addressed her.
61049. 
61050. They spoke of the countess' health, of their mutual friends, of the
61051. latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had
61052. elapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say good-by.
61053. 
61054. With Mademoiselle Bourienne's help the princess had maintained the
61055. conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose,
61056. she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her
61057. mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little
61058. happiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still, her
61059. luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had risen.
61060. 
61061. Nicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her
61062. abstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then
61063. again looked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of
61064. suffering on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was
61065. vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face
61066. expressed. He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could
61067. think of nothing to say.
61068. 
61069. "Good-by, Princess!" said he.
61070. 
61071. She started, flushed, and sighed deeply.
61072. 
61073. "Oh, I beg your pardon," she said as if waking up. "Are you going
61074. already, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the
61075. countess!"
61076. 
61077. "Wait a moment, I'll fetch it," said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she
61078. left the room.
61079. 
61080. They both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.
61081. 
61082. "Yes, Princess," said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, "it doesn't
61083. seem long ago since we first met at Bogucharovo, but how much water
61084. has flowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet
61085. I would give much to bring back that time... but there's no bringing it
61086. back."
61087. 
61088. Princess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones
61089. as he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of
61090. his words which would explain his feeling for her.
61091. 
61092. "Yes, yes," said she, "but you have no reason to regret the past, Count.
61093. As I understand your present life, I think you will always recall it
61094. with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now..."
61095. 
61096. "I cannot accept your praise," he interrupted her hurriedly. "On the
61097. contrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an
61098. interesting or cheerful subject."
61099. 
61100. His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the
61101. princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved, and it
61102. was to him that she now spoke.
61103. 
61104. "I thought you would allow me to tell you this," she said. "I had come
61105. so near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would not
61106. consider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken," and suddenly her
61107. voice trembled. "I don't know why," she continued, recovering herself,
61108. "but you used to be different, and..."
61109. 
61110. "There are a thousand reasons why," laying special emphasis on the why.
61111. "Thank you, Princess," he added softly. "Sometimes it is hard."
61112. 
61113. "So that's why! That's why!" a voice whispered in Princess Mary's soul.
61114. "No, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only that
61115. handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble, resolute,
61116. self-sacrificing spirit too," she said to herself. "Yes, he is poor now
61117. and I am rich.... Yes, that's the only reason.... Yes, were it not for
61118. that..." And remembering his former tenderness, and looking now at his
61119. kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness.
61120. 
61121. "But why, Count, why?" she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer to
61122. him. "Why? Tell me. You must tell me!"
61123. 
61124. He was silent.
61125. 
61126. "I don't understand your why, Count," she continued, "but it's hard for
61127. me... I confess it. For some reason you wish to deprive me of our former
61128. friendship. And that hurts me." There were tears in her eyes and in her
61129. voice. "I have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard
61130. for me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!" and suddenly she began to cry
61131. and was hurrying from the room.
61132. 
61133. "Princess, for God's sake!" he exclaimed, trying to stop her.
61134. "Princess!"
61135. 
61136. She turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one
61137. another's eyes--and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly
61138. became possible, inevitable, and very near.
61139. 
61140. 
61141. 
61142. 
61143. 
61144. CHAPTER VII
61145. 
61146. 
61147. In the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to Bald
61148. Hills with his wife, his mother, and Sonya.
61149. 
61150. Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without
61151. selling any of his wife's property, and having received a small
61152. inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well.
61153. 
61154. In another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he
61155. was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating
61156. to buy back Otradnoe--that being his pet dream.
61157. 
61158. Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it
61159. that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was
61160. a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones
61161. then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate
61162. management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products,
61163. and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any
61164. particular part of the work on his estate. He always had before his
61165. mind's eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it. The
61166. chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen
61167. in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important
61168. agent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made
61169. effective--the peasant laborer. When Nicholas first began farming
61170. and began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who
61171. especially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely
61172. a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At first
61173. he watched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and what they
61174. considered good and bad, and only pretended to direct them and give
61175. orders while in reality learning from them their methods, their manner
61176. of speech, and their judgment of what was good and bad. Only when he
61177. had understood the peasants' tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk
61178. their language, to grasp the hidden meaning of their words, and felt
61179. akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to
61180. perform toward them the duties demanded of him. And Nicholas' management
61181. produced very brilliant results.
61182. 
61183. Guided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the
61184. estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and
61185. delegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they
61186. had the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before
61187. analyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and
61188. credit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the
61189. peasants had and increased the number by all possible means. He kept the
61190. peasant families together in the largest groups possible, not allowing
61191. the family groups to divide into separate households. He was hard alike
61192. on the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled
61193. from the commune.
61194. 
61195. He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants' hay
61196. and corn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown
61197. and harvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did
61198. Nicholas.
61199. 
61200. He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs--the "drones"
61201. as he called them--and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity. When
61202. a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one
61203. had to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in
61204. the house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted
61205. instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He
61206. never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his
61207. every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.
61208. 
61209. He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to
61210. make things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined
61211. to do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he
61212. should or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in
61213. his own mind.
61214. 
61215. Often, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would
61216. say: "What can one do with our Russian peasants?" and imagined that he
61217. could not bear them.
61218. 
61219. Yet he loved "our Russian peasants" and their way of life with his whole
61220. soul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one
61221. way and manner of farming which produced good results.
61222. 
61223. Countess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husband's and regretted
61224. that she could not share it; but she could not understand the joys and
61225. vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote and alien. She
61226. could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy
61227. when, after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the
61228. fields or on the threshing floor, he returned from the sowing or mowing
61229. or reaping to have tea with her. She did not understand why he spoke
61230. with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and
61231. well-to-do peasant Matthew Ermishin, who with his family had carted
61232. corn all night; or of the fact that his (Nicholas') sheaves were already
61233. stacked before anyone else had his harvest in. She did not understand
61234. why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his
61235. mustache and winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall
61236. on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind
61237. carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return
61238. from the barn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of
61239. wormwood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would
61240. say: "Well, one more day and my grain and the peasants' will all be
61241. under cover."
61242. 
61243. Still less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to
61244. anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought
61245. him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her
61246. to be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately
61247. refuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her
61248. business. She felt he had a world apart, which he loved passionately and
61249. which had laws she had not fathomed.
61250. 
61251. Sometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work he
61252. was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: "Not in the least;
61253. it never entered my head and I wouldn't do that for their good! That's
61254. all poetry and old wives' talk--all that doing good to one's neighbor!
61255. What I want is that our children should not have to go begging. I must
61256. put our affairs in order while I am alive, that's all. And to do that,
61257. order and strictness are essential.... That's all about it!" said he,
61258. clenching his vigorous fist. "And fairness, of course," he added, "for
61259. if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse, he
61260. can do no good either for himself or for me."
61261. 
61262. And all Nicholas did was fruitful--probably just because he refused to
61263. allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue's
61264. sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring estates came
61265. to beg him to buy them, and long after his death the memory of his
61266. administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs. "He was a
61267. master... the peasants' affairs first and then his own. Of course he was
61268. not to be trifled with either--in a word, he was a real master!"
61269. 
61270. 
61271. 
61272. 
61273. 
61274. CHAPTER VIII
61275. 
61276. 
61277. One matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas, and
61278. that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making
61279. free use of his fists. At first he saw nothing reprehensible in
61280. this, but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of
61281. punishment suddenly changed.
61282. 
61283. Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from Bogucharovo, a
61284. man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of
61285. dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch
61286. to question him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies
61287. the sound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas
61288. went up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery
61289. frame, and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that
61290. morning. Among other things he spoke of the Bogucharovo elder. Countess
61291. Mary turned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and
61292. lips compressed and gave her husband no reply.
61293. 
61294. "Such an insolent scoundrel!" he cried, growing hot again at the mere
61295. recollection of him. "If he had told me he was drunk and did not see...
61296. But what is the matter with you, Mary?" he suddenly asked.
61297. 
61298. Countess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked
61299. down again and her lips puckered.
61300. 
61301. "Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?"
61302. 
61303. The looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in
61304. tears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow or
61305. pity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm.
61306. 
61307. The moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself
61308. and began to cry.
61309. 
61310. "Nicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!" and
61311. she covered her face with her hands.
61312. 
61313. Nicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up
61314. and down the room. He understood what she was weeping about, but could
61315. not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded
61316. from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong. "Is it just
61317. sentimentality, old wives' tales, or is she right?" he asked himself.
61318. Before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with
61319. love and pain, and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he
61320. had long been sinning against himself.
61321. 
61322. "Mary," he said softly, going up to her, "it will never happen again;
61323. I give you my word. Never," he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy
61324. asking for forgiveness.
61325. 
61326. The tears flowed faster still from the countess' eyes. She took his hand
61327. and kissed it.
61328. 
61329. "Nicholas, when did you break your cameo?" she asked to change the
61330. subject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of
61331. Laocoon's head.
61332. 
61333. "Today--it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, don't remind me of it!" and
61334. again he flushed. "I give you my word of honor it shan't occur again,
61335. and let this always be a reminder to me," and he pointed to the broken
61336. ring.
61337. 
61338. After that, when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the
61339. blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would
61340. turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the
61341. man who was making him angry. But he did forget himself once or twice
61342. within a twelvemonth, and then he would go and confess to his wife, and
61343. would again promise that this should really be the very last time.
61344. 
61345. "Mary, you must despise me!" he would say. "I deserve it."
61346. 
61347. "You should go, go away at once, if you don't feel strong enough to
61348. control yourself," she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her husband.
61349. 
61350. Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked.
61351. He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and
61352. consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid. The
61353. whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work
61354. on his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same
61355. business like seriousness--leaving home for a month, or even two, with
61356. his hunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time
61357. reading. The books he read were chiefly historical, and on these he
61358. spent a certain sum every year. He was collecting, as he said, a serious
61359. library, and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought.
61360. He would sit in his study with a grave air, reading--a task he first
61361. imposed upon himself as a duty, but which afterwards became a habit
61362. affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of
61363. being occupied with serious matters. In winter, except for business
61364. excursions, he spent most of his time at home making himself one with
61365. his family and entering into all the details of his children's relations
61366. with their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and
61367. closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her.
61368. 
61369. From the time of his marriage Sonya had lived in his house. Before
61370. that, Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and
61371. Sonya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess Mary to
61372. be gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrong he
61373. had done Sonya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined that her
61374. wealth had influenced Nicholas' choice. She could not find fault with
61375. Sonya in any way and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-will
61376. toward her which she could not overcome.
61377. 
61378. Once she had a talk with her friend Natasha about Sonya and about her
61379. own injustice toward her.
61380. 
61381. "You know," said Natasha, "you have read the Gospels a great deal--there
61382. is a passage in them that just fits Sonya."
61383. 
61384. "What?" asked Countess Mary, surprised.
61385. 
61386. "'To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be
61387. taken away.' You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I don't know.
61388. Perhaps she lacks egotism, I don't know, but from her is taken away, and
61389. everything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her.
61390. Formerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had
61391. a sort of presentiment that it would not come off. She is a sterile
61392. flower, you know--like some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry
61393. for her, and sometimes I think she doesn't feel it as you or I would."
61394. 
61395. Though Countess Mary told Natasha that those words in the Gospel must be
61396. understood differently, yet looking at Sonya she agreed with Natasha's
61397. explanation. It really seemed that Sonya did not feel her position
61398. trying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower.
61399. She seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a
61400. whole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the people but to the
61401. home. She waited on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children,
61402. was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift,
61403. and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient
61404. gratitude.
61405. 
61406. The country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the same
61407. scale as under the old prince.
61408. 
61409. The buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than
61410. simple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood,
61411. plastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with
61412. very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own
61413. serf carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was spacious
61414. and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole
61415. families of the Rostovs' and Bolkonskis' relations sometimes came to
61416. Bald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for
61417. months. Besides that, four times a year, on the name days and birthdays
61418. of the hosts, as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day
61419. or two. The rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its
61420. ordinary occupations, and its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers,
61421. provided out of the produce of the estate.
61422. 
61423. 
61424. 
61425. 
61426. 
61427. CHAPTER IX
61428. 
61429. 
61430. It was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. Natasha had
61431. been staying at her brother's with her husband and children since early
61432. autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three
61433. weeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was
61434. expected back every minute.
61435. 
61436. Besides the Bezukhov family, Nicholas' old friend the retired General
61437. Vasili Dmitrich Denisov was staying with the Rostovs this fifth of
61438. December.
61439. 
61440. On the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of
61441. visitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for
61442. a tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to
61443. the new church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to
61444. congratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the elections
61445. of the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve
61446. of that day in his usual way. He examined the bailiff's accounts of
61447. the village in Ryazan which belonged to his wife's nephew, wrote two
61448. business letters, and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and
61449. stables before dinner. Having taken precautions against the general
61450. drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint's
61451. day, he returned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk
61452. with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, at
61453. which the whole household had assembled. At that table were his mother,
61454. his mother's old lady companion Belova, his wife, their three children
61455. with their governess and tutor, his wife's nephew with his tutor, Sonya,
61456. Denisov, Natasha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael
61457. Ivanovich, the late prince's architect, who was living on in retirement
61458. at Bald Hills.
61459. 
61460. Countess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband took
61461. his place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after taking
61462. up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing
61463. before him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case when he
61464. came in to dinner straight from the farm--especially before the soup.
61465. Countess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself was in
61466. a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then
61467. began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his
61468. ill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should
61469. be angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy. She asked
61470. him where he had been. He replied. She again inquired whether
61471. everything was going well on the farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince
61472. unpleasantly and he replied hastily.
61473. 
61474. "Then I'm not mistaken," thought Countess Mary. "Why is he cross with
61475. me?" She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished
61476. to end the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but
61477. could not refrain from asking some more questions.
61478. 
61479. Thanks to Denisov the conversation at table soon became general and
61480. lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the table
61481. and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her
61482. hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her.
61483. 
61484. "You always have such strange fancies! I didn't even think of being
61485. angry," he replied.
61486. 
61487. But the word always seemed to her to imply: "Yes, I am angry but I won't
61488. tell you why."
61489. 
61490. Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even Sonya and the
61491. old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree,
61492. could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their
61493. moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they
61494. had been happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement
61495. and hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Mary's
61496. pregnancies, and this was such a time.
61497. 
61498. "Well, messieurs et mesdames," said Nicholas loudly and with apparent
61499. cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to
61500. vex her), "I have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I
61501. shall have to suffer, so today I'll go and rest."
61502. 
61503. And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and
61504. lay down on the sofa.
61505. 
61506. "That's always the way," thought Countess Mary. "He talks to everyone
61507. except me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I
61508. am in this condition." She looked down at her expanded figure and in the
61509. glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked
61510. larger than ever.
61511. 
61512. And everything annoyed her--Denisov's shouting and laughter, Natasha's
61513. talk, and especially a quick glance Sonya gave her.
61514. 
61515. Sonya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling
61516. irritated.
61517. 
61518. Having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of
61519. what they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the nursery.
61520. 
61521. The children were playing at "going to Moscow" in a carriage made of
61522. chairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with
61523. them a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable
61524. crossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with
61525. difficulty, went to the small sitting room.
61526. 
61527. "Perhaps he is not asleep; I'll have an explanation with him," she
61528. said to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother,
61529. followed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him.
61530. 
61531. "Mary, dear, I think he is asleep--he was so tired," said Sonya, meeting
61532. her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she
61533. crossed her path everywhere). "Andrew may wake him."
61534. 
61535. Countess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that
61536. Sonya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident
61537. difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but
61538. to avoid obeying Sonya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went
61539. to the door. Sonya went away by another door. From the room in which
61540. Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every
61541. slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it
61542. she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his
61543. whole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night
61544. when he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at
61545. that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: "Papa! Mamma's
61546. standing here!" Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs
61547. to the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to
61548. Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through
61549. the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and
61550. his voice said crossly:
61551. 
61552. "I can't get a moment's peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring
61553. him here?"
61554. 
61555. "I only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me..."
61556. 
61557. Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the
61558. door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little
61559. black-eyed three-year-old Natasha, her father's pet, having learned from
61560. her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran
61561. to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly
61562. opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of
61563. her sturdy little legs, and having examined the position of her father,
61564. who was asleep with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand
61565. which lay under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his
61566. face.
61567. 
61568. "Natasha, Natasha!" came Countess Mary's frightened whisper from the
61569. door. "Papa wants to sleep."
61570. 
61571. "No, Mamma, he doesn't want to sleep," said little Natasha with
61572. conviction. "He's laughing."
61573. 
61574. Nicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.
61575. 
61576. "Come in, Mary," he said to his wife.
61577. 
61578. She went in and sat down by her husband.
61579. 
61580. "I did not notice him following me," she said timidly. "I just looked
61581. in."
61582. 
61583. Holding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife and,
61584. seeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and kissed
61585. her hair.
61586. 
61587. "May I kiss Mamma?" he asked Natasha.
61588. 
61589. Natasha smiled bashfully.
61590. 
61591. "Again!" she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot
61592. where Nicholas had placed the kiss.
61593. 
61594. "I don't know why you think I am cross," said Nicholas, replying to the
61595. question he knew was in his wife's mind.
61596. 
61597. "You have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are like
61598. that. It always seems to me..."
61599. 
61600. "Mary, don't talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!" he
61601. said gaily.
61602. 
61603. "It seems to be that you can't love me, that I am so plain... always...
61604. and now... in this cond..."
61605. 
61606. "Oh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, it's love that
61607. makes us see beauty. It is only Malvinas and women of that kind who are
61608. loved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I don't love her, but...
61609. I don't know how to put it. Without you, or when something comes between
61610. us like this, I seem lost and can't do anything. Now do I love my
61611. finger? I don't love it, but just try to cut it off!"
61612. 
61613. "I'm not like that myself, but I understand. So you're not angry with
61614. me?"
61615. 
61616. "Awfully angry!" he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing his hair
61617. he began to pace the room.
61618. 
61619. "Do you know, Mary, what I've been thinking?" he began, immediately
61620. thinking aloud in his wife's presence now that they had made it up.
61621. 
61622. He did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A
61623. thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he told
61624. her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.
61625. 
61626. Countess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and in
61627. her turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the children.
61628. 
61629. "You can see the woman in her already," she said in French, pointing to
61630. little Natasha. "You reproach us women with being illogical. Here is our
61631. logic. I say: 'Papa wants to sleep!' but she says, 'No, he's laughing.'
61632. And she was right," said Countess Mary with a happy smile.
61633. 
61634. "Yes, yes." And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong hand,
61635. lifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the legs, and
61636. paced the room with her. There was an expression of carefree happiness
61637. on the faces of both father and daughter.
61638. 
61639. "But you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one," his wife
61640. whispered in French.
61641. 
61642. "Yes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show..."
61643. 
61644. At that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in
61645. the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.
61646. 
61647. "Somebody has come."
61648. 
61649. "I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see," said Countess Mary and left
61650. the room.
61651. 
61652. In her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a
61653. gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing child quickly
61654. from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. His capers reminded
61655. him of dancing, and looking at the child's round happy little face he
61656. thought of what she would be like when he was an old man, taking her
61657. into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had
61658. danced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.
61659. 
61660. "It is he, it is he, Nicholas!" said Countess Mary, re-entering the room
61661. a few minutes later. "Now our Natasha has come to life. You should have
61662. seen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long.
61663. Well, come along now, quick, quick! It's time you two were parted," she
61664. added, looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.
61665. 
61666. Nicholas went out holding the child by the hand.
61667. 
61668. Countess Mary remained in the sitting room.
61669. 
61670. "I should never, never have believed that one could be so happy," she
61671. whispered to herself. A smile lit up her face but at the same time she
61672. sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she
61673. felt, through her happiness, that there is another sort of happiness
61674. unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that
61675. instant.
61676. 
61677. 
61678. 
61679. 
61680. 
61681. CHAPTER X
61682. 
61683. 
61684. Natasha had married in the early spring of 1813, and in 1820 already had
61685. three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was
61686. now nursing. She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was difficult
61687. to recognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively Natasha of
61688. former days. Her features were more defined and had a calm, soft,
61689. and serene expression. In her face there was none of the ever-glowing
61690. animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm.
61691. Now her face and body were often all that one saw, and her soul was
61692. not visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong, handsome, and
61693. fertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now. That
61694. happened only when, as was the case that day, her husband returned home,
61695. or a sick child was convalescent, or when she and Countess Mary spoke of
61696. Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to her husband, who she imagined
61697. was jealous of Prince Andrew's memory), or on the rare occasions when
61698. something happened to induce her to sing, a practice she had quite
61699. abandoned since her marriage. At the rare moments when the old fire
61700. did kindle in her handsome, fully developed body she was even more
61701. attractive than in former days.
61702. 
61703. Since their marriage Natasha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in
61704. Petersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to
61705. say, in Nicholas' house. The young Countess Bezukhova was not often seen
61706. in society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her
61707. and found her neither attractive nor amiable. Not that Natasha liked
61708. solitude--she did not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought
61709. that she did not--but with her pregnancies, her confinements, the
61710. nursing of her children, and sharing every moment of her husband's life,
61711. she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing
61712. society. All who had known Natasha before her marriage wondered at the
61713. change in her as at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with
61714. her maternal instinct had realized that all Natasha's outbursts had
61715. been due to her need of children and a husband--as she herself had once
61716. exclaimed at Otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest--and her mother
61717. was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never
61718. understood Natasha, and she kept saying that she had always known that
61719. Natasha would make an exemplary wife and mother.
61720. 
61721. "Only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all
61722. bounds," said the countess, "so that it even becomes absurd."
61723. 
61724. Natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,
61725. especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself
61726. go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be
61727. even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and
61728. should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her
61729. husband. Natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery,
61730. of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up
61731. just because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with
61732. her manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show
61733. herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid
61734. inconveniencing him by being too exacting. She acted in contradiction
61735. to all those rules. She felt that the allurements instinct had formerly
61736. taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of
61737. her husband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up
61738. entirely--that is, with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden
61739. from him. She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained
61740. by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but by something
61741. else--indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul.
61742. 
61743. To fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic
61744. songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn
61745. herself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps
61746. have been agreeable--she did not know--but she had no time at all for
61747. it. The chief reason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress,
61748. or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for
61749. these things.
61750. 
61751. We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in
61752. a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so
61753. trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one's entire
61754. attention is devoted to it.
61755. 
61756. The subject which wholly engrossed Natasha's attention was her family:
61757. that is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong
61758. entirely to her and to the home, and the children whom she had to bear,
61759. bring into the world, nurse, and bring up.
61760. 
61761. And the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole
61762. soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger
61763. did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers
61764. appear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet
61765. was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.
61766. 
61767. There were then as now conversations and discussions about women's
61768. rights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights,
61769. though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now; but
61770. these topics were not merely uninteresting to Natasha, she positively
61771. did not understand them.
61772. 
61773. These questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing in
61774. marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that is,
61775. only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance, which
61776. lies in the family.
61777. 
61778. Discussions and questions of that kind, which are like the question of
61779. how to get the greatest gratification from one's dinner, did not then
61780. and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the
61781. nourishment it affords; and the purpose of marriage is the family.
61782. 
61783. If the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats two
61784. dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his
61785. purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.
61786. 
61787. If the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to have
61788. many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in that
61789. case will not have a family.
61790. 
61791. If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the
61792. family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one
61793. can digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for
61794. the family--that is, one wife or one husband. Natasha needed a husband.
61795. A husband was given her and he gave her a family. And she not only saw
61796. no need of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her
61797. soul were intent on serving that husband and family, she could not
61798. imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were
61799. different.
61800. 
61801. Natasha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the
61802. society of her relatives--Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother,
61803. and Sonya. She valued the company of those to whom she could come
61804. striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and with
61805. joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby's napkin, and
61806. from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was
61807. much better.
61808. 
61809. To such an extent had Natasha let herself go that the way she dressed
61810. and did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy--she was
61811. jealous of Sonya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or
61812. plain--were habitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general
61813. opinion was that Pierre was under his wife's thumb, which was really
61814. true. From the very first days of their married life Natasha had
61815. announced her demands. Pierre was greatly surprised by his wife's view,
61816. to him a perfectly novel one, that every moment of his life belonged to
61817. her and to the family. His wife's demands astonished him, but they also
61818. flattered him, and he submitted to them.
61819. 
61820. Pierre's subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not
61821. flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did
61822. not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a
61823. whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on
61824. business--in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which
61825. she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great
61826. importance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the right to
61827. regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose. At
61828. home Natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband,
61829. and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied--that is,
61830. was reading or writing in his study. Pierre had but to show a partiality
61831. for anything to get just what he liked done always. He had only to
61832. express a wish and Natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it.
61833. 
61834. The entire household was governed according to Pierre's supposed orders,
61835. that is, by his wishes which Natasha tried to guess. Their way of
61836. life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Natasha's
61837. occupations, the children's upbringing, were all selected not merely
61838. with regard to Pierre's expressed wishes, but to what Natasha from the
61839. thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she
61840. deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once
61841. arrived at them clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to
61842. change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons.
61843. 
61844. Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their
61845. first child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet nurse
61846. three times and Natasha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her
61847. of Rousseau's view, with which he quite agreed, that to have a wet
61848. nurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite
61849. the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband
61850. himself--who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby
61851. herself, a thing then unheard of and considered injurious--she insisted
61852. on having her own way, and after that nursed all her babies herself.
61853. 
61854. It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife
61855. would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and
61856. delight would find in his wife's ideas and actions the very thought
61857. against which she had argued, but divested of everything superfluous
61858. that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his
61859. opinion.
61860. 
61861. After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm
61862. consciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw
61863. himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within himself
61864. inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really good in
61865. him was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected.
61866. And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and
61867. mysterious reflection.
61868. 
61869. 
61870. 
61871. 
61872. 
61873. CHAPTER XI
61874. 
61875. 
61876. Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the Rostovs
61877. he had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come
61878. to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being
61879. discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal
61880. founders.
61881. 
61882. On reading that letter (she always read her husband's letters) Natasha
61883. herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel
61884. his absence very acutely. She attributed immense importance to all
61885. her husband's intellectual and abstract interests though she did not
61886. understand them, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such
61887. matters. To Pierre's timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she
61888. replied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return.
61889. He was given four weeks' leave of absence.
61890. 
61891. Ever since that leave of absence had expired, more than a fortnight
61892. before, Natasha had been in a constant state of alarm, depression, and
61893. irritability.
61894. 
61895. Denisov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with
61896. the present state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He
61897. looked at Natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a
61898. person once dear. A dull, dejected look, random replies, and talk about
61899. the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress.
61900. 
61901. Natasha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her mother,
61902. her brother, Sonya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her
61903. tried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning.
61904. 
61905. "It's all nonsense, all rubbish--those discussions which lead to nothing
61906. and all those idiotic societies!" Natasha declared of the very affairs
61907. in the immense importance of which she firmly believed.
61908. 
61909. And she would go to the nursery to nurse Petya, her only boy. No one
61910. else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this
61911. little three-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she was
61912. conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little
61913. nose. That creature said: "You are angry, you are jealous, you would
61914. like to pay him out, you are afraid--but here am I! And I am he..." and
61915. that was unanswerable. It was more than true.
61916. 
61917. During that fortnight of anxiety Natasha resorted to the baby for
61918. comfort so often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him and
61919. he fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, and yet that was just
61920. what she needed. While attending to him she bore the anxiety about her
61921. husband more easily.
61922. 
61923. She was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre's sleigh was heard
61924. at the front door, and the old nurse--knowing how to please her
61925. mistress--entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming
61926. face.
61927. 
61928. "Has he come?" Natasha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest
61929. she should rouse the dozing baby.
61930. 
61931. "He's come, ma'am," whispered the nurse.
61932. 
61933. The blood rushed to Natasha's face and her feet involuntarily moved, but
61934. she could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his eyes and
61935. looked at her. "You're here?" he seemed to be saying, and again lazily
61936. smacked his lips.
61937. 
61938. Cautiously withdrawing her breast, Natasha rocked him a little, handed
61939. him to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door. But at the
61940. door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in
61941. her joy left the child too soon, and she glanced round. The nurse with
61942. raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot.
61943. 
61944. "Go, ma'am! Don't worry, go!" she whispered, smiling, with the kind of
61945. familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.
61946. 
61947. Natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.
61948. 
61949. Denisov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his
61950. pipe, now for the first time recognized the old Natasha. A flood of
61951. brilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.
61952. 
61953. "He's come!" she exclaimed as she ran past, and Denisov felt that he too
61954. was delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had returned.
61955. 
61956. On reaching the vestibule Natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat
61957. unwinding his scarf. "It's he! It's really he! He has come!" she said
61958. to herself, and rushing at him embraced him, pressed his head to her
61959. breast, and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy, happy face,
61960. covered with hoarfrost. "Yes, it is he, happy and contented..."
61961. 
61962. Then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had
61963. experienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her
61964. face vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of
61965. reproaches and angry words.
61966. 
61967. "Yes, it's all very well for you. You are pleased, you've had a good
61968. time.... But what about me? You might at least have shown consideration
61969. for the children. I am nursing and my milk was spoiled.... Petya was at
61970. death's door. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, enjoying..."
61971. 
61972. Pierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come sooner; he
61973. knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two;
61974. above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy. He wanted
61975. to smile but dared not even think of doing so. He made a piteous,
61976. frightened face and bent down.
61977. 
61978. "I could not, on my honor. But how is Petya?"
61979. 
61980. "All right now. Come along! I wonder you're not ashamed! If only you
61981. could see what I was like without you, how I suffered!"
61982. 
61983. "You are well?"
61984. 
61985. "Come, come!" she said, not letting go of his arm. And they went to
61986. their rooms.
61987. 
61988. When Nicholas and his wife came to look for Pierre he was in the nursery
61989. holding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge right palm and
61990. dandling him. A blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby's broad face
61991. with its toothless open mouth. The storm was long since over and there
61992. was bright, joyous sunshine on Natasha's face as she gazed tenderly at
61993. her husband and child.
61994. 
61995. "And have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?" she
61996. asked.
61997. 
61998. "Yes, capitally."
61999. 
62000. "You see, he holds it up." (She meant the baby's head.) "But how he did
62001. frighten me... You've seen the princess? Is it true she's in love with
62002. that..."
62003. 
62004. "Yes, just fancy..."
62005. 
62006. At that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in. Pierre with the baby
62007. on his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries. But
62008. in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the baby
62009. with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his
62010. attention.
62011. 
62012. "How sweet!" said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the baby.
62013. "Now, Nicholas," she added, turning to her husband, "I can't understand
62014. how it is you don't see the charm of these delicious marvels."
62015. 
62016. "I don't and can't," replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby. "A
62017. lump of flesh. Come along, Pierre!"
62018. 
62019. "And yet he's such an affectionate father," said Countess Mary,
62020. vindicating her husband, "but only after they are a year old or so..."
62021. 
62022. "Now, Pierre nurses them splendidly," said Natasha. "He says his hand is
62023. just made for a baby's seat. Just look!"
62024. 
62025. "Only not for this..." Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and
62026. shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse.
62027. 
62028. 
62029. 
62030. 
62031. 
62032. CHAPTER XII
62033. 
62034. 
62035. As in every large household, there were at Bald Hills several perfectly
62036. distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole, though each
62037. retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others. Every
62038. event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all
62039. these worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve
62040. over that occurrence independently of the others.
62041. 
62042. For instance, Pierre's return was a joyful and important event and they
62043. all felt it to be so.
62044. 
62045. The servants--the most reliable judges of their masters because they
62046. judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their
62047. acts and way of life--were glad of Pierre's return because they knew
62048. that when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to
62049. attend to the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and
62050. also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays.
62051. 
62052. The children and their governesses were glad of Pierre's return because
62053. no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did.
62054. He alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise (his only piece)
62055. to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt
62056. sure he had brought presents for them all.
62057. 
62058. Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent,
62059. with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because
62060. Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and
62061. passionate affection. No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre
62062. whom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had brought him up
62063. had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and
62064. little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of
62065. contempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or
62066. a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned,
62067. wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre's presence his face always shone
62068. with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to
62069. him. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards,
62070. with Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of
62071. everything Pierre had said. Pierre's past life and his unhappiness prior
62072. to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from
62073. some words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity,
62074. Platon Karataev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Natasha
62075. (of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierre's
62076. friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not remember--all this
62077. made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint.
62078. 
62079. From broken remarks about Natasha and his father, from the emotion with
62080. which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent
62081. tenderness with which Natasha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just
62082. beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had
62083. loved Natasha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father
62084. whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not
62085. be pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and
62086. tears of sadness and rapture. So the boy also was happy that Pierre had
62087. arrived.
62088. 
62089. The guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite
62090. any company he was in.
62091. 
62092. The grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were
62093. pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly
62094. and peacefully.
62095. 
62096. The old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and
62097. especially that Natasha would now be herself again.
62098. 
62099. Pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made
62100. haste to satisfy all their expectations.
62101. 
62102. Though the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the aid
62103. of a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not forgetting
62104. his mother--and brother-in-law's commissions, nor the dress material for
62105. a present to Belova, nor toys for his wife's nephews. In the early days
62106. of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect
62107. him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy, and he
62108. had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he
62109. forgot everything. But in time he grew used to this demand. Knowing that
62110. Natasha asked nothing for herself, and gave him commissions for others
62111. only when he himself had offered to undertake them, he now found an
62112. unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for
62113. everyone in the house, and never forgot anything. If he now incurred
62114. Natasha's censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive
62115. things. To her other defects (as most people thought them, but which
62116. to Pierre were qualities) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now
62117. added stinginess.
62118. 
62119. From the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing
62120. entailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he
62121. spent only half as much as before, and that his affairs--which had been
62122. in disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wife's debts--had
62123. begun to improve.
62124. 
62125. Life was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive
62126. luxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no
62127. longer his nor did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had now
62128. been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in
62129. his power, and so that way of life proved economical.
62130. 
62131. With a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.
62132. 
62133. "What do you think of this?" said he, unrolling a piece of stuff like a
62134. shopman.
62135. 
62136. Natasha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her
62137. lap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he
62138. showed her.
62139. 
62140. "That's for Belova? Excellent!" She felt the quality of the material.
62141. "It was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?"
62142. 
62143. Pierre told her the price.
62144. 
62145. "Too dear!" Natasha remarked. "How pleased the children will be and
62146. Mamma too! Only you need not have bought me this," she added, unable to
62147. suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls,
62148. of a kind then just coming into fashion.
62149. 
62150. "Adele tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it," returned Pierre.
62151. 
62152. "When am I to wear it?" and Natasha stuck it in her coil of hair. "When
62153. I take little Masha into society? Perhaps they will be fashionable again
62154. by then. Well, let's go now."
62155. 
62156. And collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to
62157. the old countess' rooms.
62158. 
62159. The countess was sitting with her companion Belova, playing
62160. grand-patience as usual, when Pierre and Natasha came into the drawing
62161. room with parcels under their arms.
62162. 
62163. The countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a
62164. frill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper lip
62165. had sunk in, and her eyes were dim.
62166. 
62167. After the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession, she
62168. felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left
62169. without aim or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept
62170. awake, but did not live. Life gave her no new impressions. She wanted
62171. nothing from life but tranquillity, and that tranquillity only death
62172. could give her. But until death came she had to go on living, that is,
62173. to use her vital forces. A peculiarity one sees in very young children
62174. and very old people was particularly evident in her. Her life had
62175. no external aims--only a need to exercise her various functions and
62176. inclinations was apparent. She had to eat, sleep, think, speak, weep,
62177. work, give vent to her anger, and so on, merely because she had a
62178. stomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and a liver. She did these things not
62179. under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do,
62180. when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their
62181. functions remains unnoticed. She talked only because she physically
62182. needed to exercise her tongue and lungs. She cried as a child does,
62183. because her nose had to be cleared, and so on. What for people in their
62184. full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext.
62185. 
62186. Thus in the morning--especially if she had eaten anything rich the day
62187. before--she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest
62188. pretext Belova's deafness.
62189. 
62190. She would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end
62191. of the room.
62192. 
62193. "It seems a little warmer today, my dear," she would murmur.
62194. 
62195. And when Belova replied: "Oh yes, they've come," she would mutter
62196. angrily: "O Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!"
62197. 
62198. Another pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too damp
62199. or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability her face
62200. would grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when Belova
62201. would again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the countess' face yellow. Just
62202. as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise
62203. her still-existing faculty of thinking--and the pretext for that was a
62204. game of patience. When she needed to cry, the deceased count would be
62205. the pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health
62206. would be the pretext, and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the
62207. pretext would be Countess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise,
62208. which was usually toward seven o'clock when she had had an after-dinner
62209. rest in a darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same
62210. stories over and over again to the same audience.
62211. 
62212. The old lady's condition was understood by the whole household though no
62213. one ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible effort to satisfy
62214. her needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile
62215. between Nicholas, Pierre, Natasha, and Countess Mary was the common
62216. understanding of her condition expressed.
62217. 
62218. But those glances expressed something more: they said that she had
62219. played her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole self,
62220. that we must all become like her, and that they were glad to yield to
62221. her, to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as
62222. full of life as themselves, but now so much to be pitied. "Memento
62223. mori," said these glances.
62224. 
62225. Only the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and the
62226. little children failed to understand this and avoided her.
62227. 
62228. 
62229. 
62230. 
62231. 
62232. CHAPTER XIII
62233. 
62234. 
62235. When Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in
62236. one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of
62237. playing patience, and so--though by force of habit she greeted him
62238. with the words she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an
62239. absence: "High time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of waiting
62240. for you. Well, thank God!" and received her presents with another
62241. customary remark: "It's not the gift that's precious, my dear, but that
62242. you give it to me, an old woman..."--yet it was evident that she was
62243. not pleased by Pierre's arrival at that moment when it diverted her
62244. attention from the unfinished game.
62245. 
62246. She finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents.
62247. They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a
62248. bright-blue Sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with
62249. a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the count's portrait on the lid which
62250. Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. The countess had
62251. long wished for such a box, but as she did not want to cry just then she
62252. glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to
62253. the box for cards.
62254. 
62255. "Thank you, my dear, you have cheered me up," said she as she always
62256. did. "But best of all you have brought yourself back--for I never saw
62257. anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are we
62258. to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away. Doesn't see
62259. anything, doesn't remember anything," she went on, repeating her usual
62260. phrases. "Look, Anna Timofeevna," she added to her companion, "see what
62261. a box for cards my son has brought us!"
62262. 
62263. Belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material.
62264. 
62265. Though Pierre, Natasha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Denisov had much to
62266. talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess--not
62267. that anything was hidden from her, but because she had dropped so
62268. far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her
62269. presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to
62270. repeat what they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was
62271. dead and so-and-so was married, which she would again be unable to
62272. remember--yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from
62273. habit, and Pierre answered the countess' questions as to whether Prince
62274. Vasili had aged and whether Countess Mary Alexeevna had sent greetings
62275. and still thought of them, and other matters that interested no one and
62276. to which she herself was indifferent.
62277. 
62278. Conversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable,
62279. continued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the family
62280. were assembled near the round tea table at which Sonya presided beside
62281. the samovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had had
62282. tea and their voices were audible from the next room. At tea all sat
62283. in their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table
62284. where his tea was handed to him; Milka, the old gray borzoi bitch
62285. (daughter of the first Milka), with a quite gray face and large black
62286. eyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside
62287. him; Denisov, whose curly hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half
62288. gray, sat beside countess Mary with his general's tunic unbuttoned;
62289. Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess. He spoke of what he
62290. knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand. He
62291. told her of external social events and of the people who had formed
62292. the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real, living, and
62293. distinct group, but who were now for the most part scattered about the
62294. world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they
62295. had sown in earlier years. But to the old countess those contemporaries
62296. of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society. Natasha saw by
62297. Pierre's animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had
62298. much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess. Denisov,
62299. not being a member of the family, did not understand Pierre's caution
62300. and being, as a malcontent, much interested in what was occurring in
62301. Petersburg, kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in
62302. the Semenovsk regiment, then about Arakcheev, and then about the Bible
62303. Society. Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of
62304. these things, but Nicholas and Natasha always brought him back to the
62305. health of Prince Ivan and Countess Mary Alexeevna.
62306. 
62307. "Well, and all this idiocy--Gossner and Tatawinova?" Denisov asked. "Is
62308. that weally still going on?"
62309. 
62310. "Going on?" Pierre exclaimed. "Why more than ever! The Bible Society is
62311. the whole government now!"
62312. 
62313.  "What is that, mon cher ami?" asked the countess, who had
62314. finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry
62315. after her meal. "What are you saying about the government? I don't
62316. understand."
62317. 
62318. "Well, you know, Maman," Nicholas interposed, knowing how to translate
62319. things into his mother's language, "Prince Alexander Golitsyn has
62320. founded a society and in consequence has great influence, they say."
62321. 
62322. "Arakcheev and Golitsyn," incautiously remarked Pierre, "are now the
62323. whole government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere and
62324. are afraid of everything."
62325. 
62326. "Well, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most estimable
62327. man. I used to meet him at Mary Antonovna's," said the countess in an
62328. offended tone; and still more offended that they all remained silent,
62329. she went on: "Nowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel Society! Well, and
62330. what harm is there in that?" and she rose (everybody else got up too)
62331. and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting
62332. room.
62333. 
62334. The melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the
62335. children's voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some jolly
62336. excitement was going on there.
62337. 
62338. "Finished, finished!" little Natasha's gleeful yell rose above them all.
62339. 
62340. Pierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Natasha he
62341. never lost sight of) and smiled happily.
62342. 
62343. "That's delightful music!" said he.
62344. 
62345. "It means that Anna Makarovna has finished her stocking," said Countess
62346. Mary.
62347. 
62348. "Oh, I'll go and see," said Pierre, jumping up. "You know," he added,
62349. stopping at the door, "why I'm especially fond of that music? It is
62350. always the first thing that tells me all is well. When I was driving
62351. here today, the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I
62352. entered the anteroom I heard Andrusha's peals of laughter and that meant
62353. that all was well."
62354. 
62355. "I know! I know that feeling," said Nicholas. "But I mustn't go
62356. there--those stockings are to be a surprise for me."
62357. 
62358. Pierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew still
62359. louder.
62360. 
62361. "Come, Anna Makarovna," Pierre's voice was heard saying, "come here into
62362. the middle of the room and at the word of command, 'One, two,' and when
62363. I say 'three'... You stand here, and you in my arms--well now! One,
62364. two!..." said Pierre, and a silence followed: "three!" and a rapturously
62365. breathless cry of children's voices filled the room. "Two, two!" they
62366. shouted.
62367. 
62368. This meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to
62369. herself Anna Makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same
62370. needles, and which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly drew,
62371. one out of the other, in the children's presence.
62372. 
62373. 
62374. 
62375. 
62376. 
62377. CHAPTER XIV
62378. 
62379. 
62380. Soon after this the children came in to say good night. They kissed
62381. everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out.
62382. Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles whispered to the
62383. boy to come downstairs.
62384. 
62385. "No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay," replied
62386. Nicholas Bolkonski also in a whisper.
62387. 
62388. "Ma tante, please let me stay," said he, going up to his aunt.
62389. 
62390. His face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary
62391. glanced at him and turned to Pierre.
62392. 
62393. "When you are here he can't tear himself away," she said.
62394. 
62395. "I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good night!"
62396. said Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to young
62397. Nicholas with a smile. "You and I haven't seen anything of one another
62398. yet... How like he is growing, Mary!" he added, addressing Countess
62399. Mary.
62400. 
62401. "Like my father?" asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up at
62402. Pierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.
62403. 
62404. Pierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the
62405. children had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork; Natasha
62406. did not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and Denisov rose, asked
62407. for their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from Sonya--who
62408. sat weary but resolute at the samovar--and questioned Pierre. The
62409. curly-headed, delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner,
62410. starting every now and then and muttering something to himself, and
62411. evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly
62412. head, with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, toward the
62413. place where Pierre sat.
62414. 
62415. The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power,
62416. in which most people see the chief interest of home politics. Denisov,
62417. dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments
62418. in the service, heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg
62419. which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp comments on what
62420. Pierre told them.
62421. 
62422. "One used to have to be a German--now one must dance with Tatawinova
62423. and Madame Kwudener, and wead Ecka'tshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they
62424. should let that fine fellow Bonaparte lose--he'd knock all this nonsense
62425. out of them! Fancy giving the command of the Semenov wegiment to a
62426. fellow like that Schwa'tz!" he cried.
62427. 
62428. Nicholas, though free from Denisov's readiness to find fault with
62429. everything, also thought that discussion of the government was a very
62430. serious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had been appointed
62431. Minister of This and B Governor General of That, and that the Emperor
62432. had said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed to him very
62433. important. And so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these
62434. things and to question Pierre. The questions put by these two kept the
62435. conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the
62436. higher government circles.
62437. 
62438. But Natasha, knowing all her husband's ways and ideas, saw that he had
62439. long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to
62440. another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of
62441. which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince
62442. Theodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with Prince
62443. Theodore had gone.
62444. 
62445. "What was it about?" asked Nicholas.
62446. 
62447. "Always the same thing," said Pierre, looking round at his listeners.
62448. "Everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be
62449. allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to
62450. counteract it as far as they can."
62451. 
62452. "What can decent men do?" Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. "What
62453. can be done?"
62454. 
62455. "Why, this..."
62456. 
62457. "Come into my study," said Nicholas.
62458. 
62459. Natasha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now
62460. heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary
62461. followed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas Bolkonski
62462. followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table
62463. in a shady corner by the window.
62464. 
62465. "Well, what would you do?" asked Denisov.
62466. 
62467. "Always some fantastic schemes," said Nicholas.
62468. 
62469. "Why this," began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,
62470. sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: "the position
62471. in Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He
62472. has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism" (Pierre could not
62473. tolerate mysticism in anyone now). "He seeks only for peace, and only
62474. these people sans foi ni loi * can give it him--people who recklessly
62475. hack at and strangle everything--Magnitski, Arakcheev, and tutti
62476. quanti.... You will agree that if you did not look after your estates
62477. yourself but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher your steward was the
62478. more readily your object might be attained," he said to Nicholas.
62479. 
62480. 
62481.     * Without faith or law.
62482. 
62483. 
62484. "Well, what does that lead up to?" said Nicholas.
62485. 
62486. "Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in the
62487. army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the
62488. people are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and
62489. honest is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Everything is
62490. strained to such a degree that it will certainly break," said Pierre (as
62491. those who examine the actions of any government have always said since
62492. governments began). "I told them just one thing in Petersburg."
62493. 
62494. "Told whom?"
62495. 
62496. "Well, you know whom," said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under
62497. his brows. "Prince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and
62498. philanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in the
62499. present circumstances something else is needed."
62500. 
62501. At that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face
62502. darkened and he went up to the boy.
62503. 
62504. "Why are you here?"
62505. 
62506. "Why? Let him be," said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and
62507. continuing. "That is not enough, I told them. Something else is needed.
62508. When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment,
62509. when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as
62510. possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general
62511. calamity. Everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and
62512. depraved. One is lured by women, another by honors, a third by ambition
62513. or money, and they go over to that camp. No independent men, such as you
62514. or I, are left. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let the
62515. mot d'ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well!"
62516. 
62517. Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat
62518. down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning
62519. more and more.
62520. 
62521. "But action with what aim?" he cried. "And what position will you adopt
62522. toward the government?"
62523. 
62524. "Why, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the
62525. government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but it
62526. is a society of true conservatives--a society of gentlemen in the full
62527. meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some Pugachev or other from
62528. killing my children and yours, and Arakcheev from sending me off to some
62529. Military Settlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and the
62530. general safety."
62531. 
62532. "Yes, but it's a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one
62533. which can only cause harm."
62534. 
62535. "Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe" (they did not then venture
62536. to suggest that Russia had saved Europe) "do any harm? The Tugendbund
62537. is an alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what Christ
62538. preached on the Cross."
62539. 
62540. Natasha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at her
62541. husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased her--that did not
62542. even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple
62543. and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she
62544. knew that it sprang from Pierre's whole soul), but it was his animated
62545. and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.
62546. 
62547. The boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down
62548. collar--whom everyone had forgotten--gazed at Pierre with even greater
62549. and more rapturous joy. Every word of Pierre's burned into his heart,
62550. and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the
62551. sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle's table.
62552. 
62553. "It is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German
62554. Tugendbund was, and what I am proposing."
62555. 
62556. "No, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters,
62557. but I don't understand it and can't even pwonounce it," interposed
62558. Denisov in a loud and resolute voice. "I agwee that evewything here is
62559. wotten and howwible, but the Tugendbund I don't understand. If we're
62560. not satisfied, let us have a bunt of our own. That's all wight. Je suis
62561. vot'e homme!" *
62562. 
62563. 
62564.     * "I'm your man."
62565. 
62566. 
62567. Pierre smiled, Natasha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his brows
62568. still more and began proving to Pierre that there was no prospect of
62569. any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his
62570. imagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties
62571. were greater and more resourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This
62572. made him still angrier, for he was fully convinced, not by reasoning
62573. but by something within him stronger than reason, of the justice of his
62574. opinion.
62575. 
62576. "I will tell you this," he said, rising and trying with nervously
62577. twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally
62578. abandoning the attempt. "I can't prove it to you. You say that
62579. everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I don't
62580. see it. But you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional
62581. matter, and to that I reply: 'You are my best friend, as you know,
62582. but if you formed a secret society and began working against the
62583. government--be it what it may--I know it is my duty to obey the
62584. government. And if Arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you
62585. and cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.'
62586. And you may argue about that as you like!"
62587. 
62588. An awkward silence followed these words. Natasha was the first to speak,
62589. defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense was weak
62590. and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was resumed, and
62591. no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholas' last remark.
62592. 
62593. When they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolkonski went
62594. up to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.
62595. 
62596. "Uncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would he agree with
62597. you?" he asked.
62598. 
62599. And Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, complex, and
62600. powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in
62601. this boy during that conversation, and remembering all he had said he
62602. regretted that the lad should have heard him. He had, however, to give
62603. him an answer.
62604. 
62605. "Yes, I think so," he said reluctantly, and left the study.
62606. 
62607. The lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he
62608. had done to the things on the table. He flushed and went up to Nicholas.
62609. 
62610. "Uncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally," he said, pointing to
62611. the broken sealing wax and pens.
62612. 
62613. Nicholas started angrily.
62614. 
62615. "All right, all right," he said, throwing the bits under the table.
62616. 
62617. And evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned away
62618. from the boy.
62619. 
62620. "You ought not to have been here at all," he said.
62621. 
62622. 
62623. 
62624. 
62625. 
62626. CHAPTER XV
62627. 
62628. 
62629. The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies, but
62630. turned on the subject Nicholas liked best--recollections of 1812.
62631. Denisov started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing
62632. about them. The family separated on the most friendly terms.
62633. 
62634. After supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given
62635. instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went to the
62636. bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still at her
62637. table, writing.
62638. 
62639. "What are you writing, Mary?" Nicholas asked.
62640. 
62641. Countess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing would
62642. not be understood or approved by her husband.
62643. 
62644. She had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at the same
62645. time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to
62646. tell him.
62647. 
62648. "A diary, Nicholas," she replied, handing him a blue exercise book
62649. filled with her firm, bold writing.
62650. 
62651. "A diary?" Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up the
62652. book.
62653. 
62654. It was in French.
62655. 
62656. 
62657. December 4. Today when Andrusha (her eldest boy) woke up he did not
62658. wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He was naughty and
62659. obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier. Then I took the
62660. matter in hand: I left him alone and began with nurse's help to get the
62661. other children up, telling him that I did not love him. For a long time
62662. he was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in
62663. his shirt, and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time.
62664. It was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me.
62665. Afterwards in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began
62666. crying piteously and kissing me. One can do anything with him by
62667. tenderness.
62668. 
62669. 
62670. "What is a 'ticket'?" Nicholas inquired.
62671. 
62672. "I have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how
62673. they have behaved."
62674. 
62675. Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and
62676. continued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down
62677. everything in the children's lives that seemed noteworthy to their
62678. mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections
62679. on educational methods. They were for the most part quite insignificant
62680. trifles, but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either, now
62681. that he read this diary about his children for the first time.
62682. 
62683. Under the date "5" was entered:
62684. 
62685. 
62686. Mitya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding. He had
62687. none, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were
62688. eating! I think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only
62689. develops their greediness. Must tell Nicholas this.
62690. 
62691. 
62692. Nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant eyes
62693. gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her
62694. diary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his
62695. admiration for his wife.
62696. 
62697. Perhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or even
62698. done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of which the
62699. sole aim was the children's moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas
62700. been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady,
62701. tender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at
62702. her spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his reach,
62703. in which she had her being.
62704. 
62705. He was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own
62706. insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the
62707. more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of
62708. himself.
62709. 
62710. "I quite, quite approve, my dearest!" said he with a significant look,
62711. and after a short pause he added: "And I behaved badly today. You
62712. weren't in the study. We began disputing--Pierre and I--and I lost my
62713. temper. But he is impossible: such a child! I don't know what would
62714. become of him if Natasha didn't keep him in hand.... Have you any idea
62715. why he went to Petersburg? They have formed..."
62716. 
62717. "Yes, I know," said Countess Mary. "Natasha told me."
62718. 
62719. "Well, then, you know," Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere
62720. recollection of their discussion, "he wanted to convince me that it is
62721. every honest man's duty to go against the government, and that the oath
62722. of allegiance and duty... I am sorry you weren't there. They all fell
62723. on me--Denisov and Natasha... Natasha is absurd. How she rules over him!
62724. And yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her
62725. own but only repeats his sayings..." added Nicholas, yielding to that
62726. irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and
62727. dearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying about Natasha could
62728. have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife.
62729. 
62730. "Yes, I have noticed that," said Countess Mary.
62731. 
62732. "When I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he
62733. started proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there--what
62734. would you have said?"
62735. 
62736. "As I see it you were quite right, and I told Natasha so. Pierre says
62737. everybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, and that it
62738. is our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is right there," said
62739. Countess Mary, "but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us,
62740. duties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might expose
62741. ourselves to risks we must not risk our children."
62742. 
62743. "Yes, that's it! That's just what I said to him," put in Nicholas, who
62744. fancied he really had said it. "But they insisted on their own view:
62745. love of one's neighbor and Christianity--and all this in the presence of
62746. young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things."
62747. 
62748. "Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas,"
62749. said Countess Mary. "He is such an exceptional boy. I am afraid I
62750. neglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while
62751. he has no one. He is constantly alone with his thoughts."
62752. 
62753. "Well, I don't think you need reproach yourself on his account. All that
62754. the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for
62755. him, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This
62756. evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and fancy--as we were
62757. going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to
62758. bits, and he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an
62759. untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!" repeated Nicholas, who at heart was
62760. not fond of Nicholas Bolkonski but was always anxious to recognize that
62761. he was a fine lad.
62762. 
62763. "Still, I am not the same as his own mother," said Countess Mary. "I
62764. feel I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am
62765. dreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for him to have companions."
62766. 
62767. "Well it won't be for long. Next summer I'll take him to Petersburg,"
62768. said Nicholas. "Yes, Pierre always was a dreamer and always will be,"
62769. he continued, returning to the talk in the study which had evidently
62770. disturbed him. "Well, what business is it of mine what goes on
62771. there--whether Arakcheev is bad, and all that? What business was it of
62772. mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with
62773. prison, and had a mother who could not see or understand it? And
62774. then there are you and the children and our affairs. Is it for my own
62775. pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?
62776. No, but I know I must work to comfort my mother, to repay you, and not
62777. to leave the children such beggars as I was."
62778. 
62779. Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone
62780. and that he attached too much importance to these matters. But she knew
62781. she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only
62782. took his hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of approval and
62783. a confirmation of his thoughts, and after a few minutes' reflection
62784. continued to think aloud.
62785. 
62786. "You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofanych" (this was his overseer) "came
62787. back from the Tambov estate and told me they are already offering eighty
62788. thousand rubles for the forest."
62789. 
62790. And with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of
62791. repurchasing Otradnoe before long, and added: "Another ten years of life
62792. and I shall leave the children... in an excellent position."
62793. 
62794. Countess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told
62795. her. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes
62796. ask her what he had been saying, and be vexed if he noticed that she
62797. had been thinking about something else. But she had to force herself to
62798. attend, for what he was saying did not interest her at all. She looked
62799. at him and did not think, but felt, about something different. She felt
62800. a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all
62801. that she understood, and this seemed to make her love for him still
62802. stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness. Besides this
62803. feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following
62804. the details of her husband's plans, thoughts that had no connection with
62805. what he was saying flitted through her mind. She thought of her nephew.
62806. Her husband's account of the boy's agitation while Pierre was speaking
62807. struck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive
62808. character recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she
62809. thought also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but
62810. compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt
62811. with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young
62812. Nicholas.
62813. 
62814. Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the
62815. difference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and
62816. promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible--in
62817. this life to love her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and all
62818. her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess Mary's soul always
62819. strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could
62820. therefore never be at peace. A stern expression of the lofty, secret
62821. suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas
62822. gazed at her. "O God! What will become of us if she dies, as I always
62823. fear when her face is like that?" thought he, and placing himself before
62824. the icon he began to say his evening prayers.
62825. 
62826. 
62827. 
62828. 
62829. 
62830. CHAPTER XVI
62831. 
62832. 
62833. Natasha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband
62834. and wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity,
62835. understanding and expressing each other's thoughts in ways contrary to
62836. all rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and in
62837. a quite peculiar way. Natasha was so used to this kind of talk with her
62838. husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong
62839. between them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning. When he
62840. began proving anything, or talking argumentatively and calmly and she,
62841. led on by his example, began to do the same, she knew that they were on
62842. the verge of a quarrel.
62843. 
62844. From the moment they were alone and Natasha came up to him with
62845. wide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her
62846. bosom, saying: "Now you are all mine, mine! You won't escape!"--from
62847. that moment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic
62848. and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about
62849. at one and the same time. This simultaneous discussion of many topics
62850. did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest
62851. sign that they fully understood one another.
62852. 
62853. Just as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and
62854. contradictory, except the feeling that guides the dream, so in this
62855. intercourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words themselves were
62856. not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them.
62857. 
62858. Natasha spoke to Pierre about her brother's life and doings, of how she
62859. had suffered and lacked life during his own absence, and of how she
62860. was fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was in every way better than
62861. herself. In saying this Natasha was sincere in acknowledging Mary's
62862. superiority, but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on
62863. Pierre that he should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and to all
62864. other women, and that now, especially after having seen many women in
62865. Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh.
62866. 
62867. Pierre, answering Natasha's words, told her how intolerable it had been
62868. for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.
62869. 
62870. "I have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies," he said. "It was
62871. simply dull. Besides, I was very busy."
62872. 
62873. Natasha looked intently at him and went on:
62874. 
62875. "Mary is so splendid," she said. "How she understands children! It is as
62876. if she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, for instance, Mitya was
62877. naughty..."
62878. 
62879. "How like his father he is," Pierre interjected.
62880. 
62881. Natasha knew why he mentioned Mitya's likeness to Nicholas: the
62882. recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and
62883. he wanted to know what Natasha thought of it.
62884. 
62885. "Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally
62886. accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh line,"
62887. said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.
62888. 
62889. "No, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are
62890. an amusement--almost a pastime," said Pierre. "For instance, he is
62891. collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book
62892. till he has read what he had already bought--Sismondi and Rousseau and
62893. Montesquieu," he added with a smile. "You know how much I..." he began
62894. to soften down what he had said; but Natasha interrupted him to show
62895. that this was unnecessary.
62896. 
62897. "So you say ideas are an amusement to him...."
62898. 
62899. "Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg I
62900. saw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all else is
62901. mere amusement."
62902. 
62903. "Ah, I'm so sorry I wasn't there when you met the children," said
62904. Natasha. "Which was most delighted? Lisa, I'm sure."
62905. 
62906. "Yes," Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind. "Nicholas
62907. says we ought not to think. But I can't help it. Besides, when I was in
62908. Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go
62909. to pieces without me--everyone was pulling his own way. But I succeeded
62910. in uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear and simple. You see,
62911. I don't say that we ought to oppose this and that. We may be mistaken.
62912. What I say is: 'Join hands, you who love the right, and let there be but
62913. one banner--that of active virtue.' Prince Sergey is a fine fellow and
62914. clever."
62915. 
62916. Natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierre's idea,
62917. but one thing disconcerted her. "Can a man so important and necessary to
62918. society be also my husband? How did this happen?" She wished to express
62919. this doubt to him. "Now who could decide whether he is really cleverer
62920. than all the others?" she asked herself, and passed in review all those
62921. whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one
62922. he had respected so highly as Platon Karataev.
62923. 
62924. "Do you know what I am thinking about?" she asked. "About Platon
62925. Karataev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?"
62926. 
62927. Pierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood his
62928. wife's line of thought.
62929. 
62930. "Platon Karataev?" he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely
62931. trying to imagine Karataev's opinion on the subject. "He would not have
62932. understood... yet perhaps he would."
62933. 
62934. "I love you awfully!" Natasha suddenly said. "Awfully, awfully!"
62935. 
62936. "No, he would not have approved," said Pierre, after reflection. "What
62937. he would have approved of is our family life. He was always so anxious
62938. to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should
62939. have been proud to let him see us. There now--you talk of my absence,
62940. but you wouldn't believe what a special feeling I have for you after a
62941. separation...."
62942. 
62943. "Yes, I should think..." Natasha began.
62944. 
62945. "No, it's not that. I never leave off loving you. And one couldn't love
62946. more, but this is something special.... Yes, of course-" he did not
62947. finish because their eyes meeting said the rest.
62948. 
62949. "What nonsense it is," Natasha suddenly exclaimed, "about honeymoons,
62950. and that the greatest happiness is at first! On the contrary, now is
62951. the best of all. If only you did not go away! Do you remember how
62952. we quarreled? And it was always my fault. Always mine. And what we
62953. quarreled about--I don't even remember!"
62954. 
62955. "Always about the same thing," said Pierre with a smile. "Jealo..."
62956. 
62957. "Don't say it! I can't bear it!" Natasha cried, and her eyes glittered
62958. coldly and vindictively. "Did you see her?" she added, after a pause.
62959. 
62960. "No, and if I had I shouldn't have recognized her."
62961. 
62962. They were silent for a while.
62963. 
62964. "Oh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at
62965. you," Natasha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had
62966. come over them. "You are as like him as two peas--like the boy." (She
62967. meant her little son.) "Oh, it's time to go to him.... The milk's
62968. come.... But I'm sorry to leave you."
62969. 
62970. They were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning to one
62971. another at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre began with
62972. self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Natasha with a quiet, happy smile.
62973. Having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other
62974. continue.
62975. 
62976. "No. What did you say? Go on, go on."
62977. 
62978. "No, you go on, I was talking nonsense," said Natasha.
62979. 
62980. Pierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his complacent
62981. reflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment it seemed to
62982. him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of Russian
62983. society and to the whole world.
62984. 
62985. "I only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always
62986. simple ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people are united and
62987. constitute a power, then honest folk must do the same. Now that's simple
62988. enough."
62989. 
62990. "Yes."
62991. 
62992. "And what were you going to say?"
62993. 
62994. "I? Only nonsense."
62995. 
62996. "But all the same?"
62997. 
62998. "Oh nothing, only a trifle," said Natasha, smilingly still more
62999. brightly. "I only wanted to tell you about Petya: today nurse was coming
63000. to take him from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung to me. I'm
63001. sure he thought he was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now he's crying.
63002. Well, good-by!" and she left the room.
63003. 
63004. 
63005. Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkonski's bedroom a little lamp
63006. was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark and they could
63007. not cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his
63008. Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring. Little Nicholas, who had
63009. just waked up in a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed before him
63010. with wide-open eyes. He had awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed
63011. that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted in
63012. his Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white
63013. slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in
63014. autumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la Vierge. In front was
63015. Glory, which was similar to those threads but rather thicker. He and
63016. Pierre were borne along lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer to their
63017. goal. Suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become
63018. entangled and it grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before
63019. them in a stern and threatening attitude.
63020. 
63021. "Have you done this?" he said, pointing to some broken sealing wax and
63022. pens. "I loved you, but I have orders from Arakcheev and will kill
63023. the first of you who moves forward." Little Nicholas turned to look
63024. at Pierre but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his
63025. father--Prince Andrew--and his father had neither shape nor form, but he
63026. existed, and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love:
63027. he felt himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father caressed and
63028. pitied him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror
63029. seized young Nicholas and he awoke.
63030. 
63031. "My father!" he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of Prince
63032. Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.) "My
63033. father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle
63034. Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned
63035. his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know
63036. they want me to learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have
63037. finished learning, and then I will do something. I only pray God that
63038. something may happen to me such as happened to Plutarch's men, and I
63039. will act as they did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, love me,
63040. and be delighted with me!" And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and
63041. he began to cry.
63042. 
63043. "Are you ill?" he heard Dessalles' voice asking.
63044. 
63045. "No," answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.
63046. 
63047. "He is good and kind and I am fond of him!" he thought of Dessalles.
63048. "But Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father? Oh,
63049. Father, Father! Yes, I will do something with which even he would be
63050. satisfied...."
63051. 
63052. 
63053. 
63054. 
63055. 
63056. SECOND EPILOGUE
63057. 
63058. 
63059. 
63060. 
63061. 
63062. CHAPTER I
63063. 
63064. 
63065. History is the life of nations and of humanity. To seize and put into
63066. words, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single
63067. nation, appears impossible.
63068. 
63069. The ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe
63070. and seize the apparently elusive--the life of a people. They described
63071. the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded the
63072. activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation.
63073. 
63074. The question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by
63075. what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients
63076. met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of
63077. a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish
63078. ends that were predestined.
63079. 
63080. For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct
63081. participation of the Deity in human affairs.
63082. 
63083. Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.
63084. 
63085. It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man's
63086. subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations
63087. are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but
63088. the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having
63089. in theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them
63090. in practice.
63091. 
63092. Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by
63093. the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with
63094. extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various
63095. kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. Instead of the
63096. former divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations,
63097. which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of
63098. humanity, modern history has postulated its own aims--the welfare of the
63099. French, German, or English people, or, in its highest abstraction, the
63100. welfare and civilization of humanity in general, by which is usually
63101. meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a
63102. large continent.
63103. 
63104. Modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without
63105. replacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has
63106. obliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected the divine
63107. authority of the kings and the "fate" of the ancients, to reach the same
63108. conclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations guided
63109. by individual men, and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these
63110. nations and humanity at large are tending.
63111. 
63112. At the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon to
63113. Buckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of
63114. their outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.
63115. 
63116. In the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals
63117. who in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian considers
63118. only monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such men, while another
63119. includes also orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets).
63120. Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led
63121. is known to the historians: to one of them this goal is the greatness of
63122. the Roman, Spanish, or French realm; to another it is liberty, equality,
63123. and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called
63124. Europe.
63125. 
63126. In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is expressed
63127. by a movement of peoples from west to east. Several times it moves
63128. eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward.
63129. In 1812 it reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with remarkable
63130. symmetry, a countermovement occurs from east to west, attracting to
63131. it, as the first movement had done, the nations of middle Europe. The
63132. counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the
63133. west--Paris--and subsides.
63134. 
63135. During that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left
63136. untilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions
63137. of men migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions
63138. of Christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one
63139. another.
63140. 
63141. What does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people burn
63142. houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these events?
63143. What force made men act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and
63144. most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the
63145. monuments and tradition of that period.
63146. 
63147. For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the
63148. science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know
63149. themselves.
63150. 
63151. If history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have
63152. said that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and
63153. directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply,
63154. would have been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve
63155. in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in
63156. it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that
63157. period, nor would there have been any contradictions.
63158. 
63159. But modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the
63160. conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity
63161. in human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other answers.
63162. 
63163. Modern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what
63164. this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these
63165. events? Then listen:
63166. 
63167. "Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and such
63168. mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly. His
63169. descendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly. And they had
63170. such and such favorites and such and such mistresses. Moreover, certain
63171. men wrote some books at that time. At the end of the eighteenth century
63172. there were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all
63173. men being free and equal. This caused people all over France to begin
63174. to slash at and drown one another. They killed the king and many other
63175. people. At that time there was in France a man of genius--Napoleon. He
63176. conquered everybody everywhere--that is, he killed many people because
63177. he was a great genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and
63178. killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to
63179. France he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him. Having
63180. become an Emperor he again went out to kill people in Italy, Austria,
63181. and Prussia. And there too he killed a great many. In Russia there
63182. was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and
63183. therefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends
63184. with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many
63185. people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured
63186. Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor
63187. Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to
63188. arm against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleon's allies suddenly
63189. became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he
63190. raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to
63191. abdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the
63192. title of Emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before
63193. and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand.
63194. Then Louis XVIII, who till then had been the laughingstock both of the
63195. French and the Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears
63196. before his Old Guards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then
63197. the skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who
63198. managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and
63199. thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by
63200. these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the
63201. diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of
63202. again ordering their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon
63203. arrived in France with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating
63204. him, immediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were
63205. angry at this and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated
63206. the genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent him
63207. to the island of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the beloved
63208. France so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that rock and
63209. bequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reaction
63210. occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their
63211. subjects."
63212. 
63213. It would be a mistake to think that this is ironic--a caricature of the
63214. historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild expression of
63215. the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions, which all the
63216. historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the histories
63217. of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new
63218. histories of the culture of that period.
63219. 
63220. The strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that
63221. modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.
63222. 
63223. If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of
63224. humanity and of the peoples, the first question--in the absence of a
63225. reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible--is: what is the
63226. power that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously replies
63227. either that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was very
63228. proud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.
63229. 
63230. All that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not
63231. what was asked. All that would be interesting if we recognized a divine
63232. power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations
63233. through Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not acknowledge such
63234. a power, and therefore before speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and
63235. authors, we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men
63236. and the movement of the nations.
63237. 
63238. If instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it should
63239. be explained in what this new force consists, for the whole interest of
63240. history lies precisely in that force.
63241. 
63242. History seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to
63243. everyone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone
63244. reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new
63245. force, so variously understood by the historians themselves, is really
63246. quite well known to everybody.
63247. 
63248. 
63249. 
63250. 
63251. 
63252. CHAPTER II
63253. 
63254. 
63255. What force moves the nations?
63256. 
63257. Biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand
63258. this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration
63259. events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and Alexander, or in
63260. general of the persons they describe. The answers given by this kind
63261. of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are
63262. satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event.
63263. As soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin
63264. to describe the same event, the replies they give immediately lose all
63265. meaning, for this force is understood by them all not only differently
63266. but often in quite contradictory ways. One historian says that an
63267. event was produced by Napoleon's power, another that it was produced by
63268. Alexander's, a third that it was due to the power of some other person.
63269. Besides this, historians of that kind contradict each other even
63270. in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some
63271. particular person was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleon's
63272. power was based on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it
63273. was based on his trickery and deception of the people. So the historians
63274. of this class, by mutually destroying one another's positions, destroy
63275. the understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no
63276. reply to history's essential question.
63277. 
63278. Writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to
63279. recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians' view of the force
63280. which produces events. They do not recognize it as a power inherent in
63281. heroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously
63282. directed forces. In describing a war or the subjugation of a people, a
63283. general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power
63284. of one man, but in the interaction of many persons connected with the
63285. event.
63286. 
63287. According to this view the power of historical personages, represented
63288. as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded
63289. as a force that itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal
63290. historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself
63291. produces events, and treat it as their cause. In their exposition, an
63292. historic character is first the product of his time, and his power only
63293. the resultant of various forces, and then his power is itself a force
63294. producing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one
63295. time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the ideas of
63296. 1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812
63297. and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleon's
63298. misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their
63299. development by Napoleon's caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the
63300. general temper of the age produced Napoleon's power. But Napoleon's
63301. power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of
63302. the age.
63303. 
63304. This curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur at
63305. every step, but the universal historians' accounts are all made up of
63306. a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs because after
63307. entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway.
63308. 
63309. To find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force, the
63310. sum of the components must equal the resultant. This condition is never
63311. observed by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant
63312. forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient
63313. components, another unexplained force affecting the resultant action.
63314. 
63315. Specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration
63316. of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the
63317. will of Alexander. But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this
63318. opinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of
63319. 1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside
63320. Alexander's will--such as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame
63321. de Stael, Talleyrand, Fichte Chateaubriand, and others. The historian
63322. evidently decomposes Alexander's power into the components: Talleyrand,
63323. Chateaubriand, and the rest--but the sum of the components, that is,
63324. the interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Stael, and the
63325. others, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon
63326. of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand,
63327. Madame de Stael, and others spoke certain words to one another only
63328. affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission
63329. of millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs
63330. the submission of millions of people resulted--that is, how component
63331. forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A--the
63332. historian is again obliged to fall back on power--the force he had
63333. denied--and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he
63334. has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And that is
63335. just what the universal historians do, and consequently they not only
63336. contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves.
63337. 
63338. Peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to
63339. whether they want rain or fine weather: "The wind has blown the clouds
63340. away," or, "The wind has brought up the clouds." And in the same way the
63341. universal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in with
63342. their theory, say that power is the result of events, and sometimes,
63343. when they want to prove something else, say that power produces events.
63344. 
63345. A third class of historians--the so-called historians of
63346. culture--following the path laid down by the universal historians who
63347. sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events--again
63348. take that force to be something quite different. They see it in what is
63349. called culture--in mental activity.
63350. 
63351. The historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their
63352. progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical
63353. events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one
63354. another in such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that
63355. such and such people wrote such and such books? Of the immense number of
63356. indications accompanying every vital phenomenon, these historians select
63357. the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is
63358. the cause. But despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events
63359. lies in intellectual activity, only by a great stretch can one admit
63360. that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the
63361. movement of peoples, and in no case can one admit that intellectual
63362. activity controls people's actions, for that view is not confirmed by
63363. such facts as the very cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting
63364. from the doctrine of the equality of man, or the very cruel wars and
63365. executions resulting from the preaching of love.
63366. 
63367. But even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with
63368. which these histories are filled--admitting that nations are governed by
63369. some undefined force called an idea--history's essential question still
63370. remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the
63371. influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal
63372. historians, another, newer force--the idea--is added, the connection of
63373. which with the masses needs explanation. It is possible to understand
63374. that Napoleon had power and so events occurred; with some effort one may
63375. even conceive that Napoleon together with other influences was the cause
63376. of an event; but how a book, Le Contrat social, had the effect of making
63377. Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an
63378. explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event.
63379. 
63380. Undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously,
63381. and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual
63382. activity of men and their historical movements, just as such a
63383. connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce,
63384. handicraft, gardening, or anything else you please. But why intellectual
63385. activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or
63386. expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand.
63387. Only the following considerations can have led the historians to such
63388. a conclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men, and so it is
63389. natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class
63390. supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar
63391. belief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers
63392. (if they do not express it, that is merely because traders and soldiers
63393. do not write history), and (2) that spiritual activity, enlightenment,
63394. civilization, culture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite conceptions
63395. under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less
63396. definite meaning, and which can therefore be readily introduced into any
63397. theory.
63398. 
63399. But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind
63400. (which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the
63401. histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and more
63402. to approximate, are significant from the fact that after seriously
63403. and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and political
63404. doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to describe an
63405. actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they
63406. involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power--and
63407. say plainly that that was the result of Napoleon's will. Speaking so,
63408. the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show
63409. that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens
63410. in history, and that history can only be explained by introducing a
63411. power which they apparently do not recognize.
63412. 
63413. 
63414. 
63415. 
63416. 
63417. CHAPTER III
63418. 
63419. 
63420. A locomotive is moving. Someone asks: "What moves it?" A peasant says
63421. the devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because its
63422. wheels go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in
63423. the smoke which the wind carries away.
63424. 
63425. The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. To
63426. refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil,
63427. or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil
63428. but a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as a result of the
63429. contradiction, will they see that they are both wrong. But the man who
63430. says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself, for
63431. having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why
63432. the wheels go round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the
63433. movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler, he
63434. has no right to stop in his search for the cause. The man who explains
63435. the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has
63436. noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the
63437. first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an
63438. explanation.
63439. 
63440. The only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is
63441. that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.
63442. 
63443. The only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that
63444. of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples.
63445. 
63446. Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of
63447. different kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement
63448. observed. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the
63449. peasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force resulting
63450. from several other forces, like the movement of the wheels; others again
63451. as an intellectual influence, like the smoke that is blown away.
63452. 
63453. So long as histories are written of separate individuals, whether
63454. Caesars, Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories
63455. of all, absolutely all those who take part in an event, it is quite
63456. impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception
63457. of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end.
63458. And the only such conception known to historians is that of power.
63459. 
63460. This conception is the one handle by means of which the material of
63461. history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who
63462. breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other method
63463. of treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the one
63464. possible way of dealing with it. The necessity of the conception of
63465. power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by
63466. the universal historians and historians of culture themselves, for they
63467. professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at
63468. every step.
63469. 
63470. In dealing with humanity's inquiry, the science of history up to now
63471. is like money in circulation--paper money and coin. The biographies and
63472. special national histories are like paper money. They can be used and
63473. can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even
63474. advantageously, as long as no one asks what is the security behind them.
63475. You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and
63476. such histories as Thiers' will be interesting and instructive and may
63477. perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real
63478. value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much
63479. of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also
63480. doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because
63481. too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart
63482. someone inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?--that is, wants
63483. to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual
63484. comprehension.
63485. 
63486. The writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are
63487. like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to
63488. substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity
63489. of gold. It may indeed make jingling coin, but will do no more than
63490. that. Paper money may deceive the ignorant, but nobody is deceived by
63491. tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle. As gold is
63492. gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use,
63493. so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to
63494. history's essential question: what is power? The universal historians
63495. give contradictory replies to that question, while the historians of
63496. culture evade it and answer something quite different. And as counters
63497. of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to
63498. accept them as gold, or among those who do not know the nature of
63499. gold, so universal historians and historians of culture, not answering
63500. humanity's essential question, serve as currency for some purposes of
63501. their own, only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a
63502. taste for what they call "serious reading."
63503. 
63504. 
63505. 
63506. 
63507. 
63508. CHAPTER IV
63509. 
63510. 
63511. Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine
63512. subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection
63513. of that man's will to the Deity, history cannot without contradictions
63514. take a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return
63515. to the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human
63516. affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing
63517. historical events and termed "power."
63518. 
63519. A return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and
63520. so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.
63521. 
63522. Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are so
63523. accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question:
63524. why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered
63525. certain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and so what he
63526. ordered was done.
63527. 
63528. This reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given
63529. him by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes essential to
63530. determine what is this power of one man over others.
63531. 
63532. It cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak
63533. one--a domination based on the application or threat of physical force,
63534. like the power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral
63535. force, as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the
63536. leading figures in history are heroes, that is, men gifted with a
63537. special strength of soul and mind called genius. This power cannot be
63538. based on the predominance of moral strength, for, not to mention heroes
63539. such as Napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely,
63540. history shows us that neither a Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled
63541. over millions of people, had any particular moral qualities, but on the
63542. contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they
63543. ruled over.
63544. 
63545. If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral
63546. qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for
63547. elsewhere--in the relation to the people of the man who wields the
63548. power.
63549. 
63550. And that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence,
63551. that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history's
63552. understanding of power for true gold.
63553. 
63554. Power is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or
63555. tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.
63556. 
63557. In the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a
63558. state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to
63559. be arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that
63560. definition of power needs explanation.
63561. 
63562. The science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients
63563. regarded fire--namely, as something existing absolutely. But for
63564. history, the state and power are merely phenomena, just as for modern
63565. physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon.
63566. 
63567. From this fundamental difference between the view held by history and
63568. that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell
63569. minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what
63570. power--existing immutably outside time--is, but to history's questions
63571. about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer
63572. nothing.
63573. 
63574. If power be the collective will of the people transferred to their
63575. ruler, was Pugachev a representative of the will of the people? If not,
63576. then why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon III a criminal when he was
63577. taken prisoner at Boulogne, and why, later on, were those criminals whom
63578. he arrested?
63579. 
63580. Do palace revolutions--in which sometimes only two or three people take
63581. part--transfer the will of the people to a new ruler? In international
63582. relations, is the will of the people also transferred to their
63583. conqueror? Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine transferred
63584. to Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Russian people transferred
63585. to Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with the French went to
63586. fight the Austrians?
63587. 
63588. To these questions three answers are possible:
63589. 
63590. Either to assume (1) that the will of the people is always
63591. unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and
63592. that therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle
63593. against the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded as an
63594. infringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of the people
63595. is transferred to the rulers conditionally, under definite and known
63596. conditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, and even
63597. destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the
63598. conditions under which their power was entrusted to them; or (3) that
63599. the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally, but
63600. that the conditions are unknown and indefinite, and that the appearance
63601. of several authorities, their struggles and their falls, result solely
63602. from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown
63603. conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some
63604. people to others.
63605. 
63606. And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the
63607. relation of the people to their rulers.
63608. 
63609. Some historians--those biographical and specialist historians already
63610. referred to--in their simplicity failing to understand the question of
63611. the meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective will of
63612. the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons, and
63613. therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular
63614. power to be the one absolute and real power, and that any other force
63615. opposing this is not a power but a violation of power--mere violence.
63616. 
63617. Their theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history,
63618. has the inconvenience--in application to complex and stormy periods in
63619. the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and
63620. struggle with one another--that a Legitimist historian will prove
63621. that the National Convention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere
63622. infringers of the true power, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will
63623. prove: the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the
63624. real power, and that all the others were violations of power.
63625. Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually
63626. contradictory can only satisfy young children.
63627. 
63628. Recognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of
63629. historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will
63630. of the people to their rulers, and that historical leaders have power
63631. only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the
63632. people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them. But what this program
63633. consists in these historians do not say, or if they do they continually
63634. contradict one another.
63635. 
63636. Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation's
63637. progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom,
63638. or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not
63639. to mention the historians' contradictions as to the nature of this
63640. program--or even admitting that some one general program of these
63641. conditions exists--the facts of history almost always contradict that
63642. theory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the
63643. wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis
63644. XIV and Ivan the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI
63645. and Charles I are executed by their people? To this question historians
63646. reply that Louis XIV's activity, contrary to the program, reacted on
63647. Louis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV--why
63648. should it react just on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for such
63649. reactions? To these questions there are and can be no answers. Equally
63650. little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective
63651. will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and
63652. then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the
63653. Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII,
63654. to Napoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican
63655. government, and to Napoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers
63656. of the people's will from one individual to another, especially in view
63657. of international relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians are
63658. obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations
63659. of the people's will but are accidents dependent on cunning, on
63660. mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, a ruler, or a
63661. party leader. So that the greater part of the events of history--civil
63662. wars, revolutions, and conquests--are presented by these historians
63663. not as the results of free transferences of the people's will, but as
63664. results of the ill-directed will of one or more individuals, that is,
63665. once again, as usurpations of power. And so these historians also see
63666. and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory.
63667. 
63668. These historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some
63669. plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that all
63670. that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the palm, the
63671. mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth and no longer
63672. resemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.
63673. 
63674. Historians of the third class assume that the will of the people
63675. is transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the
63676. conditions are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have
63677. power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been
63678. delegated to them.
63679. 
63680. But in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the
63681. historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have
63682. those leaders?
63683. 
63684. The leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people:
63685. the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.
63686. 
63687. But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
63688. leaders serves as an expression of the people's will or only some part
63689. of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of
63690. the people's will, as some historians suppose, then all the details
63691. of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or
63692. a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is evident
63693. nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an
63694. historical leader which serves to express the people's life, as other
63695. so-called "philosophical" historians believe, then to determine which
63696. side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation's life, we have
63697. first of all to know in what the nation's life consists.
63698. 
63699. Met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most
63700. obscure, impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all
63701. conceivable occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of
63702. humanity's movement. The most usual generalizations adopted by almost
63703. all the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, progress,
63704. civilization, and culture. Postulating some generalization as the goal
63705. of the movement of humanity, the historians study the men of whom the
63706. greatest number of monuments have remained: kings, ministers, generals,
63707. authors, reformers, popes, and journalists, to the extent to which in
63708. their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction.
63709. But as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in
63710. freedom, equality, enlightenment, or civilization, and as the connection
63711. of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based
63712. on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is
63713. always transferred to the men whom we have noticed, it happens that the
63714. activity of the millions who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture,
63715. and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the
63716. activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses, practice
63717. agriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.
63718. 
63719. History proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples of
63720. the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward
63721. explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their mistresses
63722. and ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Diderot,
63723. Beaumarchais, and others?
63724. 
63725. Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kazan and Siberia
63726. expressed by details of the morbid character of Ivan the Terrible and by
63727. his correspondence with Kurbski?
63728. 
63729. Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by
63730. the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies?
63731. For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without
63732. leaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains
63733. incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that
63734. movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusade--the deliverance
63735. of Jerusalem--had been clearly defined by historic leaders. Popes,
63736. kings, and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the
63737. people did not go, for the unknown cause which had previously impelled
63738. them to go no longer existed. The history of the Godfreys and the
63739. Minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples. And the
63740. history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history
63741. of Godfreys and Minnesingers, but the history of the life of the peoples
63742. and their impulses has remained unknown.
63743. 
63744. Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the
63745. life of the peoples.
63746. 
63747. The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of
63748. life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had
63749. a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was
63750. suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after
63751. the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the
63752. French Revolution they guillotined one another.
63753. 
63754. If we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest
63755. historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not
63756. the history of the life of the peoples.
63757. 
63758. 
63759. 
63760. 
63761. 
63762. CHAPTER V
63763. 
63764. 
63765. The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for
63766. the connection between those men and the nations has not been found.
63767. The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the
63768. collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an
63769. hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history.
63770. 
63771. The theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to
63772. historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence
63773. and be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as
63774. soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occur--that is, as soon as
63775. history begins--that theory explains nothing.
63776. 
63777. The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the
63778. people's will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.
63779. 
63780. Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the
63781. theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because
63782. the collective will was transferred to him.
63783. 
63784. The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the
63785. replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and
63786. paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different
63787. parts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute
63788. the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.
63789. 
63790. "The herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads
63791. it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that
63792. leader." This is what historians of the first class say--those who
63793. assume the unconditional transference of the people's will.
63794. 
63795. "If the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the
63796. collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to
63797. another, according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in
63798. the direction selected by the whole herd." Such is the reply historians
63799. who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to
63800. rulers under conditions which they regard as known. (With this method
63801. of observation it often happens that the observer, influenced by the
63802. direction he himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the
63803. people's change of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side,
63804. or even in the rear.)
63805. 
63806. "If the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of
63807. the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow
63808. a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that
63809. have attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd
63810. we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all
63811. sides of the herd." So say the third class of historians who regard all
63812. historical persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of
63813. their age.
63814. 
63815. The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic
63816. persons is merely a paraphrase--a restatement of the question in other
63817. words.
63818. 
63819. What causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the
63820. collective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what
63821. condition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On
63822. condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That
63823. is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which
63824. we do not understand.
63825. 
63826. 
63827. If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning,
63828. then having subjected to criticism the explanation of "power" that
63829. juridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely
63830. a word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena man
63831. has, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies his
63832. reflections. And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but
63833. an actually existing phenomenon.
63834. 
63835. Not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity
63836. of men can do without the conception of power, the existence of power is
63837. proved both by history and by observing contemporary events.
63838. 
63839. Whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose will the
63840. event seems to have taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree and the
63841. French go to Mexico. The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and
63842. an army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters
63843. Russia. Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the
63844. Bourbons. Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always
63845. related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it.
63846. 
63847. The historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine
63848. intervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in
63849. the expression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that
63850. supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.
63851. 
63852. On the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man's
63853. will--his words--are only part of the general activity expressed in an
63854. event, as for instance in a war or a revolution, and so without assuming
63855. an incomprehensible, supernatural force--a miracle--one cannot admit
63856. that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of
63857. men. On the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the
63858. cause of events, history shows that the expression of the will of
63859. historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect, that
63860. is to say, their commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very
63861. opposite of what they order occurs.
63862. 
63863. Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we
63864. cannot regard "power" as the cause of events.
63865. 
63866. Power, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation that
63867. exists between the expression of someone's will and the execution of
63868. that will by others.
63869. 
63870. To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a
63871. conception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the
63872. Deity.
63873. 
63874. If the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history
63875. tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not
63876. caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event. But
63877. speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting
63878. in time and in relation to one another, to explain the connection of
63879. commands with events we must restore: (1) the condition of all that
63880. takes place: the continuity of movement in time both of the events and
63881. of the person who commands, and (2) the inevitability of the connection
63882. between the person commanding and those who execute his command.
63883. 
63884. 
63885. 
63886. 
63887. 
63888. CHAPTER VI
63889. 
63890. 
63891. Only the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent on time, can
63892. relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or
63893. centuries, and only the Deity, independent of everything, can by His
63894. sole will determine the direction of humanity's movement; but man acts
63895. in time and himself takes part in what occurs.
63896. 
63897. Reinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no
63898. command can be executed without some preceding order having been given
63899. rendering the execution of the last command possible.
63900. 
63901. No command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series
63902. of occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers
63903. to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.
63904. 
63905. When, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war,
63906. we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive
63907. commands dependent one on another. Napoleon could not have commanded
63908. an invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered such and such
63909. papers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg;
63910. tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the
63911. commissariat, and so on and so on--millions of commands, which formed
63912. a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the
63913. French armies into Russia.
63914. 
63915. If throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion
63916. of England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort,
63917. and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that
63918. design but undertook an expedition into Russia, with which country he
63919. considered it desirable to be in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly
63920. expressed)--this came about because his commands did not correspond to
63921. the course of events in the first case, but did so correspond in the
63922. latter.
63923. 
63924. For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should
63925. order what can be executed. But to know what can and what cannot be
63926. executed is impossible, not only in the case of Napoleon's invasion of
63927. Russia in which millions participated, but even in the simplest event,
63928. for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its
63929. execution. Every order executed is always one of an immense number
63930. unexecuted. All the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of
63931. events remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones get linked up with a
63932. consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events, and
63933. are executed.
63934. 
63935. Our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes
63936. it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of
63937. thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that
63938. event have been executed, we forget about the others that were not
63939. executed because they could not be. Apart from that, the chief source
63940. of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical
63941. accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such
63942. for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia, is
63943. generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that
63944. series of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole
63945. series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will.
63946. 
63947. We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In
63948. reality in all Napoleon's activity we never find anything resembling an
63949. expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions of
63950. his will, very variously and indefinitely directed. Amid a long series
63951. of unexecuted orders of Napoleon's one series, for the campaign of 1812,
63952. was carried out--not because those orders differed in any way from the
63953. other, unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of
63954. events that led the French army into Russia; just as in stencil work
63955. this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from
63956. this side or in that way, but because it was laid on from all sides over
63957. the figure cut in the stencil.
63958. 
63959. So that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events,
63960. we find that a command can never be the cause of the event, but that a
63961. certain definite dependence exists between the two.
63962. 
63963. To understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to
63964. reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from
63965. the Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who gives the command
63966. himself takes part in the event.
63967. 
63968. This relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is
63969. called power. This relation consists in the following:
63970. 
63971. For common action people always unite in certain combinations, in which
63972. regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action, the
63973. relation between those taking part in it is always the same.
63974. 
63975. Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward
63976. one another that the larger number take a more direct share, and the
63977. smaller number a less direct share, in the collective action for which
63978. they have combined.
63979. 
63980. Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of
63981. the most striking and definite examples is an army.
63982. 
63983. Every army is composed of lower grades of the service--the rank and
63984. file--of whom there are always the greatest number; of the next higher
63985. military rank--corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are
63986. fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer,
63987. and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one
63988. person.
63989. 
63990. A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone, of
63991. which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file;
63992. the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next
63993. higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point of which
63994. will represent the commander in chief.
63995. 
63996. The soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of
63997. the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking,
63998. burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions
63999. from men above him; he himself never gives an order. The noncommissioned
64000. officers (of whom there are fewer) perform the action itself less
64001. frequently than the soldiers, but they already give commands. An
64002. officer still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more
64003. frequently. A general does nothing but command the troops, indicates the
64004. objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief
64005. never takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general
64006. orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops. A similar
64007. relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men
64008. for common activity--in agriculture, trade, and every administration.
64009. 
64010. And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of
64011. a cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in
64012. any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the
64013. highest, we see a law by which men, to take associated action, combine
64014. in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing
64015. the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are,
64016. while the less their direct participation in the action itself, the more
64017. they command and the fewer of them there are; rising in this way from
64018. the lowest ranks to the man at the top, who takes the least direct share
64019. in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding.
64020. 
64021. This relation of the men who command to those they command is what
64022. constitutes the essence of the conception called power.
64023. 
64024. Having restored the condition of time under which all events occur,
64025. we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a
64026. corresponding series of events. Restoring the essential condition of
64027. relation between those who command and those who execute, we find that
64028. by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part
64029. in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to
64030. commanding.
64031. 
64032. 
64033. 
64034. 
64035. 
64036. CHAPTER VII
64037. 
64038. 
64039. When an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes
64040. about it, and as the event results from the collective activity of
64041. many people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be
64042. fulfilled if but approximately. When one of the opinions expressed
64043. is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command
64044. preceding it.
64045. 
64046. Men are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to how and
64047. where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it happens that this is
64048. done as one of them said. He ordered it. There we have command and power
64049. in their primary form. The man who worked most with his hands could not
64050. think so much about what he was doing, or reflect on or command what
64051. would result from the common activity; while the man who commanded
64052. more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater
64053. verbal activity.
64054. 
64055. When some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim
64056. there is a yet sharper division of those who, because their activity is
64057. given to directing and commanding, take less part in the direct work.
64058. 
64059. When a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which
64060. as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his present
64061. activity, and guide him in planning his future actions. Just the same is
64062. done by a concourse of people, allowing those who do not take a direct
64063. part in the activity to devise considerations, justifications, and
64064. surmises concerning their collective activity.
64065. 
64066. For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill
64067. one another. And corresponding to the event its justification appears in
64068. people's belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France, for
64069. liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one another, and
64070. this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a
64071. centralization of power, resistance to Europe, and so on. Men went
64072. from the west to the east killing their fellow men, and the event
64073. was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France, the baseness of
64074. England, and so on. History shows us that these justifications of the
64075. events have no common sense and are all contradictory, as in the case of
64076. killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights, and the killing
64077. of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England. But these
64078. justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day.
64079. 
64080. These justifications release those who produce the events from moral
64081. responsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front
64082. of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they clear
64083. men's moral responsibilities from their path.
64084. 
64085. Without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest
64086. question that presents itself when examining each historical event. How
64087. is it that millions of men commit collective crimes--make war, commit
64088. murder, and so on?
64089. 
64090. With the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe
64091. can any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by monarchs,
64092. ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is there any
64093. collective action which cannot find its justification in political
64094. unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization? So
64095. that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed
64096. wish and, receiving a justification, presents itself as the result of
64097. the will of one man or of several men.
64098. 
64099. In whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts
64100. will always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board the ship the
64101. movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion.
64102. 
64103. Only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and
64104. comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that
64105. every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship,
64106. and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were
64107. imperceptibly moving.
64108. 
64109. We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical
64110. characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable condition of all that
64111. occurs--the continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of the
64112. essential connection of historical persons with the masses.
64113. 
64114. When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave
64115. ahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns
64116. frequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave
64117. anticipating its movement.
64118. 
64119. Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen
64120. and decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither
64121. directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a distance
64122. seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship's
64123. movement also.
64124. 
64125. 
64126. Examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons
64127. which, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed
64128. that the events depended on those commands. But examining the events
64129. themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to
64130. the people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on
64131. events. The incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however many
64132. commands were issued, the event does not take place unless there are
64133. other causes for it, but as soon as an event occurs--be it what it
64134. may--then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different
64135. people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time
64136. of utterance are related as commands to the events.
64137. 
64138. Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to
64139. these two essential questions of history:
64140. 
64141. (1) What is power?
64142. 
64143. (2) What force produces the movement of the nations?
64144. 
64145. (1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals,
64146. in which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and
64147. justifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is
64148. his participation in that action.
64149. 
64150. (2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual
64151. activity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have
64152. supposed, but by the activity of all the people who participate in
64153. the events, and who always combine in such a way that those taking
64154. the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least
64155. responsibility and vice versa.
64156. 
64157. Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically
64158. it is those who submit to the power. But as the moral activity is
64159. inconceivable without the physical, the cause of the event is neither in
64160. the one nor in the other but in the union of the two.
64161. 
64162. Or in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the
64163. phenomena we are examining.
64164. 
64165. In the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity--that final limit
64166. to which in every domain of thought man's reason arrives if it is not
64167. playing with the subject. Electricity produces heat, heat produces
64168. electricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another.
64169. 
64170. Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we
64171. cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is
64172. inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law. The
64173. same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we do
64174. not know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action,
64175. people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and
64176. we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other
64177. words that it is a law.
64178. 
64179. 
64180. 
64181. 
64182. 
64183. CHAPTER VIII
64184. 
64185. 
64186. If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this
64187. simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our
64188. argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter
64189. cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion
64190. and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history,
64191. says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law.
64192. 
64193. The presence of the problem of man's free will, though unexpressed, is
64194. felt at every step of history.
64195. 
64196. All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this
64197. question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the
64198. false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of
64199. a solution of that question.
64200. 
64201. If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he
64202. pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.
64203. 
64204. If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that
64205. is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that man's
64206. in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the
64207. possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity.
64208. 
64209. If there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot
64210. exist, for then man's will is subject to that law.
64211. 
64212. In this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most
64213. ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient
64214. times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.
64215. 
64216. The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation
64217. from whatever point of view--theological, historical, ethical, or
64218. philosophic--we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all
64219. that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what
64220. we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.
64221. 
64222. This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and
64223. independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself, but only
64224. through consciousness does he know himself.
64225. 
64226. Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason
64227. is conceivable.
64228. 
64229. To understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be
64230. conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of himself as
64231. a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of
64232. his volition. But his will--which forms the essence of his life--man
64233. recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.
64234. 
64235. If, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed by
64236. one and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of taking
64237. food, using his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize this
64238. never-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of
64239. it. Were it not free it could not be limited. A man's will seems to him
64240. to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free.
64241. 
64242. You say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall.
64243. Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable
64244. demonstration of freedom.
64245. 
64246. That reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to
64247. reason.
64248. 
64249. If the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent
64250. source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and
64251. to experience, but in fact such subjection does not exist and is
64252. inconceivable.
64253. 
64254. A series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he, as
64255. an object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man submits to
64256. them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he
64257. has become acquainted with them. But the same series of experiments
64258. and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is
64259. conscious in himself is impossible, and that his every action depends
64260. on his organization, his character, and the motives acting upon him; yet
64261. man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments.
64262. Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls
64263. downwards, a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law
64264. that he has learned to be fulfilled.
64265. 
64266. But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does
64267. not and cannot believe this.
64268. 
64269. However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the
64270. same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as
64271. before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character
64272. he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the
64273. same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment
64274. that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however
64275. incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is
64276. impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the
64277. same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which
64278. constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels
64279. that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception
64280. of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would
64281. be unable to live for a single moment.
64282. 
64283. He could not live, because all man's efforts, all his impulses to life,
64284. are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame and
64285. obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and
64286. disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger,
64287. virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.
64288. 
64289. A man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of
64290. life.
64291. 
64292. If the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless
64293. contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and
64294. the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that only
64295. proves that consciousness is not subject to reason.
64296. 
64297. This unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom, uncontrolled by
64298. experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone
64299. without exception, this consciousness without which no conception of man
64300. is possible constitutes the other side of the question.
64301. 
64302. Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God.
64303. What is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of
64304. man's freedom? That is a question for theology.
64305. 
64306. The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in
64307. statistics. What is man's responsibility to society, the conception of
64308. which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question for
64309. jurisprudence.
64310. 
64311. Man's actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting
64312. upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong
64313. in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? That is a
64314. question for ethics.
64315. 
64316. Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject
64317. to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that
64318. connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations and
64319. of humanity be regarded--as the result of the free, or as the result of
64320. the constrained, activity of man? That is a question for history.
64321. 
64322. Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of
64323. knowledge--thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the
64324. diffusion of printed matter--has the question of the freedom of will
64325. been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist. In our
64326. time the majority of so-called advanced people--that is, the crowd of
64327. ignoramuses--have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one
64328. side of the question for a solution of the whole problem.
64329. 
64330. They say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist,
64331. for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular
64332. movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves; the soul and
64333. free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang
64334. from the apes. They say this, not at all suspecting that thousands of
64335. years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now
64336. trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely
64337. acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers, but has never
64338. been denied. They do not see that the role of the natural sciences in
64339. this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination
64340. of one side of it. For the fact that, from the point of view of
64341. observation, reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain, and
64342. that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals
64343. at some unknown period of time, only explains from a fresh side
64344. the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and
64345. philosophic theories--that from the point of view of reason man is
64346. subject to the law of necessity; but it does not advance by a hair's
64347. breadth the solution of the question, which has another, opposite, side,
64348. based on the consciousness of freedom.
64349. 
64350. If men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is
64351. as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a
64352. certain period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is the
64353. time, in the second case it is the origin); and the question of how
64354. man's consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of
64355. necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative
64356. physiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, or an ape, we can
64357. observe only the muscular nervous activity, but in man we observe
64358. consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity.
64359. 
64360. The naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this
64361. question, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of
64362. a church who, availing themselves of the absence of the chief
64363. superintendent of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over the
64364. windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should be
64365. delighted that from their point of view as plasterers, everything is now
64366. so smooth and regular.
64367. 
64368. 
64369. 
64370. 
64371. 
64372. CHAPTER IX
64373. 
64374. 
64375. For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history
64376. has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the
64377. question is dealt with, that for history this question does not refer
64378. to the essence of man's free will but its manifestation in the past and
64379. under certain conditions.
64380. 
64381. In regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences as
64382. experimental science stands to abstract science.
64383. 
64384. The subject for history is not man's will itself but our presentation of
64385. it.
64386. 
64387. And so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the
64388. incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does
64389. for theology, ethics, and philosophy. History surveys a presentation of
64390. man's life in which the union of these two contradictions has already
64391. taken place.
64392. 
64393. In actual life each historic event, each human action, is very clearly
64394. and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, although
64395. each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory.
64396. 
64397. To solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and
64398. what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the philosophy
64399. of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other
64400. sciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and
64401. inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the phenomena of life
64402. under those definitions, history should deduce a definition of the
64403. conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense
64404. quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear
64405. dependent on these two elements.
64406. 
64407. Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual
64408. we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man's free
64409. will and partly of the law of inevitability.
64410. 
64411. Whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions
64412. of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someone's
64413. action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his
64414. walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and
64415. inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined
64416. for us.
64417. 
64418. Our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to
64419. differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but
64420. every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and
64421. inevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure of
64422. freedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more
64423. freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive, and
64424. the more inevitability the less freedom.
64425. 
64426. The proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases
64427. according to the point of view from which the action is regarded, but
64428. their relation is always one of inverse proportion.
64429. 
64430. A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother
64431. exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man trained
64432. to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless
64433. man--seem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the law of
64434. necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were
64435. placed, and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself
64436. drowning, that the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the ranks,
64437. and so on. Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and
64438. has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty
64439. and his action more due to the law of inevitability, to someone who
64440. considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who
64441. examined it the day after it was committed. And in the same way every
64442. action of an insane, intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less
64443. free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him
64444. who committed the action, and seems more free and less inevitable to one
64445. who does not know it. In all these cases the conception of freedom
64446. is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is
64447. correspondingly decreased or increased, according to the point of view
64448. from which the action is regarded. So that the greater the conception of
64449. necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa.
64450. 
64451. Religion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence,
64452. and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and
64453. freedom.
64454. 
64455. All cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and
64456. necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:
64457. 
64458. (1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds.
64459. 
64460. (2) His relation to time.
64461. 
64462. (3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.
64463. 
64464. The first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man's
64465. relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness
64466. of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man
64467. in relation to everything coexisting with him. This is what makes it
64468. evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity
64469. than one standing on dry ground, and that makes the actions of a man
64470. closely connected with others in a thickly populated district, or of one
64471. bound by family, official, or business duties, seem certainly less free
64472. and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and
64473. seclusion.
64474. 
64475. If we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around
64476. him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his relation
64477. to anything around him, if we see his connection with anything
64478. whatever--with a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on
64479. which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that
64480. falls on the things about him--we see that each of these circumstances
64481. has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity.
64482. And the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of
64483. his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that
64484. weighs on him increases.
64485. 
64486. The second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of
64487. the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place
64488. the man's action occupies in time. That is the ground which makes the
64489. fall of the first man, resulting in the production of the human race,
64490. appear evidently less free than a man's entry into marriage today. It is
64491. the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago
64492. and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life
64493. of a contemporary, the consequences of which are still unknown to me.
64494. 
64495. The degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this
64496. respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance
64497. of the action and our judgment of it.
64498. 
64499. If I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same
64500. circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly
64501. free. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in
64502. different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had
64503. not been committed much that resulted from it--good, agreeable, and even
64504. essential--would not have taken place. If I reflect on an action still
64505. more remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my action
64506. are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have
64507. happened had that action not been performed. The farther I go back
64508. in memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my
64509. judgment, the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my
64510. action.
64511. 
64512. In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning
64513. the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A
64514. contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the
64515. known participants, but with a more remote event we already see its
64516. inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible.
64517. And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do
64518. they appear.
64519. 
64520. The Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the
64521. crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still seem
64522. to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroes'
64523. will. But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite
64524. place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history
64525. of Europe, though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared
64526. as merely due to the will of certain people. In regard to the migration
64527. of the peoples it does not enter anyone's head today to suppose that
64528. the renovation of the European world depended on Attila's caprice. The
64529. farther back in history the object of our observation lies, the more
64530. doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and
64531. the more manifest the law of inevitability.
64532. 
64533. The third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that
64534. endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which each
64535. phenomenon comprehended, and therefore man's every action, must have
64536. its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of
64537. what will follow.
64538. 
64539. The better we are acquainted with the physiological, psychological, and
64540. historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled,
64541. and the more correctly we perceive the physiological, psychological,
64542. and historical causes of the action, and the simpler the action we are
64543. observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in
64544. question, the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our
64545. actions and those of others appear.
64546. 
64547. When we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a
64548. crime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe a
64549. greater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we most urgently
64550. demand the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we
64551. rate its merit most highly. In an indifferent case we recognize in it
64552. more individuality, originality, and independence. But if even one of
64553. the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain
64554. element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime,
64555. or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom
64556. of the apparently original action. That a criminal was reared among male
64557. factors mitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father
64558. or mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more
64559. comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less
64560. deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. The founder of a
64561. sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when we know how or by
64562. what the way was prepared for his activity. If we have a large range
64563. of examples, if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the
64564. correlation of cause and effect in people's actions, their actions
64565. appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we
64566. connect the effects with the causes. If we examined simple actions and
64567. had a vast number of such actions under observation, our conception of
64568. their inevitability would be still greater. The dishonest conduct of the
64569. son of a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen
64570. into bad company, a drunkard's relapse into drunkenness, and so on are
64571. actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause.
64572. If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage
64573. of mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton--then,
64574. knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and
64575. intelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so
64576. little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action
64577. we can foretell the result.
64578. 
64579. On these three considerations alone is based the conception of
64580. irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted
64581. by all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less
64582. according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in
64583. which the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according
64584. to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the
64585. action and its investigation, and according to the greater or lesser
64586. understanding of the causes that led to the action.
64587. 
64588. 
64589. 
64590. 
64591. 
64592. CHAPTER X
64593. 
64594. 
64595. Thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes
64596. or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the
64597. external world, the greater or lesser remoteness of time, and the
64598. greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we
64599. contemplate a man's life.
64600. 
64601. So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the
64602. external world is well known, where the time between the action and
64603. its examination is great, and where the causes of the action are most
64604. accessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a
64605. minimum of free will. If we examine a man little dependent on external
64606. conditions, whose action was performed very recently, and the causes of
64607. whose action are beyond our ken, we get the conception of a minimum of
64608. inevitability and a maximum of freedom.
64609. 
64610. In neither case--however we may change our point of view, however plain
64611. we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external
64612. world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or short the
64613. period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes
64614. of the action may be--can we ever conceive either complete freedom or
64615. complete necessity.
64616. 
64617. (1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the
64618. influence of the external world, we never get a conception of freedom
64619. in space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds
64620. him and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My action seems
64621. to me free; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every
64622. direction, I see that I raised it in the direction in which there was
64623. least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from
64624. the construction of my own body. I chose one out of all the possible
64625. directions because in it there were fewest obstacles. For my action
64626. to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles. To
64627. conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space, which is
64628. evidently impossible.
64629. 
64630. (2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the
64631. deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I examine
64632. an action committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not
64633. being free, for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was
64634. committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myself: could I have
64635. abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed? To
64636. convince myself of this I do not lift it the next moment. But I am
64637. not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when I asked the
64638. question. Time has gone by which I could not detain, the arm I then
64639. lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting,
64640. nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me. The
64641. moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable, and at that
64642. moment I could make only one movement, and whatever movement I made
64643. would be the only one. That I did not lift my arm a moment later does
64644. not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then. And since I
64645. could make only one movement at that single moment of time, it could not
64646. have been any other. To imagine it as free, it is necessary to imagine
64647. it in the present, on the boundary between the past and the future--that
64648. is, outside time, which is impossible.
64649. 
64650. (3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be
64651. increased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is,
64652. an absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the
64653. expression of will in any action, our own or another's, the first demand
64654. of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a
64655. cause no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to perform an action
64656. independently of any cause, but my wish to perform an action without a
64657. cause is the cause of my action.
64658. 
64659. But even if--imagining a man quite exempt from all influences, examining
64660. only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any cause--we were
64661. to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled
64662. zero, we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete
64663. freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by the external world, standing
64664. outside of time and independent of cause, is no longer a man.
64665. 
64666. In the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of
64667. freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.
64668. 
64669. (1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space
64670. in which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for the
64671. number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space. And
64672. therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined,
64673. there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom
64674. remains.
64675. 
64676. (2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are
64677. examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while
64678. time is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute
64679. inevitability.
64680. 
64681. (3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we
64682. shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we
64683. never reach absolute inevitability.
64684. 
64685. But besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to
64686. equal zero, we assumed in some given case--as for instance in that of a
64687. dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot--complete absence of freedom, by
64688. so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are
64689. examining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man. And
64690. so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of
64691. inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as
64692. the conception of a man's completely free action.
64693. 
64694. And so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of
64695. inevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of an
64696. infinite number of space relations, an infinitely long period of time,
64697. and an infinite series of causes.
64698. 
64699. To imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of
64700. inevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond time,
64701. and free from dependence on cause.
64702. 
64703. In the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom
64704. we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of
64705. inevitability itself, that is, a mere form without content.
64706. 
64707. In the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability we
64708. should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, and
64709. cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would
64710. be nothing, or mere content without form.
64711. 
64712. We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man's
64713. whole outlook on the universe is constructed--the incomprehensible
64714. essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.
64715. 
64716. Reason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it
64717. visibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is
64718. infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise.
64719. (3) The connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can
64720. have no end.
64721. 
64722. Consciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me,
64723. consequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed
64724. moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as living,
64725. consequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I feel myself
64726. to be the cause of every manifestation of my life.
64727. 
64728. Reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability. Consciousness
64729. gives expression to the essence of freedom.
64730. 
64731. Freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in man's
64732. consciousness. Inevitability without content is man's reason in its
64733. three forms.
64734. 
64735. Freedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines. Freedom
64736. is the content. Inevitability is the form.
64737. 
64738. Only by separating the two sources of cognition, related to one another
64739. as form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive and separately
64740. incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.
64741. 
64742. Only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man's life.
64743. 
64744. Apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one
64745. another as form and content, no conception of life is possible.
64746. 
64747. All that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free
64748. will to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the laws of reason.
64749. 
64750. All that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain
64751. relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of
64752. life to the laws of reason.
64753. 
64754. The great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of
64755. them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal
64756. force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life in man and
64757. we call that freedom.
64758. 
64759. But just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but
64760. felt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which we
64761. know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the first
64762. knowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newton's law), so too the
64763. force of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is
64764. conscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of
64765. inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies,
64766. up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws).
64767. 
64768. All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the
64769. laws of reason.
64770. 
64771. Man's free will differs from every other force in that man is directly
64772. conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from
64773. any other force. The forces of gravitation, electricity, or chemical
64774. affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are
64775. differently defined by reason. Just so the force of man's free will
64776. is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the
64777. definition reason gives it. Freedom, apart from necessity, that is,
64778. apart from the laws of reason that define it, differs in no way from
64779. gravitation, or heat, or the force that makes things grow; for reason,
64780. it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life.
64781. 
64782. And as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies,
64783. the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity, or
64784. of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of
64785. astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the
64786. same way does the force of free will form the content of history.
64787. But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this
64788. unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the
64789. subject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free will
64790. in human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause forms
64791. the subject of history, while free will itself is the subject of
64792. metaphysics.
64793. 
64794. In the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of
64795. inevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital force is
64796. only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know
64797. of the essence of life.
64798. 
64799. So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability,
64800. what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an
64801. expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of
64802. human life.
64803. 
64804. 
64805. 
64806. 
64807. 
64808. CHAPTER XI
64809. 
64810. 
64811. History examines the manifestations of man's free will in connection
64812. with the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it
64813. defines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science
64814. only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws.
64815. 
64816. The recognition of man's free will as something capable of influencing
64817. historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for
64818. history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies
64819. would be for astronomy.
64820. 
64821. That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws,
64822. that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body
64823. moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no
64824. conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If
64825. any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical law
64826. can exist, nor any conception of historical events.
64827. 
64828. For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end
64829. of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a
64830. consciousness of man's will in the present moves in space, time, and
64831. dependence on cause.
64832. 
64833. The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more
64834. evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define those laws
64835. is the problem of history.
64836. 
64837. From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its
64838. subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in
64839. man's freewill, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible,
64840. for however man's free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize
64841. it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes
64842. impossible.
64843. 
64844. Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that
64845. is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince
64846. ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then
64847. instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as
64848. its problem.
64849. 
64850. The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of
64851. thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously
64852. with the self-destruction toward which--ever dissecting and dissecting
64853. the causes of phenomena--the old method of history is moving.
64854. 
64855. All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at
64856. infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the
64857. process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration
64858. of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception
64859. of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all
64860. unknown, infinitely small, elements.
64861. 
64862. In another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences
64863. have proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say
64864. that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all
64865. bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting
64866. one another, that is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the
64867. movement of the bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies
64868. from the infinitely large to the infinitely small. The same is done by
64869. the natural sciences: leaving aside the question of cause, they seek for
64870. laws. History stands on the same path. And if history has for its object
64871. the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the
64872. narration of episodes in the lives of individuals, it too, setting
64873. aside the conception of cause, should seek the laws common to all the
64874. inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will.
64875. 
64876. 
64877. 
64878.

64883. From the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the mere
64884. recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves
64885. sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients. By disproving
64886. that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of
64887. the movements of the bodies, but without disproving it, it would seem
64888. impossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic worlds. But even after
64889. the discovery of the law of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still
64890. studied for a long time.
64891. 
64892. From the time the first person said and proved that the number of births
64893. or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this or that
64894. mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic
64895. conditions, and that certain relations of population to soil produce
64896. migrations of peoples, the foundations on which history had been built
64897. were destroyed in their essence.
64898. 
64899. By refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been
64900. retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue
64901. studying historic events as the results of man's free will. For if a
64902. certain mode of government was established or certain migrations
64903. of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic,
64904. ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will of those
64905. individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government
64906. or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.
64907. 
64908. And yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the
64909. laws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative philology,
64910. and geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.
64911. 
64912. The struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly
64913. fought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on guard for the
64914. old views and accused the new of violating revelation. But when truth
64915. conquered, theology established itself just as firmly on the new
64916. foundation.
64917. 
64918. Just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between
64919. the old and the new conception of history, and theology in the same way
64920. stands on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of subverting
64921. revelation.
64922. 
64923. In the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes
64924. passion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret for
64925. the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the other
64926. is the passion for destruction.
64927. 
64928. To the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy,
64929. it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in
64930. God, in the creation of the firmament, and in the miracle of Joshua the
64931. son of Nun. To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton, to
64932. Voltaire for example, it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed
64933. religion, and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against
64934. religion.
64935. 
64936. Just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of
64937. inevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and evil,
64938. and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on
64939. those conceptions.
64940. 
64941. So too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of
64942. inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion, though
64943. the law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus in
64944. astronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation on which
64945. the institutions of state and church are erected.
64946. 
64947. As in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of history
64948. now, the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or
64949. nonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the measure of visible
64950. phenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability of the earth, in history
64951. it is the independence of personality--free will.
64952. 
64953. As with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth
64954. lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth's fixity and of
64955. the motion of the planets, so in history the difficulty of recognizing
64956. the subjection of personality to the laws of space, time, and cause
64957. lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one's own
64958. personality. But as in astronomy the new view said: "It is true that we
64959. do not feel the movement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility
64960. we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do not
64961. feel) we arrive at laws," so also in history the new view says: "It is
64962. true that we are not conscious of our dependence, but by admitting our
64963. free will we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on
64964. the external world, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws."
64965. 
64966. In the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an
64967. unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel;
64968. in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom
64969. that does not exist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not
64970. conscious.
